Hi guys, welcome to another episode of Ultimate Bucket List
0:03
and this is your complete guide to the city of
0:06
London. Where to go, what to do, where to eat, and how to save money in
0:12
one of the most amazing cities in the world!
0:20
Ladies and gentlemen: welcome to the nation's capital!
0:24
It's an amazing place full of culture history some very very world famous
0:31
attractions and there's a lot to do here in London.
0:36
Now this is going to be quite a long video, but this will tell you
0:40
everything that you need to know about having the best time of your life
0:43
here in London. If you're short on time (and in general) there's three main areas
0:49
of London that you'll probably want to explore.
0:52
Westminster, the West End and the City of London. Most of the
0:58
famous attractions you'll have heard of reside in one of these three areas so
1:03
these are the areas I want you to kind of focus on.
1:07
I suppose I better start on telling you how to get around the place
1:10
and how to use the world famous underground system.
1:14
aka the Tube. The tube network is vast and varied and
1:20
if you look at a tube map it looks very confusing but I assure you
1:25
once you've gone into an underground station it's actually
1:28
incredibly easy to use there's plenty of signs
1:31
and you'll have to try very very hard in order to actually get
1:35
lost. Either get an oyster card or in my case just a normal credit card
1:40
tap it on one of the turnstiles and away you go.
1:44
It's literally that easy you can do the exact same thing for the London buses
1:49
and the London boats and these three combined you'll be able
1:53
to get across the city within minutes. Be very careful though because the tube
1:58
map is widely not to scale and sometimes it's quicker to walk than
2:02
it is to use the tube, so bear that in mind. If you're looking
2:06
for a place to stay, I highly recommend staying
2:09
around the West end or the theatre district
2:12
especially if you like nightlife it's perfect.
2:16
But also, it seems to be roughly the centre of London
2:19
so if you stay anywhere around here especially next to a tube station
2:23
you'll thank me when you can get around the city very very easily.
2:30
Let's start by heading towards one of the more famous areas
2:33
of London. Westminster ... and I suppose I’d better start by
2:38
telling you about this big thing here. Officially it's called the Elizabeth
2:43
Tower but most people know this as Big Ben. It's a bit of a misnomer
2:49
because Big Ben actually refers to the bell inside the
2:52
clock tower rather than the actual clock tower
2:55
itself. This is one of the most iconic images of
2:59
London and when you've seen photos or videos of
3:02
this it looks pretty much like this. However
3:06
when I arrived, it looks more like this: very very much under construction!
3:13
They're currently renovating it and it won't be ready for quite a few
3:17
years but hopefully when you come to London it will look
3:20
significantly better. Right next to Big Ben are the Houses of
3:24
Parliament. Now, believe it or not this is where our
3:28
government resides and does its business and furthermore, you can actually go
3:33
inside! Yes, whilst parliament is in session you
3:36
can actually attend parliament. All you have to do is queue and if
3:41
there's room in the gallery they'll security check you, and you can
3:44
actually watch the proceedings. That is if you can stand all the
3:48
[bullsh*t] that goes on in this place. If you don't want to go inside, that's
3:52
okay, there's plenty of good photo opportunities in and around
3:57
Westminster, Rather conveniently right next to
4:01
Westminster is Westminster Abbey. This is the famous
4:05
cathedral where the coronations happen, royal
4:08
weddings happen and it's an amazing place to go into.
4:13
I highly recommend that you do go into Westminster Abbey
4:17
this along with Saint Paul’s is one of the most famous churches
4:20
in all of London, and it's probably a place that you've seen on the TV and
4:24
movies many times. To get the best
4:28
possible shots of Westminster you'll need to cross the bridge
4:33
so over the bridge you go and that's pretty much the best viewpoint.
4:37
Obviously when you come here hopefully you won't have so much scaffolding all
4:40
over it. Boy it's unsightly but it'll be nice
4:43
when it's done. But whilst walking across the river
4:46
you'll notice a big giant ferris wheel on the other side.
4:51
This is the famous London Eye. Yes it's a big giant ferris wheel and yes
4:57
they're pretty much in every major city nowadays,
5:00
But it's still nice to go around and the views from the top
5:04
are simply incredible as you can imagine though it's busy and
5:10
you'll need to book way in advance. But the views more than
5:13
make up for it whilst walking around the London Eye
5:17
you'll notice other attractions such as the London dungeons which I
5:20
highly recommend. It's pretty scary but cool at the same
5:24
time and it's also a nice place to chill out
5:27
with a cold beverage overlooking the River Thames and
5:30
Westminster so yes definitely a good place to stop if
5:34
you do want something nice to look at. This area has some very very ornate looking
5:40
pubs and I highly recommend if you've never
5:42
been to an English pub before go into one of these. Nearby Westminster
5:47
Abbey you'll walk through St James’s Park aka the royal park
5:53
there's a reason why they call it a royal park is because right next door
5:57
is one of the most famous attractions that people come and see.
6:01
Buckingham Palace. This is the Queen's official home
6:05
though she doesn't actually consider this her home she considers Windsor
6:08
Castle her home but point beside, this is officially
6:11
where she resides most of the time. If the royal standard
6:15
is flying high it means that she's actually
6:17
there. Believe it or not you can actually go on tours
6:22
around Buckingham palace but they are rare, they usually happen between July
6:27
and October when the Queen is officially not in residence. But you have to book
6:32
way in advance and is pretty expensive so most tourists generally hang around
6:37
the gates and take pictures of the palace and the
6:40
monument in front of it. And they also hang around for the
6:44
Changing of the Guard Ceremony which happens at roughly 11 o'clock
6:48
every day. Due to Covid, it's not been happening
6:51
with as much pomp and circumstance as you see in this video
6:55
but hopefully by the time you arrive here in London everything will return to
6:59
normal and you'll be able to see this again.
7:03
The footage you're seeing here I actually shot this back in October
7:06
and it's a decent view but I would have loved to have been a bit closer to the
7:10
gates because that's where pretty much all the main stuff happens. But if you
7:14
are watching the changing of the guard ceremony
7:17
I highly recommend that you actually follow the guards down the road
7:20
because they actually march towards St James’s Palace
7:24
which in itself is an attraction so that's kind of cool to see.
7:28
If you guys want me to make another video about the changing of the guard
7:31
ceremony let me know in the comment section below.
7:35
That's basically Westminster in a nutshell now it's time to go to the
7:39
opposite end of the city. The City of London. Originally the City
7:44
of London is this one square mile bit of the city
7:49
it's part of the old roman city of Londinium that used to stand there
7:53
but has now been amalgamated into the greater city of London.
7:57
Now it's a big giant financial and business district
8:00
one of the most powerful in the world.
8:04
Admittedly the actual city of London itself isn't that interesting,
8:08
yes it's got a few nice buildings but the main two things that you'll need to
8:12
visit while you're here in the City of London
8:14
is famous Tower Bridge and the Tower of London now I’ve
8:19
actually made a separate video about the Tower of London
8:22
right here, but in short this is where famous monarchs traditionally lived
8:27
and is currently home to the crown jewels the most expensive
8:31
and priceless jewellery in the country. Check out my video here!
8:36
The other famous landmark that most people associate with London:
8:41
Tower Bridge. Now I know a lot of you will be asking
8:44
can you actually go inside and the answer is
8:48
yes! You can pay a small admission fee and go up one of the towers
8:52
and walk across the bridge at the top there where they've got a glass roof
8:57
and a glass floor so that's pretty interesting.
9:00
Most of the time tourists are just happy to walk along the bridge
9:04
and take various photos of it and it is a very pretty bridge.
9:09
To get the best possible shots of tower bridge you'll need to basically be
9:13
next to the Tower of London or on the other side of the river
9:17
on the west side. The views of the tower bridge from the east side aren't very good so
9:22
these two are probably the best views of Tower Bridge you're going to get.
9:27
But guys, this is one of the most famous bridges if not the most famous bridge
9:31
in the world and I highly recommend that you take your time
9:34
and take some lovely pictures here. Particularly at night
9:38
it glows like a Christmas tree. There's some
9:41
very very nice riverside eateries next to tower bridge that I highly recommend
9:46
that you check out.
9:49
Whilst you're on the west side of the bridge, you'll notice a big giant warship
9:53
the HMS Belfast which you can pay to go inside but
9:57
it is a warship. But a few streets away you'll find this London’s tallest
10:03
building. The Shard: it's mainly residential and
10:07
office blocks, but you can actually pay and go to the
10:10
observation tower where you get some pretty good amazing
10:14
views of London. Whilst you're up there you'll notice a
10:19
cathedral on the other side of the water this is the other famous church in
10:24
London - Saint Paul’s Cathedral. It's pretty amazing on the inside and I
10:30
highly recommend that you do go but also once you've checked out the
10:33
cathedral check out the bridge that's directly opposite it.
10:38
This is the infamous Millennium Bridge a bridge that when first opened wobbled
10:43
like crazy is now incredibly stable, and it provides
10:47
you some excellent photo opportunities. So especially if you're a photographer
10:51
or a videographer you can get some amazing views
10:54
of Tower Bridge, Saint Paul’s, The Shard it's a pretty good photography and
11:00
videography spot. But as night falls and you want to be
11:04
entertained there's only one place you need to go:
11:09
The West End aka the theatre district. This is London’s answer to Broadway and
11:15
arguably better than Broadway! There are lots of
11:19
traditional theatres around here where you can take in a
11:22
musical or a show. The nightlife around here is pretty damn
11:27
amazing the west end encompasses Covent Garden
11:31
where there's lots of theatres around Leicester Square which is a public
11:34
square full of shops casinos and Chinatown is nearby, the
11:39
largest Chinatown in the country. Piccadilly Circus which is home to these
11:44
giant LED screens and at night they look pretty damn
11:47
amazing. And it's also home to Oxford Street the
11:52
longest shopping street in London. So if you like to shop or be
11:56
entertained the West End is definitely the place to
11:59
go. Especially if you're a person of the
12:02
night the red-light district is in Soho which is also the West
12:06
End ... if you like that sort of thing?! You'll find everything here in the West
12:12
End and there's several underground tube stops that are
12:15
right next to each other. So when I told you in the beginning of
12:18
the video that you should stay in the West End
12:21
now you see why. Whilst we're here at the west End
12:24
I’ll also like to mention that this is home to the best cuisine
12:28
in the city. You can find anything from cheap Asian street food
12:34
to money is no object restaurants. Seriously you can have it
12:38
all here in the West End. And it's a great place to hang out even
12:42
if you just want to watch the world go by.
12:45
You can do this pretty much here at Trafalgar square
12:48
whereby you've got the National Gallery behind you and yes that's free of charge
12:52
and you're able to go into it. These are the three main areas that I
12:57
think you should explore whilst you're in London. If you've only
13:00
got a short time you could do one area per day and see
13:04
most of what London has to offer in two or three days. But if you've got
13:09
more time and you're willing to travel a bit further
13:12
there's some very interesting places. Let's start with West London and Hyde
13:18
Park. This is the largest green space here in
13:21
London It's a lovely park to kind of get away
13:25
from the hustle and bustle of the city. Right on the side of Hyde Park is the
13:30
Royal Albert Hall, the most famous music venue here in
13:34
London. It's home to the last night of the proms
13:38
and if you do manage to catch a proms show I highly recommend it. Yes
13:43
it's classical music but it's a fine representation
13:47
of British society. Whilst you're around here you'll notice
13:52
that you're in the borough of Kensington and Chelsea
13:55
the richest and most exclusive area of London.
13:59
And nothing screams fancy and decadence rather than Kensington Palace
14:04
which is definitely definitely worth a look.
14:08
What's also worth a look is Harrods, the famous department store.
14:13
If you want to see celebrities do their shopping this is a place to go because
14:17
quite frankly it's expensive here!
14:21
This is where the Queen famously does her shopping and where celebrities like
14:25
Michael Jackson go to buy literally everything!
14:30
This area is also home to some of the city's most famous museums,
14:34
the Science Museum, the Victoria and Albert Museum
14:38
which is also known as the V&A. And my personal favourite
14:42
the Natural History Museum which is amazing inside.
14:47
And once again it's free of charge to enter.
14:52
If museums are your thing you'll also need to check out the north side of the
14:55
city. Madame Tussauds is famously on Baker
14:59
Street and this is the original Madame Tussauds
15:02
that actually opened There are Madame Tussauds everywhere in
15:06
the world these days, but this is the original and best.
15:11
Because it's on Baker Street it's also home to the Sherlock Holmes Museum
15:15
so if you go to Sherlock Holmes' house at 221B Baker Street
15:19
you'll find the Sherlock Holmes Museum.
15:23
Nearby Regents Park is home to the ZSL London Zoo.
15:26
So if you want to see some animals go to Regents Park.
15:32
The British Museum is also located here in the north side of the city,
15:36
and it has the most stunning roof that you'll ever see. And the museum itself
15:41
pretty damn good and once again it's free of charge to go into.
15:46
If you do like modern art, the Tate modern is
15:50
located in the south side of the city on the south bank.
15:54
By law here in the UK, most state-funded museums
15:57
have to be free of charge to enter and most of the important ones I’ve
16:01
mentioned so far are free so if you are on a budget, some
16:05
of these museums are definitely a good way to waste some
16:08
time and take in some culture. But what else is that to do? If you're
16:14
willing to travel a little bit further there's the O2 Arena which is formerly
16:20
known as the Millennium Dome. This is the
16:23
modern concert venue that's in the city and you can take in concerts, basketball
16:28
games, ice hockey here Visit Canary Wharf which is an ultra
16:32
modern financial district. Admittedly it's kind of like Dubai but
16:37
British and crappy weather. There's not all that much to do apart
16:41
from look at the lovely buildings. But one area I do recommend that you
16:46
visit is the area of Greenwich. This is home to the famous
16:51
Royal Greenwich Observatory and this is where time begins.
16:56
Seriously I’m not joking, all time is based off Greenwich Mean Time (GMT).
17:00
which is this line here on the meridian. You can
17:04
actually pay to go in the Greenwich Observatory and there's a lot of
17:07
interesting artefacts, there's a lot of interesting instruments,
17:13
and you can take a stereotypical video or picture of you walking along the
17:16
prime meridian line ... just like I’m doing right now.
17:21
You can easily waste a morning here at the Greenwich Observatory
17:25
but right next door to that is The Queen's House.
17:28
Contrary to popular belief, the Queen's house isn't actually
17:32
the Queen's House, it's actually an art gallery - nothing to do with the Queen!
17:38
And you've also got the National Maritime Museum which is quite
17:41
interesting. If you like the sea or navy or boats the
17:45
National Maritime Museum is quite interesting. Speaking of boats
17:50
London’s most famous boat is moored permanently on land,
17:55
This is the Cutty Sark, at one point this was the fastest tea clipper in the
18:01
world. And was so important to the tea trade
18:04
with China. Nowadays it's been fully restored and
18:08
put on land, But when you go around the inside of it
18:12
it's actually quite interesting to see how it used to work back in the day.
18:17
And I’ve never been on a wooden clipper galleon before
18:20
but I found it really interesting. Yes and let's ring the bell just for fun.
18:25
Greenwich can be a pain in the backside to get to using the tube system
18:30
so I highly recommend using the boats instead.
18:34
Now you can actually use the boats just like you use the tube system.
18:37
And if you're wondering why I’m taking a video of this particular old woman,
18:42
she couldn't stop farting so she left me a trail of farts
18:46
whilst I was walking behind her ... dirty woman!
18:50
But anyway, to use the boats it's dead easy. All you have to do
18:53
is scan in just like you would on a tube. Get on the boat,
18:58
enjoy a lovely boat ride down the Thames and when you get to the destination of
19:02
your choice, literally tap back out again. A lot of
19:05
locals and a lot of tourists don't know about the boats
19:09
and I highly recommend that you actually use them to get around
19:12
especially if you're going between Westminster and the City of London,
19:16
or Westminster and Greenwich. It's by far easier to use the boat than it is to use
19:21
the tube system especially if you're going to Greenwich.
19:26
Off the beaten path in the north end of the city you'll find
19:29
Camden Town. It's famous for its world famous
19:33
Camden market, one of the traditional marketplaces of the city
19:37
it's now home to a whole plethora of different things that you can look
19:42
taste and buy. And if you like your sports
19:46
the national Cricket ground at Lord's is nearby.
19:51
And if you are a big sports fan you'll find that London is home to some of our
19:55
national stadiums we have the national Rugby stadium
19:59
Twickenham in the south side of the city. The national cricket ground which I’ve
20:03
already mentioned, and the national football stadium
20:07
at Wembley. London as you can imagine is also home to several of the world's most
20:12
famous football teams, all of them play along the outskirts and
20:17
some of them can be a bit of a pain to get to.
20:19
But I highly recommend that you take in a game if you get a chance.
20:23
I’m not going to talk too much about them because I’ve made separate videos
20:26
of them all right here but suffice to say
20:28
London and sports is synonymous. Finally if you're willing to venture a
20:34
little bit more outside the block, go to Windsor! Windsor is a town that's
20:40
23 miles west of London it's a quaint little traditional town
20:44
but it's home to Windsor castle. The place that the Queen actually calls
20:48
home. Once again I made a separate video about it
20:52
right here, and I highly recommend you check that out!
20:56
Overall guys, London is a place that you won't find boring.
21:00
It's a multicultural diverse city that has some very interesting things
21:05
every step of the way. If you've never been to London in your life
21:08
I recommend that you add this to your bucket list immediately,
21:12
like right now! Okay Ninh, I’m sold what do I need to do? Well you need to
21:17
come here to London it's one of the most famous cities in
21:21
all of the free world and you really won't struggle to find
21:24
flights here. London is served by six major airports and five of which
21:27
are nowhere near London. You'll probably come across Heathrow
21:31
and it will take you literally half an hour on a train to get here because it's
21:35
actually quite far out. The tube is cheaper but it takes
21:39
significantly longer. Driving to London isn't recommended
21:44
because London traffic is notoriously terrible, and there's even
21:48
a congestion charge if you drive within the City of London.
21:52
Overall I highly recommend that it's not worth driving and you're better off
21:55
using public transport. Speaking of whic,h the tube is by far the
22:01
best way of getting around the city. It costs the same to use the buses and
22:05
water boats as well, so take advantage of those especially if
22:09
you're visiting Greenwich. The tube map is widely not to scale so
22:14
look on an actual map before you go anywhere because sometimes
22:18
it's actually quicker to walk to these places than to use the tubes.
22:24
Using the tube system can look pretty complicated but I assure you
22:28
it's actually very very easy. You'll need your contactless credit card
22:32
or if you don't have that fill up an oyster card at any station
22:36
and use that instead. One of the things that other tourist guides
22:40
don't tell you is to actually use the river buses.
22:43
Now this is an actual cool way to see the city along the River Thames
22:48
and it provides you some excellent photo opportunities.You can use
22:51
buses don't bother with taxis because they can get quite pricey.
22:56
If you're looking for a place to stay I highly recommend that you stay
23:00
in the West End, it's full of shops entertainment there's plenty of tube
23:04
stations around so you can get virtually anywhere.
23:06
And it's considered to be the centre point of London
23:10
Westminster is a very close second. Usually when I stay here
23:15
I stay close to Westminster Abbey or Piccadilly Circus tube station because
23:19
with those two places I can get around the city very easily.
23:23
Everything like Buckingham Palace, Westminster Abbey, Big
23:26
Ben, the London Eye - a lot of these things are within walking distance so I
23:30
highly recommend that especially if you don't want to waste
23:33
time traveling, stay around the west end area. The only other
23:38
attractions that aren't near the West End that you probably most
23:41
likely do, is this Tower Bridge and that over there the
23:45
Tower of London. The cost to do things like attractions,
23:48
well, as you can imagine from a major capital city
23:51
attractions can be quite expensive and if you choose to eat out
23:55
that can quickly add up too. But to be honest
23:59
it's nowhere near the most expensive city in the world that you'll come
24:02
across. So in all honesty it's not bad!
24:06
Is there anything else? Yes, a lot of guides won't tell you that you'll be
24:11
walking quite a significant distance, the tube stations are massive and you'll be
24:15
walking everywhere. So arm yourself with
24:20
comfortable shoes and I think you'll be absolutely fine. At
24:23
least you'll be losing weight after you come back from London. Also a
24:28
lot of places here in London are now becoming cashless i.e. you can't
24:32
use proper money. So make sure that you've got a
24:34
contactless credit card, because most retailers actually prefer that to
24:38
you handing them cash. Thanks a lot Covid! There's helpful maps
24:43
everywhere so it's actually pretty hard to get lost in London
24:46
even though it's quite an expansive city.
24:50
Currently there are covered restrictions, so lots of social distancing
24:54
hand sanitizers, face masks are compulsory in various areas etc.
24:59
especially when using public transport, so bear that in mind
25:02
if you are coming to London during this pandemic.
25:06
A lot of people asking me about the tour buses.
25:09
If you've got absolutely no intentions of going into the attractions,
25:14
but actually want to go and see them, use the tour buses because
25:17
they will provide you a quick overview of London,
25:20
even though you probably won't actually go into any of these things.
25:23
And once again check the maps of the attractions that you want to do because
25:27
sometimes it's quicker to use the boat or a bus than it is to use the tube
25:31
system, so bear that in mind. But guys London is a wonderful city and
25:37
I’m pretty sure that you'll have a fantastic time here.
