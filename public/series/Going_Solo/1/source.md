The Voyage Out




The ship that was carrying me away from England to Africa in the autumn of 1938 was called the SS Mantola.

She was an old paint-peeling tub of 9,000 tons with a single tall funnel and a vibrating engine that rattled the tea-cups in their saucers on the dining-room table.

The voyage from the Port of London to Mombasa would take two weeks and on the way we were going to call in at Marseilles, Malta, Port Said, Suez, Port Sudan and Aden.

Nowadays you can fly to Mombasa in a few hours and you stop nowhere and nothing is fabulous any more,

but in 1938 a journey like that was full of stepping-stones and East Africa was a long way from home,

especially if your contract with the Shell Company said that you were to stay out there for three years at a stretch.

I was twenty-two when I left.

I would be twenty-five before I saw my family again.

What I still remember so clearly about that voyage is the extraordinary behaviour of my fellow passengers.

I had never before encountered that peculiar Empire-building breed of Englishman who spends his whole life working in distant corners of British territory.

Please do not forget that in the 1930s the British Empire was still very much the British Empire,

and the men and women who kept it going were a race of people that most of you have never encountered and now you never will.

I consider myself very lucky to have caught a glimpse of this rare species while it still roamed the forests and foothills of the earth, for today it is totally extinct.

More English than the English, more Scottish than the Scots, they were the craziest bunch of humans I shall ever meet.

For one thing, they spoke a language of their own.

If they worked in East Africa, their sentences were sprinkled with Swahili words, and if they lived in India then all manner of dialects were intermingled.

As well as this, there was a whole vocabulary of much-used words that seemed to be universal among all these people.

An evening drink, for example, was always a sundowner.

A drink at any other time was a chota peg.

One’s wife was the memsahib.

To have a look at something was to have a shufti.

And from that one, interestingly enough, RAF/Middle East slang for a reconnaissance plane in the last war was a shufti kite.

Something of poor quality was shenzi.

Supper was tiffin and so on and so forth.

The Empire-builders’ jargon would have filled a dictionary.

All in all, it was rather wonderful for me, a conventional young lad from the suburbs,

to be thrust suddenly into the middle of this pack of sinewy sunburnt gophers and their bright bony little wives,

and what I liked best of all about them was their eccentricities.



It would seem that when the British live for years in a foul and sweaty climate among foreign people

they maintain their sanity by allowing themselves to go slightly dotty.

They cultivate bizarre habits that would never be tolerated back home,

whereas in far-away Africa or in Ceylon or in India or in the Federated Malay States they could do as they liked.

On the SS Mantola just about everybody had his or her own particular maggot in the brain,

and for me it was like watching a kind of non-stop pantomime throughout the entire voyage.

Let me tell you about two or three of these comedians.

I was sharing my cabin with the manager of a cotton mill in the Punjab called U.N.

Savory (I could hardly believe those initials when I first saw them on his trunk) and I had the upper berth.

From my pillow I could therefore look out of the port-hole clear across the lifeboat deck and over the wide blue ocean beyond.

On our fourth morning at sea I happened to wake up very early.

I lay in my bunk gazing idly through the port-hole and listening to the gentle snores of U.N.

Savory, who lay immediately below me.

Suddenly, the figure of a naked man, naked as a jungle ape, went swooshing past the port-hole and disappeared!

He had come and gone in absolute silence and I lay there wondering whether perhaps I had seen a phantom or a vision or even a naked ghost.

A minute or two later the naked figure went by again!

This time I sat up sharply.

I wanted to get a better look at this leafless phantom of the sunrise, so I crawled down to the foot of my bunk and stuck my head through the port-hole.

The lifeboat deck was deserted.

The Mediterranean was calm and milky blue and a brilliant yellow sun was just edging up over the horizon.

The deck was so empty and silent that I began to wonder seriously whether I might not after all have seen a genuine apparition,

the ghost perhaps of a passenger who had fallen overboard on an earlier voyage

and who now spent his eternal life running above the waves and clambering back on to his lost ship.

All of a sudden, from my little spy-hole, I spotted a movement at the far end of the deck.

Then a naked body materialized.

But this was no ghost.

It was all too solid flesh, and the man was moving swiftly over the deck between the lifeboats and the ventilators and making no sound at all as he came galloping towards me.

He was short and stocky and slightly pot-bellied in his nakedness, with a big black moustache on his face,

and when he was twenty yards away he caught sight of my silly head sticking out of the port-hole and he waved a hairy arm at me and called out,

‘Come along, my boy! Come and join me in a canter! Blow some sea air into your lungs! Get yourself in trim! Shake off the flab!’

By his moustache alone I recognized him as Major Griffiths,

a man who had told me only the night before at the dinner table

how he had spent thirty-six years in India and was returning once again to Allahabad after the usual home leave.

I smiled weakly at the Major as he went prancing by, but I didn’t pull back.

I wanted to see him again.

There was something rather admirable about the way he was galloping round and round the deck with no clothes on at all,

something wonderfully innocent and unembarrassed and cheerful and friendly.

And here was I, a bundle of youthful self-consciousness, gaping at him through the port-hole and disapproving quite strongly of what he was doing.

But I was also envying him.

I was actually jealous of his total don’t-give-a-damn attitude, and I wished like mad that I myself had the guts to go out there and do the same thing.

I wanted to be like him.

I longed to be able to fling off my pyjamas and go scampering round the deck in the altogether and to hell with anyone who happened to see me.

But not in a million years could I have done it.

I waited for him to come round again.

Ah, there he was! I could see him far away down the deck, the gallant galloping Major who didn’t give a fig for anybody,

and I decided right then that I would say something very casual to him this time to show him I was ‘one of the gang’ and that I had not even noticed his nakedness.

But hang on a minute! … What was this? … There was someone with him! … There was another fellow scooting along beside him this time! … As naked as the Major he was, too!

… What on earth was going on aboard this ship? … Did all the male passengers get up at dawn and go tearing round the deck with no clothes on?

… Was this some Empire-building body-building ritual I didn’t know about? … The two were coming closer now … My God, the second one looked like a woman!

… It was a woman! … A naked woman as bare-bosomed as Venus de Milo

… But there the resemblance ceased for I could see now that this scrawny white-skinned figure was none other than Mrs Major Griffiths herself

… I froze in my port-hole and my eyes became riveted on this nude female scarecrow galloping ever so proudly alongside her bare-skinned spouse,

her elbows bent and her head held high, as much as to say, ‘Aren’t we a jolly fine couple, the two of us, and isn’t he a fine figure of a man, my husband the Major?’

‘Come along there!’ the Major called out to me.

‘If the little memsahib can do it, so can you! Fifty times round the deck is only four miles!’

‘Lovely morning,’ I murmured as they went galloping by.

‘Beautiful day.’

A couple of hours later, I was sitting opposite the Major and his little memsahib at breakfast in the dining-room,

and the knowledge that not long ago I had seen that same little memsahib with not a stitch on her made my spine creep.

I kept my head down and pretended neither of them were there.

‘Ha!’ the Major cried suddenly.

‘Aren’t you the young fellow who had his head sticking through the port-hole this morning?’

‘Who, me?’ I murmured, keeping my nose in the cornflakes.

‘Yes, you!’ the Major cried, triumphant.

‘I never forget a face!’

‘I … I was just getting a breath of air,’ I mumbled.

‘You were getting a darn sight more than that!’ the Major cried out, grinning.

‘You were getting an eyeful of the memsahib, that’s what you were doing!’

The whole of our table of eight people suddenly became silent and looked in my direction.

I felt my cheeks beginning to boil.

‘I can’t say I blame you,’ the Major went on, giving his wife an enormous wink.

It was his turn to be proud and gallant now.

‘In fact, I don’t blame you at all.

Would you blame him?’ he asked, addressing the rest of the table.

‘After all, we’re only young once.

And, as the poet says …’ he paused, giving the dreadful wife another colossal wink … ‘a thing of beauty is a joy for ever.’

‘Oh, do shut up, Bonzo,’ the wife said, loving it.

‘Back in Allahabad,’ the Major said, looking at me now, ‘I make a point of playing half-a-dozen chukkas every morning before breakfast.

Can’t do that on board ship, you know.

So I have to get my exercise in other ways.’

I sat there wondering how one played this game of chuckers.

‘Why can’t you do it?’ I said, desperate to change the subject.

‘Why can’t I do what?’ the Major said.

‘Play chuckers on the ship?’ I said.

The Major was one of those men who chewed his porridge.

He stared at me with pale-grey glassy eyes, chewing slowly.

‘I hope you’re not trying to tell me that you have never played polo in your life,’ he said.

‘Polo,’ I said.

‘Ah yes, of course, polo.

At school we used to play it on bicycles with hockey sticks.’

The Major’s stare switched suddenly to a fierce glare and he stopped chewing.

He glared at me with such contempt and horror, and his face went so crimson, I thought he might be going to have a seizure.

From then on, neither the Major nor his wife would have anything to do with me.

They changed their table in the dining-room and they cut me dead whenever we met on deck.

I had been found guilty of a great and unforgivable crime.

I had jeered, or so they thought, at the game of polo, the sacred sport of Anglo-Indians and royalty.

Only a bounder would do that.

Then there was the elderly Miss Trefusis, who quite often sat at the same dining-room table as me.

Miss Trefusis was all bones and grey skin, and when she walked her body was bent forward in a long curve like a boomerang.

She told me she owned a small coffee farm in the highlands of Kenya and that she had known Baroness Blixen very well.

I myself had read and loved both Out of Africa and Seven Gothic Tales,

and I listened enthralled to everything Miss Trefusis told me about that fine writer who called herself Isak Dinesen.

‘She was dotty, of course,’ Miss Trefusis said.

‘Like all of us who live out there, she went completely dotty in the end.’

‘You aren’t dotty,’ I said.

‘Oh yes, I am,’ she said firmly and very seriously.

‘Everyone on this ship is as dotty as a dumpling.

You don’t notice it because you’re young.

Young people are not watchful.

They only look at themselves.’

‘I saw Major Griffiths and his wife running round the deck naked the other morning,’ I said.

‘You call that dotty?’ Miss Trefusis said with a snort.

‘That’s normal.’

‘I didn’t think so.’

‘You’ve got a few shocks coming to you, young man, before you’re very much older, you mark my words,’ she said.

‘People go quite barmy when they live too long in Africa.

That’s where you’re off to, isn’t it?’

‘Yes,’ I said.

‘You’ll go barmy for sure,’ she said, ‘like the rest of us.’

She was eating an orange at the time and I noticed suddenly that she was not eating it in the normal way.

In the first place she had speared it from the fruit bowl with her fork instead of taking it in her fingers.

And now, with knife and fork, she was making a series of neat incisions in the skin all around the orange.

Then, very delicately, using the points of her knife and fork, she peeled the skin away in eight separate pieces, leaving the bare fruit beautifully exposed.

Still using knife and fork, she separated the juicy segments and began to eat them slowly, one by one, with her fork.

‘Do you always eat an orange like that?’ I said.

‘Of course.’

‘May I ask why?’

‘I never touch anything I eat with my fingers,’ she said.

‘Good Lord, don’t you really?’

‘Never. I haven’t since I was twenty-two.’

‘Is there a reason for that?’ I asked her.

‘Of course there’s a reason. Fingers are filthy.’

‘But you wash your hands.’

‘I don’t sterilize them,’ Miss Trefusis said.

‘Nor do you. They’re full of bugs.

Disgusting dirty things, fingers.

Just think what you do with them!’

I sat there going through the things I did with my fingers.

‘It doesn’t bear thinking about, does it?’ Miss Trefusis said.

‘Fingers are just implements.

They are the gardening implements of the body, the shovels and the forks.

You push them into everything.’

‘We seem to survive,’ I said.

‘Not for long you won’t,’ she said darkly.

I watched her eating her orange, spearing the little boats one after the other with her fork.

I could have told her that the fork wasn’t sterilized either, but I kept quiet.

‘Toes are even worse,’ she said suddenly.

‘I beg your pardon?’

‘They’re the worst of all,’ she said.

‘What’s wrong with toes?’

‘They are the nastiest part of the human body!’ she announced vehemently.

‘Worse than fingers?’

‘There’s no comparison,’ she snapped.

‘Fingers are foul and filthy, but toes! Toes are reptilian and viperish! I don’t wish to talk about them!’

I was getting a bit confused.

‘But one doesn’t eat with one’s toes,’ I said.

‘I never said you did,’ Miss Trefusis snapped.

‘Then what’s so awful about them?’ I persisted.

‘Uck!’ she said.

‘They are like little worms sticking out of your feet.

I hate them, I hate them! I can’t bear to look at them!’

‘Then how do you cut your toenails?’

‘I don’t,’ she said.

‘My boy does it for me.’

I wondered why she was ‘Miss’ if she’d been married and had a boy of her own.

Perhaps he was illegitimate.

‘How old is your son?’ I asked, treading carefully.

‘No, no, no!’ she cried.

‘Don’t you know anything? A “boy” is one’s native servant.

Didn’t you learn that when you read Isak Dinesen?’

‘Ah yes, of course,’ I said, remembering.

Absentmindedly I took an orange myself and was about to start peeling it.

‘Don’t,’ Miss Trefusis said, shuddering.

‘You’ll catch something if you do that. Use your knife and fork. Go on. Try it.’

I tried it. It was rather fun.

There was something satisfying about cutting the skin to just the right depth and then peeling away the segments.

‘There you are,’ she said.

‘Well done.’

‘Do you employ a lot of “boys” on your coffee farm?’ I asked her.

‘About fifty,’ she said.

‘Do they go barefoot?’

‘Mine don’t,’ she said.

‘No one works for me without shoes on.

It costs me a fortune, but it’s worth it.’

I liked Miss Trefusis.

She was impatient, intelligent, generous and interesting.

I felt she would come to my rescue at any time, whereas Major Griffiths was vapid, vulgar, arrogant and unkind, the sort of man who’d leave you to the crocodiles.

He might even push you in.

Both of them, of course, were completely dotty.

Everyone on the ship was dotty, but none, as it turned out, was quite as dotty as my cabin companion, U.N. Savory.

The first sign of his dottiness was revealed to me one evening as our ship was running between Malta and Port Said.

It had been a stifling hot afternoon and I was having a brief rest on my upper berth before dressing for dinner.

Dressing? Oh yes, indeed.

We all dressed for dinner every single evening on board that ship.

The male species of the Empire-builder, whether he is camping in the jungle or is at sea in a rowing-boat, always dresses for dinner,

and by that I mean white shirt, black tie, dinner-jacket, black trousers and black patent-leather shoes, the full regalia, and to hell with the climate.

I lay still on my bunk with my eyes half open.

Below me, U.N. Savory was getting dressed.

There wasn’t room in the cabin for two of us to change our clothes simultaneously, so we took it in turns to go first.

It was his turn to dress first tonight.

He had tied his bow-tie and now he was putting on his black dinner-jacket.

I was watching him rather dreamily through half-closed eyes, and I saw him reaching into his sponge-bag and take out a small carton.

He stationed himself in front of the washbasin mirror, took the lid off the carton and dipped his fingers into it.

The fingers came out with a pinch of white powder or crystals, and this stuff he proceeded to sprinkle very carefully over the shoulders of his dinner-jacket.

Then he replaced the lid on the carton and put it back in the sponge-bag.

Suddenly I was fully alert.

What on earth was the man up to? I didn’t want him to know I’d seen, so I closed my eyes and pretended to be asleep.

This is a rum business, I thought.

Why in the world would U.N.

Savory want to sprinkle white stuff on to the shoulders of his dinner-jacket? And what was it, anyway?

Could it be some subtle perfume or a magic aphrodisiac? I waited until he had left the cabin, then, feeling only slightly guilty,

I hopped down from my bunk and opened his sponge-bag.

EPSOM SALTS, it said on the little carton! And Epsom salts it was! Now what good could Epsom salts possibly do him sprinkled on his shoulders?

I had always thought of him as a queer fish, a man with secrets, though I hadn’t discovered what they were.

Under his bunk he kept a tin trunk and a black leather case.

There was nothing odd about the tin trunk, but the case puzzled me.

It was roughly the size of a violin case but the lid didn’t bulge as the lid of a violin case does, and it wasn’t tapered.

It was simply a three-foot-long rectangular leather box with two very strong brass locks on it.

‘Do you play the violin?’ I had once said to him.

‘Don’t be daft,’ he had answered.

‘I don’t even play the gramophone.’

Perhaps it contained a sawn-off shotgun then, I told myself.

It was about the right size.

I put the carton of Epsom salts back in his sponge-bag, then I took a shower, dressed and went upstairs to have a drink before dinner.

There was one stool vacant at the bar so I sat down and ordered a glass of beer.

There were eight sinewy sunburnt gophers including U.N. Savory sitting on high stools at the bar.

The stools were screwed to the floor.

The bar was semi-circular so that everyone could talk across to everyone else.

U.N. Savory was sitting about five places away from me.

He was drinking a gimlet, which was the Empire-builder’s name for a gin with lime juice in it.

I sat there listening to the small talk about pig-sticking and polo and how curry will cure constipation.

I felt a total outsider.

There was nothing I could contribute to the conversation so I stopped listening and concentrated on trying to solve the riddle of the Epsom salts.

I glanced at U.N. Savory.

From where I sat, I could actually see the tiny white crystals on his shoulders.

Then a funny thing happened.

U.N. Savory suddenly began brushing the Epsom salts off one of his shoulders with his hand.

He did it ostentatiously, slapping the shoulder quite hard and saying at the same time in a rather loud voice,

‘Ruddy dandruff! I’m fed up with it! Do any of you fellers know a good cure?’

‘Try coconut oil,’ one said.

‘Bay rum and cantharides,’ another said.

A tea-planter from Assam called Unsworth said, ‘Take my word for it, old man, you’ve got to stimulate the circulation in the scalp.

And the way to do that is to dunk your hair in ice-cold water every morning and keep it there for five minutes.

Then dry vigorously.

You’ve got a fine head of hair at the moment, but you’ll be as bald as a coot in no time if you don’t cure that dandruff.

You do as I say, old man.’

U.N. Savory did indeed have a fine head of black hair, so why in the world should he have wanted to pretend he had dandruff when he hadn’t?

‘Thanks a lot, old man,’ U.N. Savory said.

‘I’ll give it a go. See if it works.’

‘It’ll work,’ Unsworth told him.

‘My grandmother cured her dandruff that way.’

‘Your grandmother?’ someone said.

‘Did she have dandruff?’

‘When she combed her hair’, Unsworth said, ‘it looked like it was snowing.’

For the hundredth time, I told myself that they were all totally and incurably dotty, every one of them, but I was beginning to think now that U.N. Savory might beat them all to it.

I sat there staring into my beer and trying to figure out why he should go around trying to kid everyone he had dandruff.

Three days later I had the answer.

It was early evening.

We were moving slowly through the Suez Canal and it was hotter than ever.

It was my turn to dress first for dinner.

While I showered and put on my clothes, U.N. Savory lay on his bunk staring into space.

‘It’s all yours,’ I said at last as I opened the door and went out.

‘See you upstairs.’

As usual, I seated myself at the bar and began sipping a beer.

By gosh, it was hot.

The big slowly-revolving fan in the ceiling seemed to be blowing steam out of its blades.

Sweat trickled down my neck and under my stiff butterfly collar.

I could feel the starch in the collar going soggy around the back.

The sinewy sunburnt ones around me didn’t seem to notice the heat.

I decided to go out on deck and smoke a pipe before dinner.

It would be cooler there.

I felt for my pipe.

Damnation, I had left it behind.

I stood up and made my way downstairs to the cabin and opened the door.

There was a strange man sitting in shirtsleeves on U.N. Savory’s bunk and as I stepped inside, the man gave a queer little yelp and jumped to his feet as though a cracker had gone off in the seat of his pants.



The stranger was totally bald and that is why it took me a second or two to realize that he was in fact none other than U.N. Savory himself.

It is extraordinary how hair on the head or the lack of it will completely change a person’s appearance.

U.N. Savory looked like a different man.

To start with, he looked fifteen years older, and in some subtle way he seemed also to have diminished, grown much shorter and smaller.

As I said, he was almost totally bald, and the dome of his head was as pink and shiny as a ripe peach.

He was standing up now and holding in his two hands the wig he had been about to put on as I walked in.

‘You had no right to come back!’ he shouted.

‘You said you’d finished!’ Little sparks of fury were flashing in his eyes.

‘I’m … I’m most awfully sorry,’ I stammered.

‘I forgot my pipe.’

He stood there glaring at me with that dark malevolent glint in his eye and I could see little droplets of perspiration oozing out of the pores on his bald head.

I felt very bad.

I didn’t know what to say next.

‘Just let me get my pipe and I’ll clear out,’ I mumbled.

‘Oh no you don’t!’ he shouted.

‘You’ve seen it now and you’re not leaving this room until you’ve made me a promise! You’ve got to promise me you won’t tell a soul! Promise me that!’

Behind him I could see that curious black leather ‘violin case’ lying open on his bunk,

and in it, nestling alongside each other like three large black hairy hedgehogs, lay three more wigs.

‘There’s nothing wrong with being bald,’ I said.

‘I didn’t ask for your opinion,’ he shouted.

He was still very angry.

‘I just want your promise.’

‘I won’t tell anyone,’ I said.

‘I give you my word.’

‘And you’d better keep it,’ he said.

I reached out and took hold of the pipe that was lying on my bunk.

Then I began rummaging round in various places for my tobacco pouch.

U.N. Savory sat down on the lower bunk.

‘I suppose you think I’m crazy,’ he said.

Suddenly all the bark had gone out of his voice.

I said nothing.

I could think of nothing to say.

‘You do, don’t you?’ he said.

‘You think I’m crazy.’

‘Not at all,’ I answered.

‘A man can do as he likes.’

‘I’ll bet you think it’s just vanity,’ he said.

‘But it’s not vanity.

It’s nothing to do with vanity.’

‘It’s OK,’ I said.

‘Really it is.’

‘It’s business,’ he said.

‘I do it purely for business reasons.

I work in Amritsar, in the Punjab.

That is the homeland of the Sikhs.

To a Sikh, hair is a sort of religion.

A Sikh never cuts his hair.

He either rolls it up on the top of his head or in a turban.

A Sikh doesn’t respect a bald man.’

‘In that case I think it’s very clever of you to wear a wig,’ I said.

I had to live in this cabin with U.N. Savory for several days yet and I didn’t want a row.

‘It’s quite brilliant,’ I added.

‘Do you honestly think so?’ he said, melting.

‘It’s a stroke of genius.’

‘I go to a lot of trouble to convince all those Sikh wallahs it’s my own hair,’ he went on.

‘You mean the dandruff bit?’

‘You saw it, then?’

‘Of course I saw it. It was brilliant.’

‘It’s just one of my little ruses,’ he said.

He was getting just a trifle smug now.

‘No one’s going to suspect me of wearing a wig if I’ve got dandruff, are they?’

‘Certainly not. It’s quite brilliant. But why bother doing it here? There aren’t any Sikhs on this ship.’

‘You never know,’ he said darkly.

‘You never can tell who might be lurking around the corner.’

The man was as potty as a pilchard.

‘I see you have more than one,’ I said, pointing to the black leather case.

‘One’s no good,’ he said, ‘not if you’re going to do it properly like me.

I always carry four, and they’re all slightly different.

You are forgetting that hair grows, old man, aren’t you? Each one of these is longer than the other.

I put on a longer one every week.’

‘What happens after you’ve worn the longest one and you can’t go any further?’ I asked.

‘Ah,’ he said.

‘That’s the clincher.’

‘I don’t quite follow you.’

‘I simply say, “Does anyone know of a good barber round here?” And the next day I start all over again with the shortest one.’

‘But you said Sikhs didn’t approve of cutting hair.’

‘I only do that with Europeans,’ he said.

I stared at him.

The man was stark raving barmy.

I felt I would go barmy myself if I went on talking to him much longer.

I edged towards the door.

‘I think you’re amazing,’ I said.

‘You’re quite brilliant.

And don’t worry about a thing.

My lips are sealed.’

‘Thanks old man,’ U.N. Savory said.

‘Good lad.’

I flew out of the cabin and shut the door.

And that is the story of U.N. Savory.

You don’t believe it?

Listen, I could hardly believe it myself as I staggered upstairs to the bar.

I kept my promise though.

I told no one.

Today it no longer matters.

The man was at least thirty years older than me, so by now his soul is at rest and his wigs are probably being used by his nephews and nieces for playing charades.



SS Mantola, 4 October 1938



Dear Mama, We’re now in the Red Sea, and it is hot.

The wind is behind us and going at exactly the same speed as the boat so there is not a breath of air on board.

Three times they have turned the ship round against the wind to get some air into the cabins and into the engine room.

Fans merely blow hot air into your face.





The deck is strewn with a lot of limp wet things for all the world like a lot of wet towels steaming over the kitchen boiler.

They just smoke cigarettes & shout, ‘Boy – another iced lager.’





I don’t feel the heat much – probably because I’m thin.

In fact as soon as I’ve finished this letter I’m going off to have a vigorous game of deck tennis with another thin man – a government vet called Hammond.

We play with our shirts off, throwing the coit as hard as we can – & when we have to stop for fear of drowning in our own sweat we just jump into the swimming bath.





Dar es Salaam




The temperature in the shade was around 120ºF on board the SS Mantola as she crept southwards down the Red Sea towards Port Sudan.

The breeze was behind us and it blew at exactly the same speed as the ship.

There was, therefore, no movement of air at all on board.

Three times during the first day they turned the ship around and sailed against the wind to blow some air through the port-holes and over the decks.

This made little difference and even the sinewy sunburnt gophers and their tough bony little wives became silent and exhausted.

Like me, they sprawled in deck-chairs under the awning, gasping for breath

while the sweat ran down their faces and necks and arms and dripped from their elbows on to the wooden deck.

It was even too hot to read.

During the second day in the Red Sea, the Mantola passed very close to an Italian ship which, like us, was going south.

She wasn’t more than 200 yards away from us and her decks were crowded with women!

There must have been several thousand of them all over the ship and not a man in sight.

I couldn’t believe my eyes.

‘What’s going on?’ I asked one of the ship’s officers, who was standing near me on the rail.

‘Why all the girls?’

‘They’re for the Italian soldiers,’ he said.

‘What Italian soldiers?’

‘The ones in Abyssinia,’ he said.

‘Mussolini is trying to conquer Abyssinia and he’s got a hundred thousand troops in there.

Now they are shipping out Italian girls to keep the soldiers happy.’

‘You’re pulling my leg.’

‘They’re going out in boatloads,’ the officer said.

‘One girl for every soldier in the ranks, two for each Colonel and three for a General.’

‘Be serious,’ I said.

‘They really are for the soldiers,’ he said.

‘It is such a rotten pointless war and the soldiers all hate it and they are fed up with massacring the wretched Abyssinians.

So Mussolini is sending out thousands of girls to boost their morale.’

I waved to the girls on the other ship and about 2,000 of them waved back at me.

They seemed very cheerful.

I wondered how long they would be feeling that way.



At last the Mantola reached Mombasa, and there I was met by a man from the Shell Company

who told me I was to proceed at once down the coast to Dar es Salaam, in Tanganyika (now Tanzania).

‘It will take you a day and a night to get there,’ he said, ‘and you travel on a little coastal vessel called the Dumra.

Here’s your ticket.’

I transferred to the Dumra and it sailed the same day.

That evening we called in at Zanzibar where the air was filled with the amazing spicy-sweet scent of cloves,

and I stood by the rail gazing at the old Arab town and thinking

what a lucky young fellow I was to be seeing all these marvellous places free of charge and with a good job at the end of it all.

We left Zanzibar at midnight and I went to bed in my tiny cabin knowing that tomorrow would be journey’s end.

When I woke up the next morning the ship’s engines had stopped.

I jumped out of my bunk and peered through the port-hole.

This was my first glimpse of Dar es Salaam and I have never forgotten it.

We were anchored out in the middle of a vast rippling blue-black lagoon and all around the rim of the lagoon there were pale-yellow sandy beaches,

almost white, and breakers were running up on to the sand, and coconut palms with their little green leafy hats were growing on the beaches,

and there were casuarina trees, immensely tall and breathtakingly beautiful with their delicate grey-green foliage.

And then behind the casuarinas was what seemed to me like a jungle,

a great tangle of tremendous dark-green trees that were full of shadows and almost certainly teeming,

so I told myself, with rhinos and lions and all manner of vicious beasts.

Over to one side lay the tiny town of Dar es Salaam, the houses white and yellow and pink,

and among the houses I could see a narrow church steeple and a domed mosque and along the waterfront there was a line of acacia trees splashed with scarlet flowers.

A fleet of canoes was rowing out to take us ashore and the black-skinned rowers were chanting weird songs in time with their rowing.



The whole of that amazing tropical scene through the port-hole has been photographed on my mind ever since.

To me it was all wonderful, beautiful and exciting.

And so it remained for the rest of my time in Tanganyika.

I loved it all.

There were no furled umbrellas, no bowler hats, no sombre grey suits and I never once had to get on a train or a bus.

Only three young Englishmen ran the Shell Company in the whole of that vast territory, and I was the youngest and the junior.

When we were not ‘on the road’, we lived in the splendid large Shell Company house perched on the top of the cliffs outside Dar es Salaam,

and we were treated like princes.

Our domestic staff consisted of a male native cook affectionately called Piggy because the Swahili for cook is mpishi.

There was a shamba-boy or gardener called Salimu and a personal ‘boy’ for each of us.

Your boy was really a kind of valet and jack of all trades.

He was expert at sewing and mending and washing and ironing and polishing and making sure

there weren’t scorpions in your mosquito boots before you put them on, and he became your friend.

He looked after nobody else but you and there was nothing he did not know about your life and your habits.

In return, you looked after him and his wives (never less than two) and his children who lived in their own quarters at the back of the house.



My boy was called Mdisho.

He was a Mwanumwezi tribesman, which meant a lot out there because the Mwanumwezi was the only tribe who had ever defeated the gigantic Masai in battle.

Mdisho was tall and graceful and soft-spoken, and his loyalty to me, his young white English master, was absolute.

I hope, and I believe, that I was equally loyal to him.

The first thing you had to do when you came to work in Dar es Salaam was to learn Swahili, otherwise you could not communicate either with your own boy or with any other native of the country because none of them spoke a word of English.

In those benighted days of Empire it was considered impertinent for a black man to understand English, let alone to speak it.

The result was that none of them made any effort to learn our language, so we had to learn theirs instead.

Swahili is a relatively simple language, and with the help of a Swahili-English dictionary and a grammar book,

plus some hard work in the evenings, you could become pretty fluent in a couple of months.

Then you took an exam and if you passed it, the Shell Company gave you a bonus of a hundred pounds,

which was a lot of money in those days when a case of whisky cost only twelve pounds.



Sometimes I would have to go on safari upcountry and Mdisho always came with me.

We would take the Shell station-wagon and be gone for a month, driving all over Tanganyika on dirt roads that were covered with millions of tiny close-together ruts.

Driving over those ruts in a station-wagon felt as though you were riding on top of a gigantic vibrator.

We would drive far west to the edge of Lake Tanganyika in central Africa and on down south to the borders of Nyasaland,

and after that we would head east towards Mozambique, and the purpose of these trips was to visit our Shell customers.

These customers ran diamond mines and gold mines and sisal plantations and cotton plantations and goodness knows what else besides,

and my job was to keep their machinery supplied with the proper grades of lubricating oil and fuel oil.

Not a great deal of intelligence or imagination was required, but by gum you needed to be fit and tough.

I loved that life.

We saw giraffe standing unafraid right beside the road nibbling the tops of the trees.

We saw plenty of elephant and hippo and zebra and antelope and very occasionally a pride of lions.

The only creatures I was frightened of were the snakes.

We used often to see a big one gliding across the dirt road ahead of the car, and the golden rule was never to accelerate

and try to run it over, especially if the roof of the car was open, as ours often was.

If you hit a snake at speed, the front wheel can flip it up into the air and there is a danger of it landing in your lap.

I can think of nothing worse than that.

The really bad snake in Tanganyika is the black mamba.

It is the only one that has no fear of man and will deliberately attack him on sight.

If it bites you, you are a gonner.

One morning I was shaving myself in the bathroom of our Dar es Salaam house, and as I lathered my face I was absent-mindedly gazing out of the window into the garden.

I was watching Salimu, our shamba-boy, as he slowly and methodically raked the gravel on the front drive.

Then I saw the snake.

It was six feet long and thick as my arm and quite black.

It was a mamba all right and there was no doubt that it had seen Salimu and was gliding fast over the gravel straight towards him.

I flung myself toward the open window and yelled in Swahili, ‘Salimu! Salimu! Angalia nyoka kubwa! Nyuma wewe! Upesi upesi!’,

in other words, ‘Salimu! Salimu! Beware huge snake! Behind you! Quickly quickly!’

The mamba was moving over the gravel at the speed of a running man and when Salimu turned and saw it, it could not have been more than fifteen paces away from him.

There was nothing more I could do.

There was not much Salimu could do either.

He knew it was useless to run because a mamba at full speed could travel as fast as a galloping horse.

And he certainly knew it was a mamba.

Every native in Tanganyika knew what a mamba looked like and what to expect from it.

It would reach him in another five seconds.

I leant out of the window and held my breath.

Salimu swung round and faced the snake.

I saw him go into a crouch.

He crouched very low with one leg behind the other like a runner about to start a hundred yard sprint, and he was holding the long rake out in front of him.

He raised it, but no higher than his shoulder, and he stood there for those long four or five seconds absolutely motionless, watching the great black deadly snake as it glided so quickly over the gravel towards him.

Its small triangular snake’s head was raised up in the air, and I could hear the soft rustling of the gravel as the body slid over the loose stones.

I have the whole nightmarish picture of that scene still before my eyes – the morning sunshine on the garden, the massive baobab tree in the background,

Salimu in his old khaki shorts and shirt and bare feet standing brave and absolutely still with the upraised rake in his hands,

and to one side the long black snake gliding over the gravel straight towards him with its small poisonous head held high and ready to strike.

Salimu waited.

He never moved or made a sound during the time it took the snake to reach him.

He waited until the very last moment when the mamba was not more than five feet away and then wham! Salimu struck first.

He brought the metal prongs of the rake down hard right on to the middle of the mamba’s back and he held the rake there with all his weight,

leaning forward now and jumping up and down to put more weight on the fork in an effort to pin the snake to the ground.

I saw the blood spurt where the prongs had gone right into the snake’s body and then I rushed downstairs absolutely naked,

grabbing a golf club as I went through the hall, and outside on the drive Salimu was still there pressing with both hands on the rake

and the great snake was writhing and twisting and throwing itself about, and I shouted to Salimu in Swahili, ‘What shall I do?’

‘It is all right now, bwana!’ he shouted back.

‘I have broken its back and it cannot travel forward any more! Stand away, bwana! Stand well away and leave it to me!’

Salimu lifted the rake and jumped away and the snake went on writhing and twisting but it was quite unable to travel in any direction.

The boy went forward and hit it accurately and very hard on the head with the metal end of the rake and suddenly the snake stopped moving.

Salimu let out a great sigh and passed a hand over his forehead.

Then he looked at me and smiled.

‘Asanti, bwana,’ he said, ‘asanti sana,’ which simply means, ‘Thank you, bwana.

Thank you very much.’

It isn’t often one gets the chance to save a person’s life.

It gave me a good feeling for the rest of the day, and from then on, every time I saw Salimu, the good feeling would come back to me.



Dar es Salaam, 19 March 1939



Dear Mama,



If a war breaks out you’ve jolly well got to go to Tenby otherwise you’ll be bombed.

Don’t forget, you’ve got to go if war breaks out …





Simba

About a month after the black mamba incident,

I set out on a safari upcountry in the old Shell station-wagon with Mdisho and our first stop was the small town of Bagomoyo.

I mention this only because the name of the Indian trader I had to go and see in Bagomoyo was so wonderful I have never been able to get it out of my mind.

He was a tiny little man with an immense low-slung protuberant belly of the kind that women have when they are eight and a half months pregnant,

and he carried this great ball in front of him very proudly, as if it were a special medal or a coat of arms.

He called himself Mister Shankerbai Ganderbai, and across the top of his business notepaper was printed in red capital letters

the full title he had conferred upon himself, MISTER SHANKERBAI GANDERBAI OF BAGOMOYO, SELLER OF DECORTICATORS.

A decorticator is a huge clanking piece of machinery that converts the leaves of the sisal plant into fibres for making rope,

and if you wanted to buy one, the man to go and see was Mister Shankerbai Ganderbai of Bagomoyo.

After three more days of dusty travelling and visiting customers, Mdisho and I came to the town of Tabora.

Tabora is some 450 miles inland from Dar es Salaam, and in 1939 it was not much of a town,

just a scattering of houses and a few streets where the Indian traders had their shops.

But because by Tanganyikan standards it was a sizeable place, it was honoured by the presence of a British District Officer.

The District Officers in Tanganyika were a breed I admired.

Admittedly they were sunburnt and sinewy, but they were not gophers.

They were all university graduates with good degrees, and in their lonely outposts they had to be all things to all men.

They were the judges whose decisions settled both tribal and personal disputes.

They were the advisers to tribal chiefs.

They were often the givers of medicines and the saviours of the sick.

They administered their own vast districts by keeping law and order under the most difficult circumstances.

And wherever there was a District Officer, the Shell man on safari was welcome to stay the night at his house.

The DO in Tabora was called Robert Sanford, a man in his early thirties who had a wife and three very small children, a boy of six, a girl of four and a baby.

That evening I was sitting on the veranda having a sundowner with Robert Sanford and his wife Mary,

while two of the children were playing out on the grass in front of the house under the watchful eye of their black nurse.

The heat of the day was becoming less intense as the sun went down, and the first whisky and soda was tasting good.

‘So what’s been going on in Dar?’ Robert Sanford asked me.

‘Anything exciting?’

I told him about the black mamba and Salimu.

When I had finished, Mary Sanford said, ‘That’s the one thing I’m always frightened of in this country, those beastly snakes.’

‘Damn lucky you happened to see it behind him,’ Robert Sanford said.

‘He was certain to have been killed.’

‘We had a spitting cobra near our back door not long ago,’ Mary Sanford said.

‘Robert shot it.’

The Sanford house was on a hill outside the town.

It was a white wooden two-storey building with a roof of green tiles.

The eaves of the house projected far out beyond the walls to provide extra shade, and this gave the building a sort of Japanese pagoda appearance.

The surrounding countryside was to me a very pleasant sight.

It was a vast brown plain with many quite large knolls and hummocks dotted all over it, and although the plain itself was mostly burnt-up scrubland,

the hills were covered with all sorts of huge jungle trees, and their dense foliage made little emerald-green dots all over the plain.

On the burnt-up plain itself there grew nothing but those bare spiky thorn trees that you find all over East Africa,

and there were about six huge vultures sitting quite motionless on every thorn tree in sight.

The vultures were brown with curved orange beaks and orange feet,

and they spent their whole lives sitting and watching and waiting for some animal to die so they could pick its bones.

‘Do you like this sort of life?’ I said to Robert Sanford.

‘I love the freedom,’ he said.

‘I administer about two thousand square miles of territory and I can go where I want and do more or less exactly as I please.

That part of it is marvellous.

But I do miss the company of other white men.

There aren’t many even moderately intelligent Europeans in the town.’

We sat there watching the sun go down behind the flat brown plain that was covered with thorn trees,

and we could see the sinister vultures waiting like feathered undertakers for death to come along and give them something to work on.



‘Keep the children a bit closer to the house!’ Mary Sanford called out to the nurse.

‘Bring them closer, please!’

Robert Sanford said, ‘My mother sent me out Beethoven’s Third Symphony from England last week.

HMV, two records, four sides in all, Toscanini conducting.

I’m using a thorn needle instead of a steel one so as not to wear out the grooves.

It seems to work.’

‘Don’t you find the records warp a lot out here?’ I asked.

‘I keep them lying flat with a pile of books on top of them,’ he said.

‘What I’m terrified of is dropping one and breaking it.’

The sun had gone down now and a lovely soft light was spreading over the landscape.

I could see a group of zebra grazing among the thorn trees about half a mile away.

Robert Sanford was also watching the zebras.

‘I keep wondering,’ he said, ‘if it wouldn’t be possible to catch a young zebra and break it in for riding, just like a horse.

After all, they are only wild horses with stripes on.’

‘Has anyone ever tried?’ I asked.

‘Not that I know,’ he said.

‘Mary’s a good rider.

What do you think, darling? How would you like to have a private zebra to ride on?’

‘It might be fun,’ she said.

Even though she had a bit of a jaw, she was a handsome woman.

I didn’t mind the jaw.

The shape of it gave her the look of a fighter.

‘Perhaps we could cross one with a horse,’ Robert Sanford said, ‘and call it a zorse.’

‘Or a hebra,’ Mary Sanford said.

‘Right,’ her husband said, smiling.

‘Shall we try it?’ Mary Sanford said.

‘It would be rather splendid to have a baby zorse or hebra.

Oh darling, shall we try it?’

‘The children could ride it,’ he said.

‘A black zorse with white stripes all over it.’

‘Please can we play your Beethoven after supper?’ I said.

‘Absolutely,’ Robert Sanford said.

‘I’ll put the gramophone out here on the veranda and then those tremendous chords can go booming out through the night over the plain.

It’s terrific.

The only trouble is I have to wind the thing up twice for each side.’

‘I’ll wind it for you,’ I said.

Suddenly, the voice of a man yelling in Swahili exploded into the quiet of the evening.

It was my boy, Mdisho.

‘Bwana! Bwana! Bwana!’ he was yelling from somewhere behind the house.

‘Simba, bwana! Simba! Simba!’

Simba is Swahili for lion.

All three of us leapt to our feet, and the next moment Mdisho came tearing round the corner of the house yelling at us in Swahili,

‘Come quick, bwana! Come quick! Come quick! A huge lion is eating the wife of the cook!’

That sounds pretty funny when you put it on paper back here in England, but to us, standing on a veranda in the middle of East Africa, it was not funny at all.

Robert Sanford flew into the house and came out again in five seconds flat holding a powerful rifle and ramming a cartridge into the breech.

‘Get those children indoors!’ he shouted to his wife as he ran down off the veranda with me behind him.

Mdisho was dancing about and pointing towards the back of the house and yelling in Swahili,

‘The lion has taken the wife of the cook and the lion is eating her and the cook is chasing the lion and trying to save his wife!’

The servants lived in a series of low whitewashed outbuildings at the back of the house,

and as we came running round the corner we saw four or five house-boys leaping about and pointing and shrieking,

‘Simba! Simba! Simba!’ The boys were all clothed in spotless white cotton robes that looked like long night-shirts,

and each had a fine scarlet tarboosh on his head.

The tarboosh is a sort of top-hat without a brim, and there is often a black tassel on it.

The women had come out of their huts as well and were standing in a separate group, silent, immobile and staring.

‘Where is it?’ Robert Sanford shouted, but he had no need to ask,

for we very quickly spotted the massive sandy-coloured lion not more than eighty or ninety yards off and trotting away from the house.

He had a fine bushy collar of fur around his neck, and in his jaws he was holding the wife of the cook.

The lion had the woman by the waist so that her head and arms hung down on one side and her legs on the other,

and I could see that she was wearing a red and white spotted dress.

The lion, so startlingly close, was loping away from us in the calmest possible manner with a slow, long-striding, springy lope,

and behind the lion, not more than the length of a tennis court behind, ran the cook himself in his white cotton robe and with his red hat on his head,

running most bravely and waving his arms like a whirlwind, leaping, clapping his hands, screaming, shouting, shouting, shouting,

‘Simba! Simba! Simba! Simba! Let go of my wife! Let go of my wife!’

Oh, it was a scene of great tragedy and comedy both mixed up together, and now Robert Sanford was running full speed after the cook who was running after the lion.

He was holding his rifle in both hands and shouting to the cook, ‘Pingo! Pingo! Get out of the way, Pingo!

Lie down on the ground so I can shoot the simba! You are in my way! You are in my way, Pingo!’

But the cook ignored him and kept on running, and the lion ignored everybody, not altering his pace at all but continuing to lope along with slow springy strides

and with the head held high and carrying the woman proudly in his jaws, rather like a dog who is trotting off with a good bone.

Both the cook and Robert Sanford were travelling faster than the lion who really didn’t seem to care about his pursuers at all.

And as for me, I didn’t know what to do to help them so I ran after Robert Sanford.

It was an awkward situation because there was no way that Robert Sanford could take a shot at the lion without risking a hit on the cook’s wife,

let alone on the cook himself who was still right in his line of fire.

The lion was heading for one of those hillocks that was densely covered with jungle trees and we all knew that once he got in there,

we would never be able to get at him.

The incredibly brave cook was actually catching up on the lion and was now not more than ten yards behind him,

and Robert Sanford was thirty or forty yards behind the cook.

‘Ayee!’ the cook was shouting.

‘Simba! Simba! Simba! Let go my wife! I am coming after you, simba!’

Then Robert Sanford stopped and raised his rifle and took aim, and I thought surely he is not risking a shot at a moving lion when it’s got a woman in its jaws.

There was an almighty crack as the big gun went off and I saw a spurt of dust just ahead of the lion.

The lion stopped dead and turned his head, still holding the woman in his jaws.

He saw the arm-waving shouting cook and he saw Robert Sanford and he saw me and he had certainly heard the rifle shot and seen the spurt of dust.

He must have thought an army was coming after him because instantaneously he dropped the cook’s wife on to the ground and broke for cover.

I have never seen anything accelerate so fast from a standing start.

With great leaping bounding strides he was in among the jungle trees on the hillock before Robert Sanford could ram another cartridge into his gun.

The cook reached the wife first, then Robert Sanford, then me.

I couldn’t believe what I saw.

I was certain that the grip of those terrible jaws would have ripped the woman’s waist and stomach almost in two,

but there she was sitting up on the ground and smiling at the cook, her husband.

‘Where are you hurt?’ shouted Robert Sanford, rushing up.

The cook’s wife looked up at him and kept smiling, and she said in Swahili, ‘That old lion he couldn’t scare me.

I just lay there in his mouth pretending I was dead and he didn’t even bite through my clothes.’

She stood up and smoothed down her red and white spotted dress which was wet with the lion’s saliva,

and the cook embraced her and the two of them did a little dance of joy in the twilight out there on the great brown African plain.

Robert Sanford just stood there gaping at the cook’s wife.

So, for that matter, did I.

‘Are you absolutely sure the simba didn’t hurt you?’ he asked her.

‘Did not his teeth go into your body?’

‘No, bwana,’ the woman said, laughing.

‘He carried me as gently as if I had been one of his own cubs.

But now I shall have to wash my dress.’

We walked slowly back to the group of astonished onlookers.

‘Tonight’, Robert Sanford said, addressing them all, ‘nobody is to go far from the house, you understand me?’

‘Yes, bwana,’ they said.

‘Yes, yes, we understand you.’

‘That old simba is hiding over there in the wood and he may come back,’ Robert Sanford said.

‘So be very careful.

And Pingo, please continue to cook our dinner.

I am getting hungry.’

The cook ran into the kitchen, clapping his hands and leaping for joy.

We walked over to where Mary Sanford was standing.

She had come round to the back of the house soon after us and had witnessed the whole scene.

The three of us then returned to the veranda and fresh drinks were poured.
