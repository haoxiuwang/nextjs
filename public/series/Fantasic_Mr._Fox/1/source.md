They were not men who liked to give anything away.
他们不是那种喜欢放弃一切的人。
Less still did they like anything to be stolen from them.
他们更不喜欢别人从他们身上偷走任何东西。
So every night each of them would take his shotgun and hide in a dark place somewhere on his own farm, hoping to catch the robber.

But Mr Fox was too clever for them.
但福克斯先生对他们来说太聪明了。
He always approached a farm with the wind blowing in his face,
他总是在风吹着他的脸的时候靠近一个农场,
and this meant that if any man were lurking in the shadows ahead,
这意味着如果有人潜伏在前方的阴影中,
the wind would carry the smell of that man to Mr Fox’s nose from far away.
风会把那个人的气味从很远的地方吹到福克斯先生的鼻子上。
Thus, if Mr Boggis was hiding behind his Chicken House Number One,

你知道他们三个都在等你
‘Don’t you worry about me,’ said Mr Fox.

‘I’ll see you later.’

But Mr Fox would not have been quite so cocky had he known exactly where the three farmers were waiting at that moment.
但是，如果福克斯先生知道那三个农民此刻正在等待的确切位置，他就不会如此自大了。
They were just outside the entrance to the hole, each one crouching behind a tree with his gun loaded.

He found none, and he was just about to go trotting forward into the wood when he heard or thought he heard a tiny noise,

It was coming up and up , Great heavens! It was the barrel of a gun! Quick as a whip,

The tall skinny Bean and dwarfish pot-bellied Bunce were driving their machines like maniacs,
瘦高的比恩和矮小的大腹便便的邦斯像疯子一样驾驶着他们的机器,
racing the motors and making the shovels dig at a terrific speed.
加速马达，让铲子以惊人的速度挖掘。
The fat Boggis was hopping about like a dervish and shouting, ‘Faster! Faster!’
胖博吉斯像个苦行僧一样跳来跳去，大喊着: “快点! 快点!”
By five o’clock in the afternoon this is what had happened to the hill:
下午五点钟，山上发生了这样的事:
The hole the machines had dug was like the crater of a volcano.
机器人挖的洞就像火山口。
It was such an extraordinary sight that crowds of people came rushing out from the surrounding villages to have a look.
这是一个非同寻常的景象，成群的人从周围的村庄涌出来看。
They stood on the edge of the crater and stared down at Boggis and Bunce and Bean.
他们站在火山口的边缘，俯视着 Boggis、邦斯和比恩。
‘Hey there, Boggis! What’s going on?’
你好，博吉斯，怎么了
‘We’re after a fox!’
我们在追一只狐狸
‘You must be mad!’
你一定是疯了
The people jeered and laughed.
人们又嘲笑又笑。
But this only made the three farmers more furious and more obstinate and more determined than ever not to give up until they had caught the fox.
但这只会让三个农民更加愤怒，更加固执，更加坚决，不抓到狐狸决不罢休。
Part 7, ‘We’ll Never Let Him Go’
第七部分，“我们永远不会让他走”
At six o’clock in the evening, Bean switched off the motor of his tractor and climbed down from the driver’s seat.
傍晚六点，比恩关掉拖拉机的发动机，从驾驶座上爬下来。
Bunce did the same.
邦斯也是。
Both men had had enough.
两个人都受够了。
They were tired and stiff from driving the tractors all day.
因为整天开着拖拉机，他们又累又僵硬。
They were also hungry.
他们也饿了。
Slowly they walked over to the small fox’s hole in the bottom of the huge crater.
他们慢慢地走到巨坑底部的小狐狸洞前。
Bean’s face was purple with rage.
比恩气得脸色发紫。
Bunce was cursing the fox with dirty words that cannot be printed.
邦斯用无法印刷的脏话咒骂狐狸。
Boggis came waddling up.
伯吉斯摇摇晃晃地走过来。
‘Dang and blast that filthy stinking fox!’ he said.
“该死的，炸死那只肮脏的臭狐狸!”他说。
‘What the heck do we do now?’
我们现在该怎么办
‘I’ll tell you what we don’t do,’ Bean said.
“我来告诉你我们不做什么,”比恩说。
‘We don’t let him go!’
我们不会让他走的
‘We’ll never let him go!’ Bunce declared.
“我们绝不会让他走的!”邦斯宣布。
‘Never never never!’ cried Boggis.
“永远永远永远!”博吉斯喊道。
‘Did you hear that, Mr Fox!’ yelled Bean, bending low and shouting down the hole.
“你听到了吗，狐狸先生!”比恩大声喊道，弯下腰，冲着洞里喊道。
‘It’s not over yet, Mr Fox! We’re not going home till we’ve strung you up dead as a dingbat!’
事情还没有结束，福克斯先生! 在我们把你吊死之前，我们是不会回家的
Whereupon the three men all shook hands with one another and swore a solemn oath that they would not go back to their farms until the fox was caught.
于是三个人相互握手，庄严地发誓，除非抓到狐狸，否则他们不会回到自己的农场。
‘What’s the next move?’ asked Bunce, the pot-bellied dwarf.
“下一步怎么办?”大腹便便的矮人邦斯问道。
‘We’re sending you down the hole to fetch him up,’ said Bean.
“我们派你到洞里去接他上来,”比恩说。
‘Down you go, you miserable midget!’
下去吧，你这个可怜的侏儒
‘Not me!’ screamed Bunce, running away.
“不是我!”邦斯尖叫着跑开了。
Bean made a sickly smile.
比恩露出一个病态的微笑。
When he smiled you saw his scarlet gums.
当他微笑的时候，你看到了他猩红色的牙龈。
You saw more gums than teeth.
你看到的牙龈比牙齿还多。
‘Then there’s only one thing to do,’ he said.
他说，那么只有一件事可以做了。
‘We starve him out.
我们饿死他。
We camp here day and night watching the hole.
我们日夜在这里扎营，监视这个洞。
He’ll come out in the end.
他最终会出来的。
He’ll have to.’
他必须这么做。”
So Boggis and Bunce and Bean sent messages down to their farms asking for tents, sleeping-bags and supper.
于是，博吉斯、邦斯和比恩向他们的农场发出信息，要求提供帐篷、睡袋和晚餐。
Part 8, The Foxes Begin to Starve
第八部分，狐狸开始挨饿
That evening three tents were put up in the crater on the hill – one for Boggis, one for Bunce and one for Bean.
那天晚上，在山上的火山口搭起了三顶帐篷——一顶给博吉斯，一顶给邦斯，一顶给比恩。
The tents surrounded Mr Fox’s hole.
帐篷围住了福克斯先生的洞。
And the three farmers sat outside their tents eating their supper.
三个农民坐在帐篷外吃晚饭。
Boggis had three boiled chickens smothered in dumplings,
伯吉斯吃了三只煮鸡裹在饺子里,
Bunce had six doughnuts filled with disgusting goose-liver paste, and Bean had two gallons of cider.
邦斯吃了六个装满恶心鹅肝酱的甜甜圈比恩吃了两加仑苹果酒。
All three of them kept their guns beside them.
他们三个人都把枪放在身边。
Boggis picked up a steaming chicken and held it close to the fox’s hole.
博吉斯拿起一只热气腾腾的鸡，把它放在狐狸的洞边。
‘Can you smell this, Mr Fox?’ he shouted.
“你闻到了吗，狐狸先生?”他喊道。
‘Lovely tender chicken! Why don’t you come up and get it?’
“可爱的嫩鸡! 你为什么不上来拿呢?”
The rich scent of chicken wafted down the tunnel to where the foxes were crouching.
浓郁的鸡肉香味沿着隧道飘向狐狸们蹲伏的地方。
‘Oh, Dad,’ said one of the Small Foxes, ‘couldn’t we just sneak up and snatch it out of his hand?’
“噢，爸爸,”一只小狐狸说，“我们能不能偷偷地从他手里抢过来?”
‘Don’t you dare!’ said Mrs Fox.
“你敢!”福克斯太太说。
‘That’s just what they want you to do.’
这就是他们想让你做的
‘But we’re so hungry!’ they cried.
“可是我们太饿了!”他们喊道。
‘How long will it be till we get something to eat?’
还要多久我们才能吃到东西
Their mother didn’t answer them.
他们的母亲没有回答。
Nor did their father.
他们的父亲也不知道。
There was no answer to give.
没有答案。
As darkness fell, Bunce and Bean switched on the powerful headlamps of the two tractors and shone them on to the hole.
夜幕降临时，邦斯和比恩打开两辆拖拉机的强大前灯，把它们照到洞里。
‘Now,’ said Bean, ‘we’ll take it in turn to keep watch.
“现在,”比恩说，“我们轮流把风。
One watches while two sleep, and so on all through the night.’
一个人看着两个人睡觉，等等，一整晚都是这样。”
Boggis said, ‘What if the fox digs a hole right through the hill and comes out on the other side? You didn’t think of that one, did you?’
博吉斯说: “如果狐狸在山上挖了一个洞，然后从另一边出来怎么办?”？你没想到吧？’
‘Of course I did,’ said Bean, pretending he had.
“我当然知道,”比恩说，假装知道。
‘Go on, then, tell us the answer,’ said Boggis.
“那么，继续，告诉我们答案,”博吉斯说。
Bean picked something small and black out of his ear and flicked it away.
比恩从耳朵里掏出一个又小又黑的东西，弹开了。
‘How many men have you got working on your farm?’ he asked.
“你的农场有多少人在干活?”他问。
‘Thirty-five,’ Boggis said.
“三十五,”博吉斯说。
‘I’ve got thirty-six,’ Bunce said.
“我有36个,”邦斯说。
‘And I’ve got thirty-seven,’ Bean said.
“我有三十七个,”比恩说。
‘That makes one hundred and eight men altogether.
总共一百零八个人。
We must order them to surround the hill.
我们必须命令他们包围小山。
Each man will have a gun and a flashlight.
每个人都有枪和手电筒。
There will be no escape then for Mr Fox.’
那么福克斯先生就无路可逃了
So the order went down to the farms, and that night one hundred and eight men formed a tight ring around the bottom of the hill.
于是命令下达到农场，那天晚上一百零八个人在山脚下形成了一个紧密的包围圈。
They were armed with sticks and guns and hatchets and pistols and all sorts of other horrible weapons.
他们手持棍棒、枪支、斧头、手枪和其他各种可怕的武器。
This made it quite impossible for a fox or indeed for any other animal to escape from the hill.
这使得狐狸或其他任何动物都不可能从山上逃走。
The next day, the watching and waiting went on.
第二天，观察和等待继续进行。
Boggis and Bunce and Bean sat upon small stools, staring at the fox’s hole.
博吉斯、邦斯和比恩坐在小凳子上，盯着狐狸的洞。
They didn’t talk much.
他们不怎么说话。
They just sat there with their guns on their laps.
他们只是坐在那里，把枪放在膝盖上。
Every so often, Mr Fox would creep a little closer towards the mouth of the tunnel and take a sniff.
每隔一段时间，福克斯先生就会悄悄地靠近隧道口，嗅一嗅。
Then he would creep back again and say, ‘They’re still there.’
然后他又会悄悄地回来说，‘他们还在那里。’
‘Are you quite sure?’ Mrs Fox would ask.
“你确定吗?”福克斯太太会问。
‘Positive,’ said Mr Fox.
“确定,”福克斯先生说。
‘I can smell that man Bean a mile away.
我在一英里外就能闻到那个男人的味道。
He stinks.’
他臭死了
Part 9, Mr Fox Has a Plan
第九部分，福克斯先生有一个计划
For three days and three nights this waiting-game went on.
这场等待游戏持续了三天三夜。
‘How long can a fox go without food or water?’ Boggis asked on the third day.
“狐狸没有食物和水能活多久?”博吉斯在第三天问道。
‘Not much longer now,’ Bean told him.
“不会太久了,”比恩告诉他。
‘He’ll make a run for it soon.
他很快就会逃跑。
He’ll have to.’
他必须这么做。”
Bean was right.
比恩说得对。
Down in the tunnel the foxes were slowly but surely starving to death.
在隧道里，狐狸们慢慢地，但肯定是饿死了。
‘If only we could have just a tiny sip of water,’ said one of the Small Foxes.
“要是我们能喝一小口水就好了,”一只小狐狸说。
‘Oh, Dad, can’t you do something?’
爸爸，你就不能做点什么吗
‘Couldn’t we make a dash for it, Dad? We’d have a little bit of a chance, wouldn’t we?’
爸爸，我们能不能冲过去? 我们还有一点点机会，不是吗
‘No chance at all,’ snapped Mrs Fox.

I’d sooner you stay down here and die in peace.’

Mr Fox had not spoken for a long time.
福克斯先生已经很长时间没有说话了。
He had been sitting quite still, his eyes closed, not even hearing what the others were saying.

Mrs Fox knew that he was trying desperately to think of a way out.
福克斯太太知道他正在拼命地想办法出去。
And now, as she looked at him, she saw him stir himself and get slowly to his feet.

There was a little spark of excitement dancing in his eyes.

‘Well ,’ said Mr Fox, then he stopped and sighed and sadly shook his head.
“好吧,”福克斯先生说，然后他停下来叹了口气，伤心地摇了摇头。
He sat down again.
他又坐了下来。
‘It’s no good,’ he said.
他说，这样不好。
‘It won’t work after all.’
这根本行不通
‘Why not, Dad?’
“为什么不呢，爸爸?”
‘Because it means more digging and we aren’t any of us strong enough for that after three days and nights without food.’
因为这意味着更多的挖掘，我们中的任何一个人都没有足够的力量在三天三夜没有食物的情况下去挖掘。’
‘Yes we are, Dad!’ cried the Small Foxes, jumping up and running to their father.
“是的，爸爸!”小狐狸叫着，跳起来跑向他们的爸爸。
‘We can do it! You see if we can’t! So can you!’
我们能做到! 你看我们能不能! 你也能
Mr Fox looked at the four Small Foxes and he smiled.
福克斯先生看着四只小狐狸，笑了。
What fine children I have, he thought.

I must not let them down.

‘I , I suppose we could give it a try,’ he said.

Slowly, Mrs Fox got to her feet.

Part 10, Boggis’s Chicken House Number One
第十部分，伯吉斯的第一鸡舍
‘This time we must go in a very special direction,’ said Mr Fox, pointing sideways and downward.
“这一次我们必须朝着一个非常特别的方向前进,”福克斯先生指着旁边和下面说。
So he and his four children started to dig once again.
于是他和他的四个孩子又开始挖掘。
The work went much more slowly now.
现在工作进行得慢多了。
Yet they kept at it with great courage, and little by little the tunnel began to grow.
然而，他们仍然以极大的勇气坚持下去，隧道一点一点地开始发展起来。
‘Dad, I wish you would tell us where we are going,’ said one of the children.
“爸爸，我希望你能告诉我们要去哪里,”其中一个孩子说。
‘I dare not do that,’ said Mr Fox, ‘because this place I am hoping to get to is so marvellous that if I described it to you now you would go crazy with excitement.
“我不敢那样做,”福克斯先生说，“因为我希望到达的这个地方是如此神奇，如果我现在向你描述它，你会兴奋得发疯的。
And then, if we failed to get there (which is very possible), you would die of disappointment.
然后，如果我们没有到达那里(这是很有可能的) ，你会死于失望。
I don’t want to raise your hopes too much, my darlings.’
我不想让你们抱太大希望，亲爱的
For a long long time they kept on digging.
很长一段时间，他们一直在挖掘。
For how long they did not know, because there were no days and no nights down there in the murky tunnel.
他们不知道有多长时间，因为在黑暗的隧道里没有白天也没有黑夜。
But at last Mr Fox gave the order to stop.
但最后福克斯先生下令停止。
‘I think,’ he said, ‘we had better take a peep upstairs now and see where we are.
“我想,”他说，“我们最好现在上楼看看我们在哪儿。”。
I know where I want to be, but I can’t possibly be sure we’re anywhere near it.’
我知道我想去哪里，但我不能肯定我们是否就在附近。”
Slowly, wearily, the foxes began to slope the tunnel up towards the surface.
慢慢地、疲倦地，狐狸们开始把隧道向上斜向地面。
Up and up it went , until suddenly they came to something hard above their heads and they couldn’t go up any further.
它一直往上爬，直到突然他们遇到了头顶上的坚硬的东西，他们再也爬不上去了。
Mr Fox reached up to examine this hard thing.
福克斯先生伸手去检查这个硬东西。
‘It’s wood!’ he whispered.
“是木头!”他低声说。
‘Wooden planks!’
木板
‘What does that mean, Dad?’
那是什么意思，爸爸
‘It means, unless I am very much mistaken, that we are right underneath somebody’s house,’ whispered Mr Fox.
“这意味着，除非我大错特错，我们就在某人房子的正下方,”福克斯先生低声说。
‘Be very quiet now while I take a peek.’
现在安静点，我去看看
Carefully, Mr Fox began pushing up one of the floorboards.
福克斯先生开始小心翼翼地推起一块地板。
The board creaked most terribly and they all ducked down, waiting for something awful to happen.
董事会吱吱作响，非常可怕，他们都蹲下来，等待可怕的事情发生。
Nothing did.

So Mr Fox pushed up a second board.

He let out a shriek of excitement.

‘I’ve done it!’ he yelled.

He pulled himself up through the gap in the floor and started prancing and dancing with joy.
他从地板的缝隙中爬了起来，开始欢快地跳起舞来。
‘Come on up!’ he sang out.
“上来吧!”他大声喊道。
‘Come up and see where you are, my darlings! What a sight for a hungry fox! Hallelujah! Hooray! Hooray!’
上来看看你们在哪里，亲爱的! 对于一只饥饿的狐狸来说，这是多么美妙的景象啊! 哈利路亚! 万岁! 万岁
The four Small Foxes scrambled up out of the tunnel and what a fantastic sight it was that now met their eyes!
四只小狐狸从隧道里爬了出来，现在看到的是多么奇妙的景象啊！
They were in a huge shed and the whole place was teeming with chickens.

‘It’s exactly what I was aiming at! I hit it slap in the middle! First time!
这正是我瞄准的! 我打中了它的中间! 第一次！
Isn’t that fantastic! And, if I may say so, rather clever!’
是不是很棒! 而且，如果我可以这么说的话，相当聪明
The Small Foxes went wild with excitement.
小狐狸们兴奋得发狂了。
They started running around in all directions, chasing the stupid chickens.

‘Wait!’ ordered Mr Fox.
“等等!”福克斯先生命令道。
‘Don’t lose your heads! Stand back! Calm down! Let’s do this properly! First of all, everyone have a drink of water!’
不要失去理智！退后！冷静点！我们好好谈谈！首先，每个人都喝一杯水！’
They all ran over to the chickens’ drinking-trough and lapped up the lovely cool water.
他们都跑到鸡的饮水槽前，把可爱的凉水喝光了。
Then Mr Fox chose three of the plumpest hens, and with a clever flick of his jaws he killed them instantly.
然后，福克斯先生从最丰满的母鸡中挑选了三只，并巧妙地弹了弹下巴，立刻把它们杀死了。
‘Back to the tunnel!’ he ordered.

One after another, they climbed down through the hole in the floor
他们一个接一个地从地板上的洞爬下去
and soon they were all standing once again in the dark tunnel.
很快他们又都站在黑暗的隧道里。
Mr Fox reached up and pulled the floorboards back into place.

He did this with great care.
他做这件事非常小心。
He did it so that no one could tell they had ever been moved.

‘My son,’ he said, giving the three plump hens to the biggest of his four small children, ‘run back with these to your mother.
“我的儿子,”他说，把三只肥母鸡交给他四个小孩中最大的一个，“把这些拿回去给你妈妈。”。
Tell her to prepare a feast.

小狐狸背着三只肥母鸡沿着隧道尽可能快地跑回来。
He was exploding with joy.
他欣喜若狂。
‘Just wait!’ he kept thinking, ‘just wait till Mummy sees these!’

He had a long way to run but he never stopped once on the way and he came bursting in upon Mrs Fox.
他还有很长的一段路要跑，但是他从来没有在路上停下来过，他冲进来撞见了福克斯太太。
‘Mummy!’ he cried, out of breath.
“妈妈!”他气喘吁吁地喊道。
‘Look, Mummy, look! Wake up and see what I’ve brought you!’
看，妈妈，看! 醒来看看我给你带来了什么
Mrs Fox, who was weaker than ever now from lack of food, opened one eye and looked at the hens.
由于缺少食物，福克斯夫人现在比以往任何时候都虚弱，她睁开一只眼睛看着母鸡。
‘I’m dreaming,’ she murmured and closed the eye again.
“我在做梦,”她喃喃地说，又闭上了眼睛。
‘You’re not dreaming, Mummy! They’re real chickens! We’re saved! We’re not going to starve!’

‘Boggis’s Chicken House Number One!’ spluttered the Small Fox.
“伯吉斯的第一鸡舍!”小狐狸气急败坏地说。
‘We tunnelled right up under the floor and you’ve never seen so many big fat hens in all your life!
我们在地板下挖了一条隧道，你这辈子都没见过这么多肥母鸡！
And Dad said to prepare a feast! They’ll be back soon!’

‘Oh, what a fantastic fox your father is! Hurry up, child, and start plucking those chickens!’
“哦，你爸爸真是一只了不起的狐狸! 快点，孩子，开始拔鸡毛吧!”
Far away down in the tunnel, the fantastic Mr Fox was saying, ‘Now for the next bit, my darlings!
在远处的隧道里，神奇的狐狸先生正在说: “现在进行下一个环节，亲爱的!”！
This one’ll be as easy as pie! All we have to do is dig another little tunnel from here to there!’

Part 12, Badger
第12部分，獾
Mr Fox and the three remaining Small Foxes dug fast and straight.
狐狸先生和剩下的三只小狐狸快速而笔直地挖掘。
They were all too excited now to feel tired or hungry.
他们现在都太兴奋了，感觉不到疲倦或饥饿。
They knew they were going to have a whacking great feast before long and the fact that it was none other than Boggis’s chickens they were going to eat made them churgle with laughter every time they thought of it.
他们知道不久之后他们将会有一场盛大的宴会，而事实上他们要吃的不是别人，正是博吉斯的鸡，这使得他们每次想到这一点都会哈哈大笑。
It was lovely to realize that while the fat farmer was sitting up there on the hill waiting for them to starve,
当肥农坐在山上等着他们挨饿的时候，我很高兴地意识到,
he was also giving them their dinner without knowing it.
他还在不知不觉中给他们准备了晚餐。
‘Keep digging,’ said Mr Fox.
“继续挖,”福克斯先生说。
‘It’s not much further.’
不远了
All of a sudden a deep voice above their heads said, ‘Who goes there?’ The foxes jumped.
突然，一个低沉的声音在他们头上响起，“谁在那里?”狐狸跳了起来。
They looked up quickly and they saw, peeking through a small hole in the roof of the tunnel, a long black pointed furry face.
他们很快抬起头来，透过隧道顶部的一个小洞，他们看到了一张长长的、黑色的、尖尖的、毛茸茸的脸。
‘Badger!’ cried Mr Fox.
“獾!”福克斯先生喊道。
‘Foxy!’ cried Badger.
“狐狸!”獾叫道。
‘My goodness me, I’m glad I’ve found someone at last!
我的天啊，我很高兴我终于找到了一个人！
I’ve been digging around in circles for three days and nights and I haven’t the foggiest idea where I am!’
我已经绕了三天三夜的圈子，一点儿也不知道自己在哪儿
Badger made the hole in the ceiling bigger and dropped down beside the foxes.
獾把天花板上的洞弄得更大了，然后掉到了狐狸旁边。
A Small Badger (his son) dropped down after him.
一只小獾(他的儿子)在他后面掉了下来。
‘Haven’t you heard what’s happening up on the hill?’ Badger said excitedly.
“你没听说山上发生了什么事吗?”獾兴奋地说。
‘It’s chaos! Half the wood has disappeared and there are men with guns all over the countryside!
一片混乱! 一半的树木都消失了，乡下到处都是持枪的人！
None of us can get out, even at night! We’re all starving to death!’

That’s me and Mole and Rabbit and all our wives and children.
那是我，鼹鼠，兔子还有我们所有的妻子和孩子。
Even Weasel, who can usually sneak out of the tightest spots, is right now hiding down my hole with Mrs Weasel and six kids.
就连通常能从最危险的地方溜走的黄鼠狼现在也和黄鼠狼夫人还有六个孩子一起躲在我的洞里。
What on earth are we going to do, Foxy? I think we’re finished!’
我们到底该怎么办，狐狸? 我想我们完蛋了
Mr Fox looked at his three children and he smiled.
福克斯先生看着他的三个孩子，笑了。
The children smiled back at him, sharing his secret.

‘I know it’s your fault!’ said Badger furiously.
“我知道是你的错!”獾愤怒地说。
‘And the farmers are not going to give up till they’ve got you.
农民们不抓到你是不会放弃的。
Unfortunately, that means us as well.
不幸的是，我们也一样。
It means everyone on the hill.’ Badger sat down and put a paw around his small son.
獾坐了下来，用爪子抓住他的小儿子。
‘We’re done for,’ he said softly.

There’ll be plenty to go round, I can assure you.’
我可以向你保证，会有很多的。”
‘You mean it?’ cried Badger.
“你说真的?”獾叫道。
‘You really mean it?’
你是认真的吗
Mr Fox pushed his face close to Badger’s and whispered darkly, ‘Do you know where we’ve just been?’
狐狸先生把脸凑近獾的脸，低声说: “你知道我们刚才去哪儿了吗?”
‘Where?’
哪里
‘Right inside Boggis’s Chicken House Number One!’
就在伯吉斯的一号鸡舍里
‘No!’
“不!”
‘Yes! But that is nothing to where we are going now.
是的! 但是对于我们现在要去的地方来说，那不算什么。
You have come just at the right moment, my dear Badger.
你来得正是时候，我亲爱的獾。
You can help us dig.

And in the meanwhile, your small son can run back to Mrs Badger and all the others and spread the good news.’

Mr Fox turned to the Small Badger and said, ‘Tell them they are invited to a Fox’s Feast.
狐狸先生转向小獾说: “告诉他们，我们邀请他们参加狐狸的宴会。”。
Then bring them all down here and follow this tunnel back until you find my home!’
然后把他们都带到这里来，沿着这条隧道回去，直到你找到我的家
‘Yes, Mr Fox!’ said the Small Badger.
“是的，狐狸先生!”小獾说。
‘Yes, sir! Right away, sir! Oh, thank you, sir!’
是的，先生! 马上，先生! 哦，谢谢你，先生
and he scrambled quickly back through the hole in the roof of the tunnel and disappeared.
他迅速爬回隧道顶部的洞里，然后消失了。

‘What in the world has happened to your tail?’

Soon they were crouching underneath yet another wooden floor.
不久，他们又蹲在另一块木地板下面。
Mr Fox grinned slyly, showing sharp white teeth.
福克斯先生狡猾地咧嘴一笑，露出锋利的白牙。
‘If I am not mistaken, my dear Badger,’ he said,
“如果我没弄错的话，我亲爱的獾,”他说,
‘we are now underneath the farm which belongs to that nasty little pot-bellied dwarf, Bunce.
我们现在在农场的地下属于那个讨厌的大腹便便的矮人邦斯。
We are, in fact, directly underneath the most interesting part of that farm.’
事实上，我们就在农场最有趣的地方的正下方
‘Ducks and geese!’ cried the Small Foxes, licking their lips.
“鸭子和鹅!”小狐狸舔着嘴唇叫道。
‘Juicy tender ducks and big fat geese!’
鲜嫩多汁的鸭子和大肥鹅
‘Ex-actly!’ said Mr Fox.

“可是你怎么知道我们在哪儿呢?”獾问。
Mr Fox grinned again, showing even more white teeth.
福克斯先生又咧嘴笑了，露出了更多的白牙。
‘Look,’ he said, ‘I know my way around these farms blindfold.

for what they now saw was a kind of fox’s dream, a badger’s dream, a paradise for hungry animals.
因为他们现在看到的是一种狐狸的梦想，一种獾的梦想，一个饥饿动物的天堂。
‘This, my dear old Badger,’ proclaimed Mr Fox,
“这个，我亲爱的老獾,”福克斯先生说,
‘is Bunce’s Mighty Storehouse! All his finest stuff is stored in here before he sends it off to market.’

Against all the four walls of the great room, stacked in cupboards and piled upon shelves reaching from floor to ceiling,

were thousands and thousands of the finest and fattest ducks and geese, plucked and ready for roasting!

And up above, dangling from the rafters, there must have been at least a hundred smoked hams and fifty sides of bacon!
在房梁上方，至少有一百只烟熏火腿和五十片熏肉！
‘Just feast your eyes on that!’ cried Mr Fox, dancing up and down.
“让你的眼睛大饱眼福吧!”福克斯先生叫道，跳上跳下。
‘What d’you think of it, eh? Pretty good grub!’
“你觉得怎么样，嗯? 很不错的食物!”
Suddenly, as though springs had been released in their legs,
突然，他们的腿仿佛放出了弹簧,
the three hungry Small Foxes and the ravenously hungry Badger sprang forward to grab the luscious food.
三只饥肠辘辘的小狐狸和一只饥肠辘辘的獾跳上前去抢夺这些美味的食物。
‘Stop!’ ordered Mr Fox.
“站住!”福克斯先生命令道。
‘This is my party, so I shall do the choosing.’ The others fell back, licking their chops.
“这是我的派对，所以由我来选择。”其他人退后一步，舔了舔嘴唇。
Mr Fox began prowling around the storehouse examining the glorious display with an expert eye.
福克斯先生开始在仓库周围徘徊，用专业的眼光审视着这一壮观的展品。
A thread of saliva slid down one side of his jaw and hung suspended in mid-air, then snapped.
一丝唾液从他下巴的一侧滑下，悬在半空中，然后断了。
‘We mustn’t overdo it,’ he said.
他说，我们不能做过头了。

Mustn’t let them know what we’ve been up to.
不能让他们知道我们在做什么。
We must be neat and tidy and take just a few of the choicest morsels.

So, to start with we shall have four plump young ducks.’ He took them from the shelf.
“那么，我们先要四只肥嘟嘟的小鸭子。”他从架子上拿下来。
‘Oh, how lovely and fat they are! No wonder Bunce gets a special price for them in the market! ,
“哦，它们多么可爱、多么肥美啊! 难怪邦斯在市场上能以特价买到它们!”
All right, Badger, lend me a hand to get them down , You children can help as well ,
好了，獾，帮我把他们弄下来，你们也可以帮忙,
There we go , Goodness me, look how your mouths are watering ,
就是这样，天啊，看看你们嘴里都是水,
And now , I think we had better have a few geese , Three will be quite enough , We’ll take the biggest ,
现在，我想我们最好有几只鹅，三只就够了，我们要最大的,
Oh my, oh my, you’ll never see finer geese than these in a king’s kitchen ,

Gently does it , that’s the way , And what about a couple of nice smoked hams ,

‘What a thoughtful little fellow you are! Take ten bunches of carrots!’
“你真是个体贴的小家伙! 拿十捆胡萝卜吧!”
Soon, all this lovely loot was lying in a neat heap upon the floor.
很快，所有这些可爱的战利品整齐地堆放在地板上。
The Small Foxes crouched close, their noses twitching, their eyes shining like stars.
小狐狸蜷缩在一起，它们的鼻子抽动着，它们的眼睛像星星一样闪闪发光。
‘And now,’ said Mr Fox, ‘we shall have to borrow from our friend Bunce two of those useful push-carts over in the corner.’
“现在,”福克斯先生说，“我们得向我们的朋友邦斯借两辆角落里的那种有用的手推车了。”
He and Badger fetched the push-carts, and the ducks and geese and hams and bacon were loaded on to them.
他和獾推着手推车，把鸭子、鹅、火腿和熏肉装上车。
Quickly the push-carts were lowered through the hole in the floor.

The animals slid down after them.
动物们跟在他们后面滑下来。
Back in the tunnel, Mr Fox again pulled the floorboards very carefully into place so that no one could see they had been moved.
回到隧道里，福克斯先生再一次非常小心地把地板拉到合适的位置，这样就没有人能看到它们被移动过。
‘My darlings,’ he said, pointing to two of the three Small Foxes,
“亲爱的,”他指着三只小狐狸中的两只说,
‘take a cart each and run back as fast as you can to your mother.
每人推一辆马车，尽快跑回你母亲身边。
Give her my love and tell her we are having guests for dinner – the Badgers, the Moles, the Rabbits and the Weasels.

And tell her the rest of us will be home as soon as we’ve done one more little job.’

‘Where?’ asked Badger.

‘Well,’ said the Smallest Fox.
“好吧,”最小的狐狸说。
‘We’ve been to Boggis and we’ve been to Bunce but we haven’t been to Bean.

It must be Bean.’
一定是比恩
‘You are right,’ said Mr Fox.
“你说得对,”福克斯先生说。
‘But what you don’t know is which part of Bean’s place we are about to visit.’
但你不知道的是我们要去比恩家的哪个地方
‘Which?’ they said both together.
“哪个?”他们一起问。
‘Ah-ha,’ said Mr Fox.

There was a short silence while Badger thought deeply about this.

‘You are far too respectable,’ said Mr Fox.

‘There’s nothing wrong with being respectable,’ Badger said.

‘Look,’ said Mr Fox, ‘Boggis and Bunce and Bean are out to kill us.

Five minutes later, Badger’s front paws hit against something flat and hard.

‘What on earth is this?’ he said.

‘It looks like a solid stone wall.’ He and Mr Fox scraped away the soil.

But it was built of bricks, not stones.

Part 15, Bean’s Secret Cider Cellar

Mr Fox examined the wall carefully.

He saw that the cement between the bricks was old and crumbly, so he loosened a brick without much trouble and pulled it away.

Suddenly, out from the hole where the brick had been, there popped a small sharp face with whiskers, ‘Go away!’ it snapped.

‘You can’t come in here! It’s private!’

福克斯先生露出一个灿烂的笑容，露出洁白的牙齿。
‘My dear Rat,’ he said softly, ‘I am a hungry fellow and if you don’t hop it quickly I shall eat-you-up-in-one-gulp!’
“我亲爱的河鼠,”他温柔地说，“我是一个饥饿的家伙，如果你不赶快跳起来，我就一口把你吃掉!”
That did it.
成功了。
Rat popped back fast out of sight.
老鼠飞快地跑了回来，消失在视线之外。
Mr Fox laughed and began pulling more bricks out of the wall.

Badger and the Smallest Fox followed him in.

獾和最小的狐狸凝视着半明半暗的天空。
As their eyes became accustomed to the gloom,

‘It will make the feast into a banquet,’ said Mr Fox.
福克斯先生说，这会使宴会变成一场盛宴。
While they were talking, the Smallest Fox had sneaked a jar off the shelf and had taken a gulp.
他们说话的时候，小狐狸从架子上偷拿了一个罐子，喝了一大口。
‘Wow!’ he gasped.
“哇!”他倒抽了一口冷气。
‘Wow-ee!’
哇
You must understand this was not the ordinary weak fizzy cider one buys in a store.

It was the real stuff, a home-brewed fiery liquor that burned in your throat and boiled in your stomach.
这是真正的东西，一个家庭自酿烈酒，燃烧在你的喉咙，煮在你的胃。
‘Ah-h-h-h-h-h!’ gasped the Smallest Fox.

‘This is some cider!’

‘It’s miraculous!’ he whispered, fighting for breath.

“哦，狐狸，这就像喝阳光和彩虹!”
‘You’re poaching!’ shrieked Rat.
“你在偷猎!”河鼠尖叫道。
‘Put that down at once! There’ll be none left for me!’
马上把它放下! 我什么都没有了
Rat was perched upon the highest shelf in the cellar, peering out from behind a huge jar.
老鼠坐在地下室最高的架子上，从一个巨大的罐子后面向外张望。
There was a small rubber tube inserted in the neck of the jar, and Rat was using this tube to suck out the cider.
在罐子的颈部插入了一个小橡胶管，老鼠正在用这个管子吸出苹果酒。
‘You’re drunk!’ said Mr Fox.
“你喝醉了!”福克斯先生说。
‘Mind your own business!’ shrieked Rat.
“管好你自己的事!”河鼠尖叫道。
‘And if you great clumsy brutes come messing about in here we’ll all be caught! Get out and leave me to sip my cider in peace.’
如果你们这些笨手笨脚的畜生来这里捣乱，我们都会被抓住的！出去，让我安静地喝苹果酒。’
At that moment they heard a woman’s voice calling out in the house above them.
就在这时，他们听到一个女人的声音在他们上面的房子里呼喊。
‘Hurry up and get that cider, Mabel!’ the voice called.

现在有人开始走下台阶。

‘Quick!’ said Mr Fox.
“快!”福克斯先生说。
‘Hide!’ He and Badger and the Smallest Fox jumped up on to a shelf and crouched behind a row of big cider jars.
躲起来！他和獾还有最小的狐狸跳上一个架子，蹲在一排大苹果酒罐子后面。
Peering around the jars, they saw a huge woman coming down into the cellar.
他们环顾着罐子，看见一个高大的女人从地下室走下来。
At the foot of the steps, the woman paused, looking to right and left.
在台阶下，女人停了下来，左右看了看。
Then she turned and headed straight for the place where Mr Fox and Badger and the Smallest Fox were hiding.
然后她转过身，径直朝狐狸先生、獾和小狐狸藏身的地方走去。

She was so close, Mr Fox could hear the sound of her breathing.
她离得那么近，福克斯先生都能听到她的呼吸声。
Peeping through the crack between two bottles, he noticed that she carried a big rolling-pin in one hand.
他透过两个瓶子之间的缝隙，注意到她一只手拿着一个大擀面杖。
‘How many will he want this time, Mrs Bean?’ the woman shouted.
“憨豆太太，这次他要多少?”妇人喊道。
And from the top of the steps the other voice called back, ‘Bring up two or three jars.’
又有一个声音从台阶上回来，说，拿两三个坛来
‘He drank four yesterday, Mrs Bean.’
他昨天喝了四杯，憨豆太太
‘Yes, but he won’t want that many today because he’s not going to be up there more than a few hours longer.
是的，但是他今天不会要那么多，因为他不会在那里多呆几个小时。
He says the fox is bound to make a run for it this morning.

It can’t possibly stay down that hole another day without food.’

The woman in the cellar reached out and lifted a jar of cider from the shelf.
地下室的女人伸手从架子上拿起一罐苹果酒。
The jar she took was next but one to the jar behind which Mr Fox was crouching.
她拿走的那个罐子就在狐狸先生蹲着的那个罐子旁边。
‘I’ll be glad when the rotten brute is killed and strung up on the front porch,’ she called out.
“当这个腐烂的畜生被杀死并吊死在门廊上的时候，我会很高兴的,”她喊道。
‘And by the way, Mrs Bean, your husband promised I could have the tail as a souvenir.’
顺便说一句，憨豆太太，你丈夫答应我可以把尾巴留作纪念品
‘The tail’s been all shot to pieces,’ said the voice from upstairs.
“尾巴都被打成碎片了,”楼上的声音说。
‘Didn’t you know that?’
你不知道吗
‘You mean it’s ruined?’
你是说它被毁了
‘Of course it’s ruined.

你可以把它做成标本挂在你卧室的墙上。
Hurry up now with that cider!’
快点拿苹果酒来
‘Yes, Ma’am, I’m coming,’ said the big woman, and she took a second jar from the shelf.
“是的，夫人，我来了,”大个子女人说着，从架子上拿出第二个罐子。
If she takes one more, she’ll see us, thought Mr Fox.
如果她再吃一片，她就会看到我们了，福克斯先生想。
He could feel the Smallest Fox’s body pressed tightly against his own, quivering with excitement.
他能感觉到小狐狸的身体紧紧地压在自己身上，兴奋地颤抖着。
‘Will two be enough, Mrs Bean, or shall I take three?’
两个够吗，豆豆太太，还是我拿三个
‘My goodness, Mabel, I don’t care so long as you get a move on!’
我的天啊，梅宝，我不在乎，只要你动起来
‘Then two it is,’ said the huge woman, speaking to herself now.
“那就两个吧,”那个高大的女人自言自语地说。
‘He drinks too much anyway.’
