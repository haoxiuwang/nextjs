THERE IS NO ONE LEFT<font class="cyxy-trs-target"> 已经没有人了</font></h2>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
When Mary Lennox was sent to Misselthwaite Manor to live with her uncle
everybody said she was the most disagreeable-looking child ever seen. It was
true, too. She had a little thin face and a little thin body, thin light hair
and a sour expression. Her hair was yellow, and her face was yellow because she
had been born in India and had always been ill in one way or another. Her
father had held a position under the English Government and had always been
busy and ill himself, and her mother had been a great beauty who cared only to
go to parties and amuse herself with gay people. She had not wanted a little
girl at all, and when Mary was born she handed her over to the care of an Ayah,
who was made to understand that if she wished to please the Mem Sahib she must
keep the child out of sight as much as possible. So when she was a sickly,
fretful, ugly little baby she was kept out of the way, and when she became a
sickly, fretful, toddling thing she was kept out of the way also. She never
remembered seeing familiarly anything but the dark faces of her Ayah and the
other native servants, and as they always obeyed her and gave her her own way
in everything, because the Mem Sahib would be angry if she was disturbed by her
crying, by the time she was six years old she was as tyrannical and selfish a
little pig as ever lived. The young English governess who came to teach her to
read and write disliked her so much that she gave up her place in three months,
and when other governesses came to try to fill it they always went away in a
shorter time than the first one. So if Mary had not chosen to really want to
know how to read books she would never have learned her letters at all.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">当玛丽 · 伦诺克斯被送到 Misselthwaite Manor 和她叔叔一起生活时，每个人都说她是有史以来最难相处的孩子。这也是真的。她有一张瘦小的脸，一个瘦小的身体，稀疏的浅色头发和一个酸溜溜的表情。她的头发是黄色的，她的脸是黄色的，因为她出生在印度，而且总是以这样或那样的方式生病。她的父亲曾在英国政府任职，自己总是忙碌而且生病，她的母亲是个大美，只关心参加聚会，和同性恋者一起消遣。她根本不想要一个小女孩，玛丽出生的时候，她把她交给了一个叫阿雅的人照顾。阿雅被教导，如果她想取悦 Mem Sahib，她就必须尽可能地让孩子远离人们的视线。所以当她还是一个病怏怏、烦躁不安、丑陋不堪的小婴儿的时候，她被挡在了外面，当她变成一个病怏怏、烦躁不安、蹒跚学步的小东西的时候，她也被挡在了外面。除了她的阿亚和其他当地仆人的黑脸，她从来没有看到过什么熟悉的东西，因为他们总是服从她，在任何事情上都给她自己的路，因为如果她被她的哭声打扰，Mem Sahib 会生气，到她六岁的时候，她是一个暴虐和自私的小猪活着。来教她读书写字的年轻英国女家庭教师非常不喜欢她，以至于她在三个月内就放弃了自己的职位，而当其他女家庭教师来填补空缺时，她们离开的时间总是比第一个家庭教师短。因此，如果玛丽没有选择真正想知道如何读书，她就根本不会学习她的书信。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
One frightfully hot morning, when she was about nine years old, she awakened
feeling very cross, and she became crosser still when she saw that the servant
who stood by her bedside was not her Ayah.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">一个可怕的炎热的早晨，当她大约九岁的时候，她醒来的时候感到非常生气，当她看到站在她床边的仆人不是她的阿姨时，她更生气了。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“Why did you come?” she said to the strange woman. “I will
not let you stay. Send my Ayah to me.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“你为什么来?”她对那个陌生女人说。我不会让你留下。把我的阿亚交给我”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
The woman looked frightened, but she only stammered that the Ayah could not
come and when Mary threw herself into a passion and beat and kicked her, she
looked only more frightened and repeated that it was not possible for the Ayah
to come to Missie Sahib.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">那个女人看起来很害怕，但是她只是结结巴巴地说阿亚族人不能来。当玛丽全身心地投入到一种激情中，打她，踢她的时候，她看起来更加害怕，并且重复说阿亚族人不可能来 Missie Sahib。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
There was something mysterious in the air that morning. Nothing was done in its
regular order and several of the native servants seemed missing, while those
whom Mary saw slunk or hurried about with ashy and scared faces. But no one
would tell her anything and her Ayah did not come. She was actually left alone
as the morning went on, and at last she wandered out into the garden and began
to play by herself under a tree near the veranda. She pretended that she was
making a flower-bed, and she stuck big scarlet hibiscus blossoms into little
heaps of earth, all the time growing more and more angry and muttering to
herself the things she would say and the names she would call Saidie when she
returned.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">那天早上空气中弥漫着神秘的气息。一切都没有按照正常的顺序进行，好几个当地的仆人似乎失踪了，而玛丽看到的那些人或是偷偷摸摸的，或是满脸灰色和惊恐地跑来跑去。但是没有人告诉她任何事情，她的阿亚也没有来。随着早晨的过去，她实际上是一个人，最后她走进花园，开始独自在阳台附近的一棵树下玩耍。她假装自己在做一个花坛，把一朵朵鲜红的木槿花插在一小堆土里，一直越来越生气，自言自语地念叨着她回来后要说的话和要叫赛迪的名字。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“Pig! Pig! Daughter of Pigs!” she said, because to call a native a
pig is the worst insult of all.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“猪! 猪! 猪的女儿!”她说，因为把当地人叫猪是最大的侮辱。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
She was grinding her teeth and saying this over and over again when she heard
her mother come out on the veranda with someone. She was with a fair young man
and they stood talking together in low strange voices. Mary knew the fair young
man who looked like a boy. She had heard that he was a very young officer who
had just come from England. The child stared at him, but she stared most at her
mother. She always did this when she had a chance to see her, because the Mem
Sahib—Mary used to call her that oftener than anything else—was
such a tall, slim, pretty person and wore such lovely clothes. Her hair was
like curly silk and she had a delicate little nose which seemed to be
disdaining things, and she had large laughing eyes. All her clothes were thin
and floating, and Mary said they were “full of lace.” They looked
fuller of lace than ever this morning, but her eyes were not laughing at all.
They were large and scared and lifted imploringly to the fair boy
officer’s face.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">她咬着牙，一遍又一遍地说着这句话，这时她听到她妈妈和一个人从阳台上走了出来。她和一个漂亮的年轻人在一起，他们站在一起用奇怪的低声说话。玛丽认识那个长得像男孩的漂亮年轻人。她听说他是一个刚从英国来的年轻军官。孩子盯着他，但她最多的是盯着她的母亲。每当有机会见到她时，她总是这样做，因为玛丽过去常常这样称呼她，她是一个高挑、苗条、漂亮的人，穿着非常可爱的衣服。她的头发像卷曲的丝绸，她有一个精致的小鼻子，似乎是轻蔑的东西，她有大笑的眼睛。她所有的衣服都又薄又漂浮，玛丽说它们“充满了蕾丝”今天早上，它们看起来比以往更加花边，但是她的眼睛一点也没有笑。它们又大又吓人，哀求地举到那个漂亮的男孩军官面前。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“Is it so very bad? Oh, is it?” Mary heard her say.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“有那么糟糕吗? 哦，是吗?”玛丽听到她说。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“Awfully,” the young man answered in a trembling voice.
“Awfully, Mrs. Lennox. You ought to have gone to the hills two weeks
ago.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“太可怕了,”年轻人用颤抖的声音回答。”非常抱歉 Lennox 夫人。你两个星期前就该上山去了。”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
The Mem Sahib wrung her hands.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">议长扭动着她的手。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“Oh, I know I ought!” she cried. “I only stayed to go to that
silly dinner party. What a fool I was!”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“哦，我知道我应该!”她哭了。我留下来只是为了参加那个愚蠢的晚宴。我真是个傻瓜!”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
At that very moment such a loud sound of wailing broke out from the
servants’ quarters that she clutched the young man’s arm, and Mary
stood shivering from head to foot. The wailing grew wilder and wilder.
“What is it? What is it?” Mrs. Lennox gasped.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">就在这时，仆人的房间里突然传出一阵大哭声，玛丽紧紧抓住那个年轻人的胳膊，浑身颤抖地站在那里。哭声越来越大。“这是什么？这是什么?”伦诺克斯太太倒抽了一口冷气。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“Someone has died,” answered the boy officer. “You did not
say it had broken out among your servants.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“有人死了,”少年军官回答说，“你没说是在你的仆人中间发生的。”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“I did not know!” the Mem Sahib cried. “Come with me! Come
with me!” and she turned and ran into the house.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“我不知道!”大人哭了。“跟我来！跟我来!”她转身跑进了房子。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
After that appalling things happened, and the mysteriousness of the morning
was explained to Mary. The cholera had broken out in its most fatal form and
people were dying like flies. The Ayah had been taken ill in the night, and it
was because she had just died that the servants had wailed in the huts. Before
the next day three other servants were dead and others had run away in terror.
There was panic on every side, and dying people in all the bungalows.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">在那之后，可怕的事情发生了，那天早晨的神秘事件被向玛丽解释了。霍乱以其最致命的形式爆发了，人们像苍蝇一样死去。阿雅在夜里生病了，正是因为她刚刚死去，仆人们才在小屋里哀号。第二天以前，又有三个仆人死了，其他人惊恐地逃走了。到处都是恐慌，所有的平房里都是垂死的人。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
During the confusion and bewilderment of the second day Mary hid herself in the
nursery and was forgotten by everyone. Nobody thought of her, nobody wanted
her, and strange things happened of which she knew nothing. Mary alternately
cried and slept through the hours. She only knew that people were ill and that
she heard mysterious and frightening sounds. Once she crept into the
dining-room and found it empty, though a partly finished meal was on the table
and chairs and plates looked as if they had been hastily pushed back when the
diners rose suddenly for some reason. The child ate some fruit and biscuits,
and being thirsty she drank a glass of wine which stood nearly filled. It was
sweet, and she did not know how strong it was. Very soon it made her intensely
drowsy, and she went back to her nursery and shut herself in again, frightened
by cries she heard in the huts and by the hurrying sound of feet. The wine made
her so sleepy that she could scarcely keep her eyes open and she lay down on
her bed and knew nothing more for a long time.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">在第二天的混乱和困惑中，玛丽躲进了育儿室，被大家遗忘了。没有人想起她，没有人想要她，奇怪的事情发生了，而她对此一无所知。玛丽时而哭，时而睡。她只知道人们生病了，她听到了神秘而可怕的声音。她蹑手蹑脚地走进餐厅，发现里面空无一人，尽管桌子上有一顿吃了一半的饭，椅子和盘子看起来好像被匆忙地推回去了，因为食客们不知道为什么突然站起来了。孩子吃了一些水果和饼干，口渴的时候，她喝了一杯几乎满了的葡萄酒。这是甜的，她不知道它是多么强大。很快，这使她昏昏欲睡，她回到育儿室，又把自己关在里面，害怕听到小屋里的哭声和急促的脚步声。酒让她昏昏欲睡，几乎睁不开眼睛，她躺在床上，很长一段时间什么也不知道。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
Many things happened during the hours in which she slept so heavily, but she
was not disturbed by the wails and the sound of things being carried in and out
of the bungalow.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">在她睡得那么沉的几个小时里发生了很多事情，但是她没有被哭声和东西进出平房的声音所打扰。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
When she awakened she lay and stared at the wall. The house was perfectly
still. She had never known it to be so silent before. She heard neither voices
nor footsteps, and wondered if everybody had got well of the cholera and all
the trouble was over. She wondered also who would take care of her now her Ayah
was dead. There would be a new Ayah, and perhaps she would know some new
stories. Mary had been rather tired of the old ones. She did not cry because
her nurse had died. She was not an affectionate child and had never cared much
for anyone. The noise and hurrying about and wailing over the cholera had
frightened her, and she had been angry because no one seemed to remember that
she was alive. Everyone was too panic-stricken to think of a little girl no one
was fond of. When people had the cholera it seemed that they remembered nothing
but themselves. But if everyone had got well again, surely someone would
remember and come to look for her.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">当她醒来时，她躺在那里，盯着墙壁。房子一点动静都没有。她以前从来不知道这里这么安静。她既听不到声音也听不到脚步声，不知道是否每个人都从霍乱中康复了，所有的麻烦都结束了。她也想知道现在她的阿亚死了，谁来照顾她。会有一个新的阿雅，也许她会知道一些新的故事。玛丽对那些旧的已经相当厌倦了。她没有哭，因为她的护士死了。她不是一个多愁善感的孩子，从来没有关心过任何人。霍乱带来的噪音、匆忙和哀号把她吓坏了，她很生气，因为似乎没有人记得她还活着。每个人都惊慌失措，想不起一个没人喜欢的小女孩。当人们患上霍乱时，他们似乎只记得自己。但是如果每个人都康复了，肯定会有人记得并来找她的。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
But no one came, and as she lay waiting the house seemed to grow more and more
silent. She heard something rustling on the matting and when she looked down
she saw a little snake gliding along and watching her with eyes like jewels.
She was not frightened, because he was a harmless little thing who would not
hurt her and he seemed in a hurry to get out of the room. He slipped under the
door as she watched him.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">但是没有人来，当她躺着等待的时候，屋子里似乎变得越来越安静。她听到席子上有什么东西在沙沙作响，当她向下看时，她看到一条小蛇在滑行，用宝石一样的眼睛注视着她。她并不害怕，因为他是一个不会伤害她的无害的小东西，他似乎急于离开房间。她注视着他，他从门缝里钻了进去。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“How queer and quiet it is,” she said. “It sounds as if there
were no one in the bungalow but me and the snake.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“多么奇怪和安静啊,”她说。“听起来好像平房里除了我和蛇就没有别人了。”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
Almost the next minute she heard footsteps in the compound, and then on the
veranda. They were men’s footsteps, and the men entered the bungalow and
talked in low voices. No one went to meet or speak to them and they seemed to
open doors and look into rooms.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">几乎下一分钟，她就听到了院子里的脚步声，然后是走廊上的脚步声。那是男人的脚步声，男人们走进平房，低声交谈着。没有人去见他们，也没有人和他们说话，他们似乎打开门，向房间里张望。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“What desolation!” she heard one voice say. “That pretty,
pretty woman! I suppose the child, too. I heard there was a child, though no
one ever saw her.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“多么荒凉!”她听到一个声音说。“那个漂亮，漂亮的女人！我想孩子也是。我听说有个孩子，但没人见过她。”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
Mary was standing in the middle of the nursery when they opened the door a few
minutes later. She looked an ugly, cross little thing and was frowning because
she was beginning to be hungry and feel disgracefully neglected. The first man
who came in was a large officer she had once seen talking to her father. He
looked tired and troubled, but when he saw her he was so startled that he
almost jumped back.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">几分钟后他们打开门时，玛丽正站在育儿室的中央。她看起来是一个丑陋的、脾气暴躁的小东西，正皱着眉头，因为她开始觉得饿了，觉得自己被忽视了。第一个走进来的是一个高大的军官，她曾经见过他和父亲说话。他看上去疲惫不堪，忧心忡忡，但当他看到她时，他吓了一跳，差点跳了回去。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“Barney!” he cried out. “There is a child here! A child
alone! In a place like this! Mercy on us, who is she!”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“巴尼!”他喊道。“这里有个孩子！一个孩子！在这种地方！饶了我们吧，她是谁!”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“I am Mary Lennox,” the little girl said, drawing herself up
stiffly. She thought the man was very rude to call her father’s bungalow
“A place like this!” “I fell asleep when everyone had the
cholera and I have only just wakened up. Why does nobody come?”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“我是玛丽 · 伦诺克斯,”小女孩说着，僵硬地站了起来。她认为那个男人把她父亲的平房叫做“这样的地方”是非常粗鲁的“当所有人都得了霍乱时，我睡着了，我才刚刚醒来。为什么没人来?”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“It is the child no one ever saw!” exclaimed the man, turning to
his companions. “She has actually been forgotten!”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“这是一个从来没有人见过的孩子!”男人大声说，转向他的同伴。“她竟然被人遗忘了!”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“Why was I forgotten?” Mary said, stamping her foot. “Why
does nobody come?”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“为什么我被遗忘了?”玛丽跺着脚说，“为什么没有人来?”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
The young man whose name was Barney looked at her very sadly. Mary even thought
she saw him wink his eyes as if to wink tears away.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">那个名叫巴尼的年轻人很伤心地看着她。玛丽甚至认为她看见他眨眼睛，好像是要眨眼把眼泪带走。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“Poor little kid!” he said. “There is nobody left to
come.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“可怜的小孩!”他说，“没有人能来了。”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
It was in that strange and sudden way that Mary found out that she had neither
father nor mother left; that they had died and been carried away in the night,
and that the few native servants who had not died also had left the house as
quickly as they could get out of it, none of them even remembering that there
was a Missie Sahib. That was why the place was so quiet. It was true that there
was no one in the bungalow but herself and the little rustling snake.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">就这样，玛丽突然发现自己失去了父亲和母亲，他们死了，在夜里被抬走了，几个没有死的本地仆人也尽快离开了房子，他们甚至都不记得有一个 Missie Sahib。所以这里才这么安静。的确，平房里除了她自己和那条沙沙作响的小蛇，没有别人。</p>

Mary had liked to look at her mother from a distance and she had thought her
very pretty, but as she knew very little of her she could scarcely have been
expected to love her or to miss her very much when she was gone. She did not
miss her at all, in fact, and as she was a self-absorbed child she gave her
entire thought to herself, as she had always done. If she had been older she
would no doubt have been very anxious at being left alone in the world, but she
was very young, and as she had always been taken care of, she supposed she
always would be. What she thought was that she would like to know if she was
going to nice people, who would be polite to her and give her her own way as
her Ayah and the other native servants had done.

She knew that she was not going to stay at the English clergyman’s house
where she was taken at first. She did not want to stay. The English clergyman
was poor and he had five children nearly all the same age and they wore shabby
clothes and were always quarreling and snatching toys from each other. Mary
hated their untidy bungalow and was so disagreeable to them that after the
first day or two nobody would play with her. By the second day they had given
her a nickname which made her furious.

It was Basil who thought of it first. Basil was a little boy with impudent blue
eyes and a turned-up nose, and Mary hated him. She was playing by herself under

But she thought over it a great deal afterward; and when Mrs. Crawford told her
that night that she was going to sail away to England in a few days and go to
her uncle, Mr. Archibald Craven, who lived at Misselthwaite Manor, she looked
so stony and stubbornly uninterested that they did not know what to think about
her. They tried to be kind to her, but she only turned her face away when Mrs.

“She is such a plain child,” Mrs. Crawford said pityingly,
afterward. “And her mother was such a pretty creature. She had a very

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“Perhaps if her mother had carried her pretty face and her pretty manners

“I believe she scarcely ever looked at her,” sighed Mrs. Crawford.
“When her Ayah was dead there was no one to give a thought to the little
thing. Think of the servants running away and leaving her all alone in that
deserted bungalow. Colonel McGrew said he nearly jumped out of his skin when he
opened the door and found her standing by herself in the middle of the

Mary made the long voyage to England under the care of an officer’s wife,
who was taking her children to leave them in a boarding-school. She was very
much absorbed in her own little boy and girl, and was rather glad to hand the
child over to the woman Mr. Archibald Craven sent to meet her, in London. The
woman was his housekeeper at Misselthwaite Manor, and her name was Mrs.
Medlock. She was a stout woman, with very red cheeks and sharp black eyes. She
wore a very purple dress, a black silk mantle with jet fringe on it and a black
bonnet with purple velvet flowers which stuck up and trembled when she moved
her head. Mary did not like her at all, but as she very seldom liked people
there was nothing remarkable in that; besides which it was very evident Mrs.
Medlock did not think much of her.

“My word! she’s a plain little piece of goods!” she said.

They thought Mary was not listening because she was standing a little apart
from them at the window of the private hotel they had gone to. She was watching
the passing buses and cabs and people, but she heard quite well and was made

one. Perhaps there were none in India.

Since she had been living in other people’s houses and had had no Ayah,
she had begun to feel lonely and to think queer thoughts which were new to her.
She had begun to wonder why she had never seemed to belong to anyone even when
her father and mother had been alive. Other children seemed to belong to their
fathers and mothers, but she had never seemed to really be anyone’s
little girl. She had had servants, and food and clothes, but no one had taken
any notice of her. She did not know that this was because she was a
disagreeable child; but then, of course, she did not know she was disagreeable.
She often thought that other people were, but she did not know that she was so
herself.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">因为她一直住在别人的房子里，没有阿姨，所以她开始感到孤独，开始想一些对她来说很新奇的奇怪的想法。她开始怀疑，为什么即使她的父母在世时，她似乎从来没有属于过任何人。其他孩子似乎属于他们的父母，但她似乎从来没有真正成为任何人的小女孩。她有仆人，有食物和衣服，但是没有人注意到她。她不知道这是因为她是个讨人厌的孩子; 但是，当然，她也不知道她是个讨人厌的孩子。她常常认为别人是这样的，但她不知道自己就是这样的人。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
She thought Mrs. Medlock the most disagreeable person she had ever seen, with
her common, highly colored face and her common fine bonnet. When the next day
they set out on their journey to Yorkshire, she walked through the station to
the railway carriage with her head up and trying to keep as far away from her
as she could, because she did not want to seem to belong to her. It would have
made her angry to think people imagined she was her little girl.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">她认为梅德洛克太太是她见过的最令人讨厌的人，她有着一张普通的、五颜六色的脸和一顶普通的漂亮帽子。第二天，他们出发去约克郡，她昂着头穿过车站走到铁路客车，尽可能地远离自己，因为她不想看起来像是自己的人。一想到别人把她当成自己的女儿，她就会生气。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
But Mrs. Medlock was not in the least disturbed by her and her thoughts. She
was the kind of woman who would “stand no nonsense from young
ones.” At least, that is what she would have said if she had been asked.
She had not wanted to go to London just when her sister Maria’s daughter
was going to be married, but she had a comfortable, well paid place as
housekeeper at Misselthwaite Manor and the only way in which she could keep it
was to do at once what Mr. Archibald Craven told her to do. She never dared
even to ask a question.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">但是梅德洛克夫人丝毫没有被她和她的想法所打扰。她是那种“不会容忍年轻人胡说八道”的女人至少，如果有人问她，她会这么说。她不想在她姐姐玛丽亚的女儿要结婚的时候去伦敦，但是她在 Misselthwaite Manor 有一个舒适的、收入丰厚的管家职位，她能保住这个职位的唯一办法就是按照阿奇博尔德 · 克雷文先生的吩咐立刻去做。她连一个问题都不敢问。</p>

“Captain Lennox and his wife died of the cholera,” Mr. Craven had

Mary sat in her corner of the railway carriage and looked plain and fretful.

“A more marred-looking young one I never saw in my life,” Mrs.

“Not but that it’s a grand big place in a gloomy way, and Mr.

up and locked. And there’s pictures and fine old furniture and things
that’s been there for ages, and there’s a big park round it and
gardens and trees with branches trailing to the ground—some of

the West Wing and won’t let anyone but Pitcher see him. Pitcher’s
an old fellow, but he took care of him when he was a child and he knows his
ways.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“是的，她死了,”梅德洛克太太回答。这让他变得更加古怪。他谁也不在乎。他不见人。大多数时候他都会离开，当他在 Misselthwaite 的时候，他会把自己关在白宫西翼，不让任何人看到他，除了皮彻。皮彻是个老家伙，但他在他小时候照顾过他，而且他知道自己的路。”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
It sounded like something in a book and it did not make Mary feel cheerful. A
house with a hundred rooms, nearly all shut up and with their doors
locked—a house on the edge of a moor—whatsoever a moor
was—sounded dreary. A man with a crooked back who shut himself up also!
She stared out of the window with her lips pinched together, and it seemed
quite natural that the rain should have begun to pour down in gray slanting
lines and splash and stream down the window-panes. If the pretty wife had been
alive she might have made things cheerful by being something like her own
mother and by running in and out and going to parties as she had done in frocks
“full of lace.” But she was not there any more.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">这听起来像是书里的东西，并没有使玛丽感到高兴。一座有一百个房间的房子，几乎都关上了，门也锁上了ーー这是一座位于沼地边缘的房子ーー不管沼地是什么样子ーー听起来很沉闷。一个驼背的男人也把自己关起来了！她紧抿着嘴唇凝视着窗外，雨水自然而然地倾泻下来，形成一条条灰色的斜线，从窗玻璃上飞溅而下。如果这位漂亮的妻子还活着，她可能会像她自己的母亲一样，跑进跑出，参加聚会，就像她穿着“充满蕾丝”的连衣裙那样，使事情变得令人愉快但她已经不在了。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“You needn’t expect to see him, because ten to one you
won’t,” said Mrs. Medlock. “And you mustn’t expect that
there will be people to talk to you. You’ll have to play about and look
after yourself. You’ll be told what rooms you can go into and what rooms
you’re to keep out of. There’s gardens enough. But when
you’re in the house don’t go wandering and poking about. Mr. Craven
won’t have it.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“你不必指望能见到他，因为十有八九你见不到他,”梅德洛克太太说。你不能指望会有人跟你说话。你必须到处玩，照顾好自己。你们会被告知可以进入哪些房间以及不能进入哪些房间。这里有足够的花园。但是当你在家的时候，不要到处乱逛。克雷文先生不会同意的”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“I shall not want to go poking about,” said sour little Mary and
just as suddenly as she had begun to be rather sorry for Mr. Archibald Craven
she began to cease to be sorry and to think he was unpleasant enough to deserve
all that had happened to him.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“我不想去打听了,”酸溜溜的小玛丽说，就像她突然开始为阿奇博尔德 · 克雷文先生感到难过一样，她开始不再感到难过，并且认为他是一个令人讨厌的人，应该承受发生在他身上的一切。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
And she turned her face toward the streaming panes of the window of the railway
carriage and gazed out at the gray rain-storm which looked as if it would go on
forever and ever. She watched it so long and steadily that the grayness grew
heavier and heavier before her eyes and she fell asleep.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">她把脸转向铁路客车的窗玻璃，凝视着外面的灰色暴风雨，看起来好像它将永远持续下去。她看了很久很久，渐渐地，眼前的灰色越来越重，她睡着了。</p>

ACROSS THE MOOR<font class="cyxy-trs-target"> 穿过沼地</font></h2>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
She slept a long time, and when she awakened Mrs. Medlock had bought a
lunchbasket at one of the stations and they had some chicken and cold beef and
bread and butter and some hot tea. The rain seemed to be streaming down more
heavily than ever and everybody in the station wore wet and glistening
waterproofs. The guard lighted the lamps in the carriage, and Mrs. Medlock
cheered up very much over her tea and chicken and beef. She ate a great deal
and afterward fell asleep herself, and Mary sat and stared at her and watched
her fine bonnet slip on one side until she herself fell asleep once more in the
corner of the carriage, lulled by the splashing of the rain against the
windows. It was quite dark when she awakened again. The train had stopped at a
station and Mrs. Medlock was shaking her.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">她睡了很长时间，当她醒来时，梅德洛克太太已经在一个车站买了一个午餐篮，他们吃了一些鸡肉和冷牛肉，面包和黄油，还有一些热茶。雨似乎比以往下得更大了，车站里的每个人都穿着湿漉漉的、闪闪发光的防水衣。卫兵点亮了马车上的灯，梅德洛克太太喝着茶，吃着鸡肉和牛肉，非常高兴。她吃了很多东西，然后自己也睡着了，玛丽坐在那里盯着她，看着她漂亮的帽子滑到一边，直到她自己在马车的角落里又睡着了，被雨水打在窗户上打得昏昏欲睡。当她再次醒来时，天已经很黑了。火车在一个车站停了下来，梅德洛克太太在摇晃她。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“You have had a sleep!” she said. “It’s time to open
your eyes! We’re at Thwaite Station and we’ve got a long drive
before us.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“你睡过了!”她说。“是时候睁开眼睛了！我们在 Thwaite Station，还有很长的路要走。”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
Mary stood up and tried to keep her eyes open while Mrs. Medlock collected her
parcels. The little girl did not offer to help her, because in India native
servants always picked up or carried things and it seemed quite proper that
other people should wait on one.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">玛丽站起来，尽量睁大眼睛看着梅德洛克太太收拾她的包裹。这个小女孩没有主动帮助她，因为在印度，当地的仆人总是拿起或者搬运东西，而且似乎其他人应该伺候一个人是很合适的。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
The station was a small one and nobody but themselves seemed to be getting out
of the train. The station-master spoke to Mrs. Medlock in a rough, good-natured
way, pronouncing his words in a queer broad fashion which Mary found out
afterward was Yorkshire.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">车站很小，除了他们自己似乎没有人下车。站长用一种粗鲁、和蔼的方式和梅德洛克太太说话，用一种古怪、宽泛的方式发音，玛丽后来才知道他是约克郡人。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“I see tha’s got back,” he said. “An’ tha’s
browt th’ young ’un with thee.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“我看见你回来了,”他说，“你和你的小伙子在一起。”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“Aye, that’s her,” answered Mrs. Medlock, speaking with a
Yorkshire accent herself and jerking her head over her shoulder toward Mary.
“How’s thy Missus?”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“是的，就是她,”梅德洛克太太回答说，她自己也带着约克郡口音，把头从肩膀上向玛丽猛地一转。“你太太好吗?”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“Well enow. Th’ carriage is waitin’ outside for thee.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“好了，马车在外面等你呢”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
A brougham stood on the road before the little outside platform. Mary saw that
it was a smart carriage and that it was a smart footman who helped her in. His
long waterproof coat and the waterproof covering of his hat were shining and
dripping with rain as everything was, the burly station-master included.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">一辆四轮马车停在路上，停在外面的小站台前。玛丽看到那是一辆漂亮的马车，是一个聪明的男仆帮她上了车。他那件长长的防水外套和帽子的防水外套闪闪发光，滴着雨水，就像一切事物一样，包括身材魁梧的站长在内。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
When he shut the door, mounted the box with the coachman, and they drove off,
the little girl found herself seated in a comfortably cushioned corner, but she
was not inclined to go to sleep again. She sat and looked out of the window,
curious to see something of the road over which she was being driven to the
queer place Mrs. Medlock had spoken of. She was not at all a timid child and
she was not exactly frightened, but she felt that there was no knowing what
might happen in a house with a hundred rooms nearly all shut up—a house
standing on the edge of a moor.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">当他关上车门，和车夫一起上车，他们开车离开时，小女孩发现自己坐在一个舒适的角落里，但是她不想再睡觉了。她坐下来，向窗外望去，好奇地想看看她正被开往梅德洛克夫人所说的那个古怪地方的路。她并不是一个胆小的孩子，也不是真的害怕，但是她觉得在一个有一百个房间几乎全部关闭的房子里——一个位于荒原边缘的房子里，谁也不知道会发生什么。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“What is a moor?” she said suddenly to Mrs. Medlock.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“什么是沼地?”她突然对梅德洛克太太说。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“Look out of the window in about ten minutes and you’ll see,”
the woman answered. “We’ve got to drive five miles across Missel
Moor before we get to the Manor. You won’t see much because it’s a
dark night, but you can see something.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“再过十分钟你就会看到窗外了,”女人回答。“我们得开车5英里穿过 Missel Moor 才能到达庄园。你不会看到太多，因为这是一个黑暗的夜晚，但你可以看到一些东西。”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
Mary asked no more questions but waited in the darkness of her corner, keeping
her eyes on the window. The carriage lamps cast rays of light a little distance
ahead of them and she caught glimpses of the things they passed. After they had
left the station they had driven through a tiny village and she had seen
whitewashed cottages and the lights of a public house. Then they had passed a
church and a vicarage and a little shop-window or so in a cottage with toys and
sweets and odd things set out for sale. Then they were on the highroad and she
saw hedges and trees. After that there seemed nothing different for a long
time—or at least it seemed a long time to her.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">玛丽不再问任何问题，只是在黑暗的角落里等待着，眼睛一直盯着窗户。马车的灯光在他们前面不远处投射下来，她瞥见了他们经过的东西。离开火车站后，他们驱车穿过一个小村庄，她看到了粉刷成白色的小屋和一家酒馆的灯光。然后，他们经过了一座教堂，一间牧师住宅，还有一间小屋里的一个小商店橱窗，里面摆满了待售的玩具、糖果和一些奇怪的东西。然后他们在公路上，她看到了树篱和树木。在那之后很长一段时间里，似乎没有什么不同ーー或者至少在她看来是很长一段时间。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
At last the horses began to go more slowly, as if they were climbing up-hill,
and presently there seemed to be no more hedges and no more trees. She could
see nothing, in fact, but a dense darkness on either side. She leaned forward
and pressed her face against the window just as the carriage gave a big jolt.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">最后，马儿们开始走得更慢了，好像它们正在向山上爬，不一会儿，树篱和树木似乎都不见了。事实上，她什么也看不见，只能看见两边浓密的黑暗。她身子前倾，把脸贴在车窗上，这时马车猛地一震。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“Eh! We’re on the moor now sure enough,” said Mrs. Medlock.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“哎! 我们现在果然到沼地上了,”梅德洛克太太说。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
The carriage lamps shed a yellow light on a rough-looking road which seemed to
be cut through bushes and low-growing things which ended in the great expanse
of dark apparently spread out before and around them. A wind was rising and
making a singular, wild, low, rushing sound.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">车灯在一条粗糙的道路上发出黄色的光，这条道路似乎穿过了灌木丛和矮小的东西，最后变成了一大片黑暗，显然是在他们的前面和周围蔓延开来的。一阵风正在升起，发出一种奇异的、狂野的、低沉的、急促的声音。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“It’s—it’s not the sea, is it?” said Mary,
looking round at her companion.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“这不是大海，对吗?”玛丽环顾四周，说道。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“No, not it,” answered Mrs. Medlock. “Nor it isn’t
fields nor mountains, it’s just miles and miles and miles of wild land
that nothing grows on but heather and gorse and broom, and nothing lives on but
wild ponies and sheep.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“不，不是它,”梅德洛克太太回答。“也不是田野和山脉，而是绵延数英里的荒野，除了石南、金雀花和扫帚，什么也不长，除了野马和绵羊，什么也不长。”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“I feel as if it might be the sea, if there were water on it,” said
Mary. “It sounds like the sea just now.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“我觉得好像是大海，如果上面有水的话,”玛丽说。“听起来像刚才的大海。”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“That’s the wind blowing through the bushes,” Mrs. Medlock
said. “It’s a wild, dreary enough place to my mind, though
there’s plenty that likes it—particularly when the heather’s
in bloom.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“那是穿过灌木丛的风,”梅德洛克太太说。“对我来说，这是一个荒凉的地方，尽管有很多人喜欢这里ーー尤其是在石南花开的时候。”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
On and on they drove through the darkness, and though the rain stopped, the
wind rushed by and whistled and made strange sounds. The road went up and down,
and several times the carriage passed over a little bridge beneath which water
rushed very fast with a great deal of noise. Mary felt as if the drive would
never come to an end and that the wide, bleak moor was a wide expanse of black
ocean through which she was passing on a strip of dry land.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">他们继续在黑暗中行驶，尽管雨停了，风还是呼啸而过，发出奇怪的声音。这条路上下颠簸，马车几次经过一座小桥，桥下水流湍急，声音很大。玛丽觉得这样的旅程似乎永远不会结束，那广阔、荒凉的沼泽就是一片黑色的大海，她正穿过这片大海，走在一片干燥的陆地上。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“I don’t like it,” she said to herself. “I don’t
like it,” and she pinched her thin lips more tightly together.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“我不喜欢这样,”她对自己说。“我不喜欢这样,”她把薄薄的嘴唇紧紧地抿在一起。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
The horses were climbing up a hilly piece of road when she first caught sight
of a light. Mrs. Medlock saw it as soon as she did and drew a long sigh of
relief.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">当她第一次看到一盏灯的时候，马正在爬上一段山路。梅德洛克太太一看见就松了一口气。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“Eh, I am glad to see that bit o’ light twinkling,” she
exclaimed. “It’s the light in the lodge window. We shall get a good
cup of tea after a bit, at all events.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“哎，我很高兴看到那一点点亮光在闪烁,”她叫道。”是小屋窗户里的光。无论如何，过一会儿我们要喝杯好茶。”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
It was “after a bit,” as she said, for when the carriage passed
through the park gates there was still two miles of avenue to drive through and
the trees (which nearly met overhead) made it seem as if they were driving
through a long dark vault.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">正如她所说，“过了一会儿”，因为当马车通过公园大门时，还有两英里的林荫大道可以通过，树木(几乎在头顶上相遇)使它们看起来好像正在驶过一个长长的黑暗的拱顶。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
They drove out of the vault into a clear space and stopped before an immensely
long but low-built house which seemed to ramble round a stone court. At first
Mary thought that there were no lights at all in the windows, but as she got
out of the carriage she saw that one room in a corner upstairs showed a dull
glow.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">他们驱车驶出金库，来到一个空旷的地方，在一座极长但建筑低矮的房子前停了下来，这座房子似乎在一个石头庭院周围漫步。起初玛丽以为窗户里根本没有灯光，但是当她走出马车时，她看到楼上角落里的一个房间发出暗淡的光。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
The entrance door was a huge one made of massive, curiously shaped panels of
oak studded with big iron nails and bound with great iron bars. It opened into
an enormous hall, which was so dimly lighted that the faces in the portraits on
the walls and the figures in the suits of armor made Mary feel that she did not
want to look at them. As she stood on the stone floor she looked a very small,
odd little black figure, and she felt as small and lost and odd as she looked.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">入口大门是一个巨大的，由巨大的，奇形怪状的橡木镶板制成，镶嵌着巨大的铁钉，用巨大的铁条捆绑着。它通向一个巨大的大厅，灯光昏暗，墙上的肖像画和穿着盔甲的人物让玛丽觉得她不想看到他们。当她站在石头地板上的时候，她看起来是一个非常小，奇怪的小黑影，她觉得自己和她看起来一样小，一样迷茫，一样奇怪。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
A neat, thin old man stood near the manservant who opened the door for them.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">一个干净瘦削的老人站在为他们开门的男仆旁边。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“You are to take her to her room,” he said in a husky voice.
“He doesn’t want to see her. He’s going to London in the
morning.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“你带她去她的房间,”他用沙哑的声音说。他不想见她。他明早要去伦敦。”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“Very well, Mr. Pitcher,” Mrs. Medlock answered. “So long as
I know what’s expected of me, I can manage.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“很好，皮彻先生,”梅德洛克太太回答，“只要我知道别人对我的期望是什么，我就能应付得来。”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“What’s expected of you, Mrs. Medlock,” Mr. Pitcher said,
“is that you make sure that he’s not disturbed and that he
doesn’t see what he doesn’t want to see.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“梅德洛克太太，我们对你的期望是,”皮彻先生说，“你要确保他不会被打扰，他不会看到他不想看到的东西。”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
And then Mary Lennox was led up a broad staircase and down a long corridor and
up a short flight of steps and through another corridor and another, until a
door opened in a wall and she found herself in a room with a fire in it and a
supper on a table.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">然后玛丽 · 伦诺克斯被领上一个宽阔的楼梯下了一条长长的走廊又上了一小段台阶又穿过另一条走廊又穿过另一条走廊直到墙上的一扇门打开她发现自己在一个房间里，房间里有炉火，桌子上有晚餐。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
Mrs. Medlock said unceremoniously:
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">梅德洛克夫人毫不客气地说:</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“Well, here you are! This room and the next are where you’ll
live—and you must keep to them. Don’t you forget that!”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“好吧，你在这里！这个房间和下一个房间就是你住的地方ーー你必须住在这两个房间里。别忘了这一点!”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
It was in this way Mistress Mary arrived at Misselthwaite Manor and she had
perhaps never felt quite so contrary in all her life.

MARTHA</h2>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
When she opened her eyes in the morning it was because a young housemaid had
come into her room to light the fire and was kneeling on the hearth-rug raking
out the cinders noisily. Mary lay and watched her for a few moments and then
began to look about the room. She had never seen a room at all like it and
thought it curious and gloomy. The walls were covered with tapestry with a
forest scene embroidered on it. There were fantastically dressed people under
the trees and in the distance there was a glimpse of the turrets of a castle.
There were hunters and horses and dogs and ladies. Mary felt as if she were in
the forest with them. Out of a deep window she could see a great climbing
stretch of land which seemed to have no trees on it, and to look rather like an
endless, dull, purplish sea.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">早上她睁开眼睛的时候，是因为一个年轻的女佣走进她的房间生火，跪在壁炉边的地毯上，大声地刨着煤渣。玛丽躺下来看了她一会儿，然后开始环顾房间。她从来没有见过像这样的房间，觉得奇怪而阴郁。墙上挂满了绣有森林景色的挂毯。树下站着衣着华丽的人们，远处可以瞥见一座城堡的塔楼。有猎人，有马，有狗，还有女人。玛丽觉得自己好像和他们一起在森林里。透过一扇深深的窗户，她可以看到一大片向上攀爬的土地，上面似乎没有树木，看上去更像是一片无边无际、暗淡无光的紫色大海。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“What is that?” she said, pointing out of the window.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“那是什么?”她指着窗外说。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
Martha, the young housemaid, who had just risen to her feet, looked and pointed
also.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">玛莎，那个刚刚站起来的年轻女仆，也看了看，指了指。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“That there?” she said.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“那个吗?”她说。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“Yes.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“是的。”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“That’s th’ moor,” with a good-natured grin.
“Does tha’ like it?”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“那就是摩尔人,”他和蔼地咧嘴一笑，“你喜欢吗?”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“No,” answered Mary. “I hate it.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“不,”玛丽回答，“我讨厌它。”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“That’s because tha’rt not used to it,” Martha said,
going back to her hearth. “Tha’ thinks it’s too big an’
bare now. But tha’ will like it.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“那是因为你不习惯,”玛莎说着，回到了她的壁炉边。“你觉得它太大了，现在光秃秃的”。但你会喜欢的”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“Do you?” inquired Mary.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“是吗?”玛丽问。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“Aye, that I do,” answered Martha, cheerfully polishing away at the
grate. “I just love it. It’s none bare. It’s covered
wi’ growin’ things as smells sweet. It’s fair lovely in
spring an’ summer when th’ gorse an’ broom an’
heather’s in flower. It smells o’ honey an’ there’s
such a lot o’ fresh air—an’ th’ sky looks so high
an’ th’ bees an’ skylarks makes such a nice noise
hummin’ an’ singin’. Eh! I wouldn’t live away from
th’ moor for anythin’.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“是的，我知道,”玛莎回答，兴高采烈地擦着壁炉。我就是喜欢。不是空的。上面长满了香气扑鼻的植物。在春天和夏天，金雀花、扫帚和石南花开得很好。这里有蜂蜜的味道，空气清新，天空看起来很高，蜜蜂和云雀发出悦耳的声音，嗡嗡地唱着歌。呃！我不会为了任何东西离开沼泽地</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
Mary listened to her with a grave, puzzled expression. The native servants she
had been used to in India were not in the least like this. They were obsequious
and servile and did not presume to talk to their masters as if they were their
equals. They made salaams and called them “protector of the poor”
and names of that sort. Indian servants were commanded to do things, not asked.
It was not the custom to say “please” and “thank you”
and Mary had always slapped her Ayah in the face when she was angry. She
wondered a little what this girl would do if one slapped her in the face. She
was a round, rosy, good-natured looking creature, but she had a sturdy way
which made Mistress Mary wonder if she might not even slap back—if the
person who slapped her was only a little girl.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">玛丽带着一种严肃、困惑的表情听她说话。她在印度所习惯的当地仆人一点也不像这样。他们卑躬屈膝，卑躬屈膝，不敢和他们的主人说话，好像他们是平等的。他们称呼他们为“穷人的保护者”和诸如此类的名字。印第安仆人被命令做事，而不是被要求。说“请”和“谢谢”并不是一种习俗，玛丽生气的时候总是扇阿亚的耳光。她有点想知道，如果有人扇她耳光，这个女孩会怎么做。她是一个圆圆的，红润的，善良的生物，但她有一个坚定的方式，使玛丽小姐怀疑她可能甚至不扇回去ー如果打她的人只是一个小女孩。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“You are a strange servant,” she said from her pillows, rather

“Eh! I know that,” she said. “If there was a grand Missus at
Misselthwaite I should never have been even one of th’ under housemaids.
I might have been let to be scullerymaid but I’d never have been let
upstairs. I’m too common an’ I talk too much Yorkshire. But this is
a funny house for all it’s so grand. Seems like there’s neither
Master nor Mistress except Mr. Pitcher an’ Mrs. Medlock. Mr. Craven, he
won’t be troubled about anythin’ when he’s here, an’
he’s nearly always away. Mrs. Medlock gave me th’ place out

had been like other big houses.”

“Well,” said Martha, evidently not in the least aware that she was
impudent, “it’s time tha’ should learn. Tha’ cannot

“Eh! I can see it’s different,” she answered almost

</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“呃！我可以看出它的不同,”她几乎同情地回答。“我敢说，这是因为那里有很多黑人，而不是受人尊敬的白人。当我听说你从印度来的时候，我以为你也是个黑人。”</p>

black’s a man an’ a brother. I’ve never seen a black

I come in to light your fire this mornin’ I crep’ up to your bed

She was in such a rage and felt so helpless before the girl’s simple
stare, and somehow she suddenly felt so horribly lonely and far away from
everything she understood and which understood her, that she threw herself face
downward on the pillows and burst into passionate sobbing. She sobbed so
unrestrainedly that good-natured Yorkshire Martha was a little frightened and
quite sorry for her. She went to the bed and bent over her.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">在女孩简单的注视下，她是如此的愤怒，如此的无助，不知怎么的，她突然感到如此可怕的孤独，远离了她所理解的一切，她把自己的脸朝下放在枕头上，发出激情的啜泣。她无法控制地抽泣着，心地善良的约克郡玛莎有点害怕，为她感到难过。她走到床边，俯下身来。</p>

“These are th’ ones tha’ must put on,” Martha answered.
“Mr. Craven ordered Mrs. Medlock to get ’em in London. He said
‘I won’t have a child dressed in black wanderin’ about like a

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
The dressing process was one which taught them both something. Martha had
“buttoned up” her little sisters and brothers but she had never
seen a child who stood still and waited for another person to do things for her
as if she had neither hands nor feet of her own.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">穿衣过程教会了他们一些东西。玛莎已经把她的小妹妹和弟弟们“关起来”了，但是她从来没有见过一个孩子站着不动，等着别人为她做事，好像她自己没有手也没有脚一样。</p>

“Why doesn’t tha’ put on tha’ own shoes?” she
said when Mary quietly held out her foot.

“My Ayah did it,” answered Mary, staring. “It was the

</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“是我的阿亚干的,”玛丽瞪着眼睛回答，“这是习俗。”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
She said that very often—“It was the custom.” The native
servants were always saying it. If one told them to do a thing their ancestors
had not done for a thousand years they gazed at one mildly and said, “It
is not the custom” and one knew that was the end of the matter.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">她经常这么说ーー“这是习俗。”当地的仆人总是这么说。如果有人告诉他们去做一件他们的祖先一千年都没有做过的事情，他们会温和地盯着一个人说，“这不是习俗”，而且人们知道这件事就这样结束了。</p>

It had not been the custom that Mistress Mary should do anything but stand and
allow herself to be dressed like a doll, but before she was ready for breakfast
she began to suspect that her life at Misselthwaite Manor would end by teaching
her a number of things quite new to her—things such as putting on her own
shoes and stockings, and picking up things she let fall. If Martha had been a
well-trained fine young lady’s maid she would have been more subservient
and respectful and would have known that it was her business to brush hair, and
button boots, and pick things up and lay them away. She was, however, only an
untrained Yorkshire rustic who had been brought up in a moorland cottage with a
swarm of little brothers and sisters who had never dreamed of doing anything
but waiting on themselves and on the younger ones who were either babies in
arms or just learning to totter about and tumble over things.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">按照惯例，玛丽小姐除了站着让自己穿得像个洋娃娃以外什么都不用做，但是在她准备吃早餐之前，她开始怀疑她在 Misselthwaite Manor 的生活会因为教给她一些对她来说很新鲜的东西而结束——比如穿上她自己的鞋子和袜子，捡起她掉下来的东西。如果玛莎是一个受过良好训练的优秀的年轻女仆，她会更加恭顺和尊重，并会知道这是她的业务，梳头发，扣靴子，捡起东西，并把它们放在一边。然而，她只是一个没有受过训练的约克郡乡下人，在一个荒原小屋里长大，身边有一群弟弟妹妹，他们从来没有想过要做任何事情，除了等待自己和年幼的孩子，他们或者是抱着婴儿，或者只是学会蹒跚而行，跌跌撞撞。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
If Mary Lennox had been a child who was ready to be amused she would perhaps
have laughed at Martha’s readiness to talk, but Mary only listened to her
coldly and wondered at her freedom of manner. At first she was not at all
interested, but gradually, as the girl rattled on in her good-tempered, homely
way, Mary began to notice what she was saying.

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“Eh! you should see ’em all,” she said. “There’s
twelve of us an’ my father only gets sixteen shilling a week. I can tell
you my mother’s put to it to get porridge for ’em all. They tumble
about on th’ moor an’ play there all day an’ mother says
th’ air of th’ moor fattens ’em. She says she believes they

“Where did he get it?” asked Mary.

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“He found it on th’ moor with its mother when it was a little one

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
Mary had never possessed an animal pet of her own and had always thought she
should like one. So she began to feel a slight interest in Dickon, and as she
had never before been interested in anyone but herself, it was the dawning of
a healthy sentiment. When she went into the room which had been made into a
nursery for her, she found that it was rather like the one she had slept in. It
was not a child’s room, but a grown-up person’s room, with gloomy
old pictures on the walls and heavy old oak chairs. A table in the center was
set with a good substantial breakfast. But she had always had a very small
appetite, and she looked with something more than indifference at the first
plate Martha set before her.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">玛丽从来没有过自己的动物宠物，她一直认为她应该喜欢一只。于是，她开始对狄肯产生了一丝兴趣，由于除了她自己以外，她从来没有对任何人感兴趣过，这是一种健康情绪的开端。当她走进那间为她改造成育儿室的房间时，她发现它很像她曾经睡过的那间。这不是一个孩子的房间，而是一个成年人的房间，墙上挂着阴郁的老照片和沉重的老橡木椅子。中间的一张桌子上摆着丰盛的早餐。但是她的胃口一直很小，她看着玛莎摆在她面前的第一个盘子，不仅仅是漠不关心。</p>

It was really this mention of Dickon which made Mary decide to go out, though
she was not aware of it. There would be, birds outside though there would not
be ponies or sheep. They would be different from the birds in India and it
might amuse her to look at them.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">正是这次提到狄肯，使玛丽决定出去，尽管她自己并不知道。外面会有鸟，但不会有小马或绵羊。它们与印度的鸟类不同，看着它们可能会使她感到有趣。</p>

“If tha’ goes round that way tha’ll come to th’

“There’s lots o’ flowers in summer-time, but there’s
nothin’ bloomin’ now.” She seemed to hesitate a second before
she added, “One of th’ gardens is locked up. No one has been in it
for ten years.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“如果你从那条路走，你就会走到花园里,”她指着灌木墙上的一扇门说。“夏天有很多花，但现在什么都不开了”她似乎犹豫了一秒钟，然后补充说: “其中一个花园被锁上了。已经有十年没有人进去过了。”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“Why?” asked Mary in spite of herself. Here was another locked door
added to the hundred in the strange house.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“为什么?”玛丽不由自主地问道。这个陌生的房子里的一百人里又多了一扇锁着的门。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“Mr. Craven had it shut when his wife died so sudden. He won’t let
no one go inside. It was her garden. He locked th’ door an’ dug a

</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">”克雷文先生的妻子突然去世，他就把门关上了。他不让任何人进去。那是她的花园。他锁上门，挖了个洞，把钥匙埋了。梅德洛克太太的铃响了，我得走了。”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
After she was gone Mary turned down the walk which led to the door in the
shrubbery. She could not help thinking about the garden which no one had been
into for ten years. She wondered what it would look like and whether there were
any flowers still alive in it. When she had passed through the shrubbery gate
she found herself in great gardens, with wide lawns and winding walks with
clipped borders. There were trees, and flower-beds, and evergreens clipped into
strange shapes, and a large pool with an old gray fountain in its midst. But
the flower-beds were bare and wintry and the fountain was not playing. This was
not the garden which was shut up. How could a garden be shut up? You could
always walk into a garden.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">玛丽走了以后，转身走向灌木丛中的那扇门。她不禁想起了那个十年来没有人去过的花园。她想知道它会是什么样子，里面是否还有鲜花。当她穿过灌木丛的大门时，她发现自己置身于一个巨大的花园里，那里有宽阔的草坪，蜿蜒的步道上有剪裁过的边界。那里有树木，有花坛，常青树被修剪成奇怪的形状，还有一个大水池，水池中央有一个古老的灰色喷泉。但是花坛光秃秃的，寒冷刺骨，喷泉也没有喷出水来。这不是被关起来的花园。一个花园怎么可能被关起来？你可以随时走进花园。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
She was just thinking this when she saw that, at the end of the path she was
following, there seemed to be a long wall, with ivy growing over it. She was
not familiar enough with England to know that she was coming upon the
kitchen-gardens where the vegetables and fruit were growing. She went toward
the wall and found that there was a green door in the ivy, and that it stood
open. This was not the closed garden, evidently, and she could go into it.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">她正这样想着，突然看到，在她所走的小路的尽头，似乎有一堵长长的墙，上面长满了常春藤。她对英格兰还不够熟悉，所以不知道她是来到菜园里，那里正在种植蔬菜和水果。她走到墙边，发现常春藤上有一扇绿色的门，门是开着的。这显然不是那个封闭的花园，她可以走进去。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
She went through the door and found that it was a garden with walls all round
it and that it was only one of several walled gardens which seemed to open into
one another. She saw another open green door, revealing bushes and pathways
between beds containing winter vegetables. Fruit-trees were trained flat
against the wall, and over some of the beds there were glass frames. The place
was bare and ugly enough, Mary thought, as she stood and stared about her. It
might be nicer in summer when things were green, but there was nothing pretty
about it now.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">她穿过那扇门，发现那是一个花园，四周都是围墙，它只是几个似乎相互通向对方的围墙花园中的一个。她看到了另一扇打开的绿色大门，露出了床与床之间的灌木丛和小径，里面种着冬天的蔬菜。果树靠着墙平整地栽种着，在一些床的上方有玻璃框架。当玛丽站在那里凝视四周时，她想，这地方已经够荒凉够丑陋了。夏天绿意盎然的时候可能会更好，但是现在一点也不好看了。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
Presently an old man with a spade over his shoulder walked through the door
leading from the second garden. He looked startled when he saw Mary, and then
touched his cap. He had a surly old face, and did not seem at all pleased to
see her—but then she was displeased with his garden and wore her
“quite contrary” expression, and certainly did not seem at all
pleased to see him.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">不一会儿，一个肩上扛着铁锹的老人从第二个花园的门口走了进来。他看到玛丽时吓了一跳，然后摸了摸帽子。他有一张阴沉的老脸，似乎一点也不高兴见到她ーー但是她对他的花园不满意，脸上带着“相当反常”的表情，而且看起来肯定一点也不高兴见到他。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“What is this place?” she asked.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“这是什么地方?”她问。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“One o’ th’ kitchen-gardens,” he answered.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“一个菜园,”他回答。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“What is that?” said Mary, pointing through the other green door.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“那是什么?”玛丽指着另一扇绿色的门问。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“Another of ’em,” shortly. “There’s another on
t’other side o’ th’ wall an’ there’s th’
orchard t’other side o’ that.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“还有一个,”简短地说，“墙的另一边还有一个，墙的另一边还有一个果园。”</p>

</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“如果你喜欢的话，但是没什么好看的”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
Mary made no response. She went down the path and through the second green
door. There, she found more walls and winter vegetables and glass frames, but
in the second wall there was another green door and it was not open. Perhaps it
led into the garden which no one had seen for ten years. As she was not at all
a timid child and always did what she wanted to do, Mary went to the green door
and turned the handle. She hoped the door would not open because she wanted to
be sure she had found the mysterious garden—but it did open quite easily
and she walked through it and found herself in an orchard. There were walls all
round it also and trees trained against them, and there were bare fruit-trees
growing in the winter-browned grass—but there was no green door to be
seen anywhere. Mary looked for it, and yet when she had entered the upper end
of the garden she had noticed that the wall did not seem to end with the
orchard but to extend beyond it as if it enclosed a place at the other side.
She could see the tops of trees above the wall, and when she stood still she
saw a bird with a bright red breast sitting on the topmost branch of one of
them, and suddenly he burst into his winter song—almost as if he had
caught sight of her and was calling to her.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">玛丽没有回答。她沿着小路走，穿过第二扇绿色的门。在那里，她发现了更多的墙壁，冬天的蔬菜和玻璃框架，但在第二面墙上有另一扇绿色的门，它没有打开。也许它通向那个十年没人见过的花园。由于玛丽一点也不胆小，总是想做什么就做什么，她走到绿色的门前，转动了门把手。她希望门不要打开，因为她想确定她已经找到了那个神秘的花园ーー但是它确实很容易打开，她穿过它，发现自己在一个果园里。四周也有围墙，树木对着围墙，还有光秃秃的果树——生长在冬天枯黄的草地上——但是到处都看不到绿色的门。玛丽四处寻找，可是当她走进花园的上端时，她发现那堵墙似乎并没有到果园的尽头，而是延伸到了果园之外，好像它在另一边围住了一个地方。她可以看到墙上的树梢，当她站着不动的时候，她看到一只胸部鲜红的小鸟坐在其中一棵树的最上面的树枝上，突然，它放声唱起了冬天的歌——好像它看到了她，正在呼唤她。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
She stopped and listened to him and somehow his cheerful, friendly little
whistle gave her a pleased feeling—even a disagreeable little girl may be
lonely, and the big closed house and big bare moor and big bare gardens had
made this one feel as if there was no one left in the world but herself. If she
had been an affectionate child, who had been used to being loved, she would
have broken her heart, but even though she was “Mistress Mary Quite
Contrary” she was desolate, and the bright-breasted little bird brought a
look into her sour little face which was almost a smile. She listened to him
until he flew away. He was not like an Indian bird and she liked him and
wondered if she should ever see him again. Perhaps he lived in the mysterious
garden and knew all about it.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">她停下来听他说话，不知怎么地，他那欢快友好的小哨子给了她一种快乐的感觉ーー即使是一个不讨人喜欢的小女孩也可能会感到孤独，那所大大的封闭的房子、大大的裸露的荒原和大大的裸露的花园让这个人感觉世界上除了她自己没有别人了。如果她是一个多情的孩子，一个习惯了被爱的孩子，她一定会伤心欲绝，但是即使她是“玛丽小姐，相当相反”，她也是孤独的，那只胸脯鲜亮的小鸟看着她酸溜溜的小脸，几乎带着一丝笑意。她一直听他说，直到他飞走。他不像一只印度鸟，她喜欢他，不知道她是否还会再见到他。也许他住在那个神秘的花园里，知道这一切。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
Perhaps it was because she had nothing whatever to do that she thought so much
of the deserted garden. She was curious about it and wanted to see what it was
like. Why had Mr. Archibald Craven buried the key? If he had liked his wife so
much why did he hate her garden? She wondered if she should ever see him, but
she knew that if she did she should not like him, and he would not like her,
and that she should only stand and stare at him and say nothing, though she
should be wanting dreadfully to ask him why he had done such a queer thing.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">也许是因为她无事可做，所以她才对这个空荡荡的花园念念不忘。她对此很好奇，想看看它是什么样子的。为什么 Archibald Craven 先生要把钥匙埋起来？如果他那么喜欢他的妻子，为什么他讨厌她的花园呢？她不知道自己是否还能见到他，但她知道如果见到了，她就不会喜欢他，他也不会喜欢她，她只能站在那里，盯着他，什么也不说，尽管她应该很想问问他为什么做了这么奇怪的事情。</p>

“People never like me and I never like people,” she thought.

She thought of the robin and of the way he seemed to sing his song at her, and
as she remembered the tree-top he perched on she stopped rather suddenly on the
path.

She walked back into the first kitchen-garden she had entered and found the old

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
To her surprise the surly old weather-beaten face actually changed its
expression. A slow smile spread over it and the gardener looked quite
different. It made her think that it was curious how much nicer a person looked

</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">令她惊讶的是，那张饱经风霜的阴沉老脸实际上改变了它的表情。一个缓慢的微笑展开了它和园丁看起来完全不同。这让她觉得很奇怪，一个人微笑的时候看起来有多好。她以前从来没有想过这个问题。</p>

He turned about to the orchard side of his garden and began to whistle—a
low soft whistle. She could not understand how such a surly man could make such
a coaxing sound.

The bird put his tiny head on one side and looked up at him with his soft
bright eye which was like a black dewdrop. He seemed quite familiar and not the
least afraid. He hopped about and pecked the earth briskly, looking for seeds
and insects. It actually gave Mary a queer feeling in her heart, because he was
so pretty and cheerful and seemed so like a person. He had a tiny plump body
and a delicate beak, and slender delicate legs.

</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“塔和我有点像,”他说。“我们是用同一块布编织而成的。我们都不好看，我们都像我们看起来一样酸。我敢保证，我们俩的脾气都一样坏。”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
This was plain speaking, and Mary Lennox had never heard the truth about
herself in her life. Native servants always salaamed and submitted to you,
whatever you did. She had never thought much about her looks, but she wondered
if she was as unattractive as Ben Weatherstaff and she also wondered if she
looked as sour as he had looked before the robin came. She actually began to
wonder also if she was “nasty tempered.” She felt uncomfortable.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">说白了，玛丽 · 伦诺克斯从来没有听说过关于她自己的真相。不管你做什么，当地的仆人总是向你致敬，向你投降。她从来没有想过自己的外表，但是她想知道自己是否像本 · 韦瑟斯塔夫那样没有吸引力，她也想知道自己看起来是否像知更鸟来之前他看起来那样酸溜溜的。事实上，她也开始怀疑自己是否“脾气暴躁”她觉得不舒服。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
Suddenly a clear rippling little sound broke out near her and she turned round.
She was standing a few feet from a young apple-tree and the robin had flown on
to one of its branches and had burst out into a scrap of a song. Ben
Weatherstaff laughed outright.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">突然，她身边传来一阵清脆的声响，她转过身来。她站在离一棵小苹果树几英尺远的地方，知更鸟已经飞到了它的一根树枝上，发出一阵歌声。本 · 韦瑟斯塔夫哈哈大笑。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“What did he do that for?” asked Mary.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“他那样做是为了什么?”玛丽问。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“He’s made up his mind to make friends with thee,” replied
Ben. “Dang me if he hasn’t took a fancy to thee.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“他已经下定决心要和你交朋友了,”本回答说。“如果他不喜欢你，我就去死吧”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“To me?” said Mary, and she moved toward the little tree softly and
looked up.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“对我?”玛丽说，她轻轻地走向那棵小树，抬起头来。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“Would you make friends with me?” she said to the robin just as if
she was speaking to a person. “Would you?” And she did not say it
either in her hard little voice or in her imperious Indian voice, but in a tone
so soft and eager and coaxing that Ben Weatherstaff was as surprised as she had
been when she heard him whistle.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“你愿意和我交朋友吗?”她对知更鸟说，就好像她在对一个人说话。“你会吗?”她说话的声音既不尖锐，也不傲慢，既不尖锐，也不专横，而是用一种温柔、渴望和哄骗的语调，以至于本 · 韦瑟斯塔夫听到他吹口哨的时候，还是和以前一样吃惊。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“Why,” he cried out, “tha’ said that as nice an’
human as if tha’ was a real child instead of a sharp old woman.
Tha’ said it almost like Dickon talks to his wild things on th’
moor.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“为什么,”他大声说，“你说得好像你是一个真正的孩子，而不是一个尖锐的老妇人。你说得好像迪肯在荒原上和他的野兽说话一样</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“Do you know Dickon?” Mary asked, turning round rather in a hurry.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“你认识狄肯吗?”玛丽问，急忙转过身来。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“Everybody knows him. Dickon’s wanderin’ about everywhere.
Th’ very blackberries an’ heather-bells knows him. I warrant
th’ foxes shows him where their cubs lies an’ th’ skylarks
doesn’t hide their nests from him.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“大家都认识他。迪肯到处乱跑。那些黑莓和石南花都认识他。我保证狐狸会告诉他它们的幼崽在哪里云雀也不会把巢藏起来</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
Mary would have liked to ask some more questions. She was almost as curious
about Dickon as she was about the deserted garden. But just that moment the
robin, who had ended his song, gave a little shake of his wings, spread them
and flew away. He had made his visit and had other things to do.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">玛丽想再问些问题。她对狄肯的好奇几乎和对那个荒废的花园一样。但就在那一刻，知更鸟结束了它的歌声，轻轻地摇了摇翅膀，展开翅膀飞走了。他已经来过了，还有别的事情要做。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“He has flown over the wall!” Mary cried out, watching him.
“He has flown into the orchard—he has flown across the other
wall—into the garden where there is no door!”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“他飞过了城墙!”玛丽看着他大叫起来。“他飞进了果园ーー他飞过了另一堵墙ーー飞进了没有门的花园!”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“He lives there,” said old Ben. “He came out o’
th’ egg there. If he’s courtin’, he’s makin’ up
to some young madam of a robin that lives among th’ old rose-trees
there.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“他住在那儿,”老本说。他从那个蛋里出来。如果他在求爱，那就是在向某个住在玫瑰花丛中的知更鸟的年轻夫人示好。”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“Rose-trees,” said Mary. “Are there rose-trees?”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“玫瑰树,”玛丽说，“有玫瑰树吗?”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
Ben Weatherstaff took up his spade again and began to dig.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">本 · 韦瑟斯塔夫又拿起他的铁锹开始挖起来。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“There was ten year’ ago,” he mumbled.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“那是十年前的事了,”他喃喃地说。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“I should like to see them,” said Mary. “Where is the green
door? There must be a door somewhere.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“我想看看他们,”玛丽说，“绿色的门在哪里? 一定有门的。”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
Ben drove his spade deep and looked as uncompanionable as he had looked when
she first saw him.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">本把他的铁锹深深地挖了一下，看起来就像她第一次见到他时他看起来那样孤僻。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“There was ten year’ ago, but there isn’t now,” he
said.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“十年前有，但现在没有了,”他说。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“No door!” cried Mary. “There must be.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“没有门!”玛丽喊道，“一定有的。”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“None as anyone can find, an’ none as is anyone’s business.
Don’t you be a meddlesome wench an’ poke your nose where it’s
no cause to go. Here, I must go on with my work. Get you gone an’ play
you. I’ve no more time.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“没有人能找到，没有人的业务。你这个爱管闲事的丫头，别管闲事。在这里，我必须继续我的工作。带你走，玩弄你。我没时间了”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
And he actually stopped digging, threw his spade over his shoulder and walked
off, without even glancing at her or saying good-by.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">他真的停止了挖掘，把铲子扛在肩上，走开了，甚至没有看她一眼，也没有说再见。</p>

THE CRY IN THE CORRIDOR<font class="cyxy-trs-target"> 走廊里的哭声</font></h2>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
At first each day which passed by for Mary Lennox was exactly like the others.
Every morning she awoke in her tapestried room and found Martha kneeling upon
the hearth building her fire; every morning she ate her breakfast in the
nursery which had nothing amusing in it; and after each breakfast she gazed out
of the window across to the huge moor which seemed to spread out on all sides
and climb up to the sky, and after she had stared for a while she realized that
if she did not go out she would have to stay in and do nothing—and so she
went out. She did not know that this was the best thing she could have done,
and she did not know that, when she began to walk quickly or even run along the
paths and down the avenue, she was stirring her slow blood and making herself
stronger by fighting with the wind which swept down from the moor. She ran only
to make herself warm, and she hated the wind which rushed at her face and
roared and held her back as if it were some giant she could not see. But the
big breaths of rough fresh air blown over the heather filled her lungs with
something which was good for her whole thin body and whipped some red color
into her cheeks and brightened her dull eyes when she did not know anything
about it.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">起初，玛丽 · 伦诺克斯度过的每一天都和往常一模一样。每天早上，她在挂毯房间里醒来，发现玛莎正跪在壁炉边生火; 每天早上，她都在育儿室里吃早餐，里面没有什么有趣的东西; 每次吃完早餐，她就从窗户望出去，看到四面八方都是巨大的沼泽，那沼泽似乎正在向天空攀升。盯着看了一会儿后，她意识到，如果她不出去，她就只能呆在家里什么也不做——于是她出去了。她不知道这是她能做的最好的事情，她不知道，当她开始快步走，甚至沿着小路和大街奔跑时，她正在激起她缓慢的血液，通过与从沼泽地吹来的风作斗争使自己变得更强壮。她跑步只是为了取暖，她讨厌迎面而来的风，它咆哮着把她拉回来，好像它是什么她看不见的巨人。但是吹过石南花的粗重的新鲜空气使她的肺部充满了对她整个瘦小的身体有益的东西，使她的脸颊变得红润，当她不知道这件事的时候，使她呆滞的眼睛变得明亮起来。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
But after a few days spent almost entirely out of doors she wakened one morning
knowing what it was to be hungry, and when she sat down to her breakfast she
did not glance disdainfully at her porridge and push it away, but took up her
spoon and began to eat it and went on eating it until her bowl was empty.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">但是在几天几乎完全不在家的日子之后，一天早上她醒来，知道饥饿是什么滋味。当她坐下来吃早餐时，她没有轻蔑地瞥一眼粥，把它推开，而是拿起勺子，开始吃，一直吃到碗空为止。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“Tha’ got on well enough with that this mornin’, didn’t
tha’?” said Martha.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“今天早上你们相处得不错，是吗?”玛莎说。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“It tastes nice today,” said Mary, feeling a little surprised
herself.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“今天味道不错,”玛丽说，自己也有点吃惊。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“It’s th’ air of th’ moor that’s givin’
thee stomach for tha’ victuals,” answered Martha. “It’s
lucky for thee that tha’s got victuals as well as appetite. There’s
been twelve in our cottage as had th’ stomach an’ nothin’ to
put in it. You go on playin’ you out o’ doors every day an’
you’ll get some flesh on your bones an’ you won’t be so
yeller.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“是沼泽的空气让你有胃口吃东西,”玛莎回答。“你很幸运，有食物，也有胃口”。我们的小屋里有十二个人，他们的胃里什么都没有。你继续每天在外面玩你的游戏，你的骨头上会有一些肉，你就不会这么大声嚷嚷了。”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“I don’t play,” said Mary. “I have nothing to play
with.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“我不玩,”玛丽说，“我没什么可玩的。”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“Nothin’ to play with!” exclaimed Martha. “Our children
plays with sticks and stones. They just runs about an’ shouts an’
looks at things.” Mary did not shout, but she looked at things. There was
nothing else to do. She walked round and round the gardens and wandered about
the paths in the park. Sometimes she looked for Ben Weatherstaff, but though
several times she saw him at work he was too busy to look at her or was too
surly. Once when she was walking toward him he picked up his spade and turned
away as if he did it on purpose.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“没什么好玩的!”玛莎叫道。我们的孩子玩棍子和石头。他们只是跑来跑去，大喊大叫，看着东西。”玛丽没有大喊大叫，但她看着东西。没别的办法了。她在花园里走来走去，在公园里的小路上漫步。有时候她会去找本 · 韦瑟斯塔夫，但是有几次她在工作的时候看到他，他都忙得没时间看她，或者是太生气了。有一次，当她向他走来时，他拿起铁锹转过身去，好像是故意的。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
One place she went to oftener than to any other. It was the long walk outside
the gardens with the walls round them. There were bare flower-beds on either
side of it and against the walls ivy grew thickly. There was one part of the
wall where the creeping dark green leaves were more bushy than elsewhere. It
seemed as if for a long time that part had been neglected. The rest of it had
been clipped and made to look neat, but at this lower end of the walk it had
not been trimmed at all.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">一个她最常去的地方。那是在花园外面长长的步行，花园四周围着围墙。两边都是光秃秃的花坛，墙上爬满了茂密的常春藤。墙的一部分比其他地方爬行的深绿色的叶子更茂密。这部分似乎被忽视了很长一段时间。其余的部分已经修剪过，看起来很整齐，但是在这条小路的尽头，它一点也没有被修剪过。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
A few days after she had talked to Ben Weatherstaff, Mary stopped to notice
this and wondered why it was so. She had just paused and was looking up at a
long spray of ivy swinging in the wind when she saw a gleam of scarlet and
heard a brilliant chirp, and there, on the top of the wall, perched Ben
Weatherstaff’s robin redbreast, tilting forward to look at her with his
small head on one side.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">和本 · 韦瑟斯塔夫谈过几天之后，玛丽停下来注意到了这一点，她想知道为什么会这样。她刚刚停了下来，正抬头看着长长的常春藤在风中摇摆，这时她看到了一束猩红色的光芒，听到了一声明亮的啁啾。在墙的顶端，本 · 韦瑟斯塔夫(Ben Weatherstaff)的红胸知更鸟栖息在那里，向前倾着小脑袋看着她。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“Oh!” she cried out, “is it you—is it you?” And
it did not seem at all queer to her that she spoke to him as if she were sure
that he would understand and answer her.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“哦!”她喊道: “是你吗? 是你吗?”她对他说话，好像她确信他会理解并回答她似的，她一点也不觉得奇怪。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
He did answer. He twittered and chirped and hopped along the wall as if he were
telling her all sorts of things. It seemed to Mistress Mary as if she
understood him, too, though he was not speaking in words. It was as if he said:
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">他接了。他叽叽喳喳地在墙上跳来跳去，好像在告诉她各种各样的事情。玛丽太太似乎也明白他的意思，尽管他没有说话。就好像他说:</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“Good morning! Isn’t the wind nice? Isn’t the sun nice?
Isn’t everything nice? Let us both chirp and hop and twitter. Come on!
Come on!”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“早上好！风不错吧？太阳不错吧？一切都不错吧？让我们一起叽叽喳喳。来吧！来吧!”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
Mary began to laugh, and as he hopped and took little flights along the wall
she ran after him. Poor little thin, sallow, ugly Mary—she actually
looked almost pretty for a moment.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">玛丽开始大笑起来，当他在墙上蹦蹦跳跳的时候，她追了上去。可怜的瘦弱、憔悴、丑陋的玛丽ーー有那么一会儿，她看上去几乎是美丽的。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“I like you! I like you!” she cried out, pattering down the walk;
and she chirped and tried to whistle, which last she did not know how to do in
the least. But the robin seemed to be quite satisfied and chirped and whistled
back at her. At last he spread his wings and made a darting flight to the top
of a tree, where he perched and sang loudly.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“我喜欢你！我喜欢你!”她叫了起来，轻快地沿着小路走下去; 她叽叽喳喳地叫着，试着吹口哨，最后她一点儿也不知道怎么吹。但是知更鸟似乎很满意，并且对她鸣叫和吹口哨。最后，它展开翅膀，飞快地飞到一棵树的顶端，在那里它栖息着，大声地唱着歌。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
That reminded Mary of the first time she had seen him. He had been swinging on
a tree-top then and she had been standing in the orchard. Now she was on the
other side of the orchard and standing in the path outside a wall—much
lower down—and there was the same tree inside.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">这使玛丽想起了她第一次见到他的情景。那时他正在树顶上荡秋千，而她正站在果园里。现在，她站在果园的另一边，站在一堵墙外面的小路上ーー那堵墙要低得多ーー里面还是那棵树。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“It’s in the garden no one can go into,” she said to herself.
“It’s the garden without a door. He lives in there. How I wish I
could see what it is like!”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“它在花园里，没有人能进去,”她对自己说。这是没有门的花园。他住在里面。我多么希望我能看到它是什么样子!”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
She ran up the walk to the green door she had entered the first morning. Then
she ran down the path through the other door and then into the orchard, and
when she stood and looked up there was the tree on the other side of the wall,
and there was the robin just finishing his song and beginning to preen his
feathers with his beak.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">她跑上步道，来到她第一天早晨进来的那扇绿色的门前。然后她沿着小路跑过另一扇门，进入果园，当她站起来抬头看的时候，墙的另一边有一棵树，知更鸟刚刚唱完歌，开始用它的嘴梳理羽毛。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“It is the garden,” she said. “I am sure it is.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“这就是那个花园,”她说，“我敢肯定它就是。”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
She walked round and looked closely at that side of the orchard wall, but she
only found what she had found before—that there was no door in it. Then
she ran through the kitchen-gardens again and out into the walk outside the
long ivy-covered wall, and she walked to the end of it and looked at it, but
there was no door; and then she walked to the other end, looking again, but
there was no door.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">她绕了一圈，仔细地看了看果园墙的那一边，但她只发现了她以前发现的东西ーー那里没有门。然后她又跑过菜园，来到长满常春藤的墙外面的小路上，她走到墙的尽头看了看，但是没有门; 然后她又走到另一头，又看了看，但是没有门。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“It’s very queer,” she said. “Ben Weatherstaff said
there was no door and there is no door. But there must have been one ten years
ago, because Mr. Craven buried the key.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“这很奇怪,”她说。“ Ben Weatherstaff 说没有门，也没有门”。但是十年前肯定有一把因为克雷文先生把钥匙埋了</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
This gave her so much to think of that she began to be quite interested and
feel that she was not sorry that she had come to Misselthwaite Manor. In India
she had always felt hot and too languid to care much about anything. The fact
was that the fresh wind from the moor had begun to blow the cobwebs out of her
young brain and to waken her up a little.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">这给了她如此多的思考，以至于她开始非常感兴趣，觉得自己来到 Misselthwaite Manor 并不后悔。在印度的时候，她总是觉得很热，很疲惫，不在乎任何事情。事实上，来自沼地的清风已经开始把她年轻的大脑里的蜘蛛网吹散，使她稍微清醒了一点。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
She stayed out of doors nearly all day, and when she sat down to her supper at
night she felt hungry and drowsy and comfortable. She did not feel cross when
Martha chattered away. She felt as if she rather liked to hear her, and at last
she thought she would ask her a question. She asked it after she had finished
her supper and had sat down on the hearth-rug before the fire.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">她几乎一整天都待在外面，晚上坐下来吃晚饭时，她感到饥饿、昏昏欲睡、很舒服。玛莎喋喋不休时，她并不生气。她觉得自己好像很喜欢听她说话，最后她想问她一个问题。她吃完晚饭，在壁炉前的地毯上坐下来之后问道。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“Why did Mr. Craven hate the garden?” she said.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“为什么克雷文先生讨厌花园?”她说。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
She had made Martha stay with her and Martha had not objected at all. She was
very young, and used to a crowded cottage full of brothers and sisters, and she
found it dull in the great servants’ hall downstairs where the footman
and upper-housemaids made fun of her Yorkshire speech and looked upon her as a
common little thing, and sat and whispered among themselves. Martha liked to
talk, and the strange child who had lived in India, and been waited upon by
“blacks,” was novelty enough to attract her.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">她让玛莎和她住在一起，玛莎一点也没有反对。她还很年轻，习惯了一间挤满了兄弟姐妹的小屋。她觉得楼下的仆人大厅很无聊，仆人和上面的女仆取笑她在约克郡的讲话，把她当成一个普通的小东西，坐在那里窃窃私语。玛莎喜欢说话，这个生活在印度的奇怪的孩子，一直被“黑人”伺候着，这个新奇的事物足以吸引她。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
She sat down on the hearth herself without waiting to be asked.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">她自己坐在壁炉边，没有等人问。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“Art tha’ thinkin’ about that garden yet?” she said.
“I knew tha’ would. That was just the way with me when I first
heard about it.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“你还在想那个花园吗?”她说。我就知道你会的。当我第一次听说这件事的时候，我也是这么想的。”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“Why did he hate it?” Mary persisted.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“他为什么讨厌它?”玛丽坚持问。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
Martha tucked her feet under her and made herself quite comfortable.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">玛莎把脚放在身下，让自己很舒服。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“Listen to th’ wind wutherin’ round the house,” she
said. “You could bare stand up on the moor if you was out on it
tonight.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“听听房子周围呼啸的风声,”她说。“如果你今晚出去的话，你可以光着身子站在沼地上”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
Mary did not know what “wutherin’” meant until she listened,
and then she understood. It must mean that hollow shuddering sort of roar which
rushed round and round the house as if the giant no one could see were
buffeting it and beating at the walls and windows to try to break in. But one
knew he could not get in, and somehow it made one feel very safe and warm
inside a room with a red coal fire.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">玛丽不知道“呼啸”是什么意思，直到她听了，她才明白。这一定意味着那种空洞的颤抖的咆哮声在房子周围一圈又一圈地冲击着，就好像没有人能看见的巨人正在撞击着房子，敲打着墙壁和窗户试图闯进来。但是人们知道他进不去，不知怎么的，在一个有着红色煤火的房间里让人感到非常安全和温暖。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“But why did he hate it so?” she asked, after she had listened. She
intended to know if Martha did.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“可是他为什么这么讨厌呢?”她听完后问道。她想知道玛莎是不是讨厌。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
Then Martha gave up her store of knowledge.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">然后玛莎放弃了她的知识储备。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“Mind,” she said, “Mrs. Medlock said it’s not to be
talked about. There’s lots o’ things in this place that’s not
to be talked over. That’s Mr. Craven’s orders. His troubles are
none servants’ business, he says. But for th’ garden he
wouldn’t be like he is. It was Mrs. Craven’s garden that she had
made when first they were married an’ she just loved it, an’ they
used to ’tend the flowers themselves. An’ none o’ th’
gardeners was ever let to go in. Him an’ her used to go in an’ shut

talkin’. An’ she was just a bit of a girl an’ there was an
old tree with a branch bent like a seat on it. An’ she made roses grow
over it an’ she used to sit there. But one day when she was sittin’
there th’ branch broke an’ she fell on th’ ground an’
was hurt so bad that next day she died. Th’ doctors thought he’d go
out o’ his mind an’ die, too. That’s why he hates it. No
one’s never gone in since, an’ he won’t let anyone talk
about it.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“注意,”她说，“梅德洛克太太说这件事不能谈。这个地方有很多事情是不能讨论的。这是克雷文先生的命令。他说，他的麻烦与仆人无关。要不是为了花园，他不会变成现在这样。这是克雷文太太刚结婚时所做的花园，她很喜欢，他们过去常常自己照料花草。没有一个园丁被允许进去。他和她过去常常关上门，在那里呆上几个小时，读书，聊天。她只是一个小女孩，有一棵老树，树枝弯曲得像一个座位。她让玫瑰在上面生长，她过去常常坐在那里。但有一天她坐在那里，树枝折断了，她摔倒在地上，伤得很重，第二天就死了。医生也以为他会疯掉，然后死掉。所以他才不喜欢。从那以后再也没有人进去过，他也不让任何人谈论这件事。”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
Mary did not ask any more questions. She looked at the red fire and listened to
the wind “wutherin’.” It seemed to be
“wutherin’” louder than ever.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">玛丽没有再问任何问题。她看着红色的火焰，听着风“呼啸”的声音呼啸声似乎比以往任何时候都响亮。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
At that moment a very good thing was happening to her. Four good things had
happened to her, in fact, since she came to Misselthwaite Manor. She had felt
as if she had understood a robin and that he had understood her; she had run in
the wind until her blood had grown warm; she had been healthily hungry for the
first time in her life; and she had found out what it was to be sorry for
someone.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">在那一刻，一件非常好的事情发生在她身上。事实上，自从她来到 Misselthwaite Manor 以后，有四件好事发生在她身上。她感觉自己好像理解了一只知更鸟，而它也理解了她; 她在风中奔跑，直到她的血液变得温暖; 她这辈子第一次感到健康的饥饿; 她发现了为别人感到遗憾是什么感觉。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
But as she was listening to the wind she began to listen to something else. She
did not know what it was, because at first she could scarcely distinguish it
from the wind itself. It was a curious sound—it seemed almost as if a
child were crying somewhere. Sometimes the wind sounded rather like a child
crying, but presently Mistress Mary felt quite sure this sound was inside the
house, not outside it. It was far away, but it was inside. She turned round and
looked at Martha.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">但是当她听着风声的时候，她开始听到别的声音。她不知道那是什么，因为起初她几乎无法从风中辨别出来。那是一种奇怪的声音ーー听起来好像某个地方有个孩子在哭。有时候风声听起来像孩子的哭声，但是现在玛丽太太很确定这声音是在屋子里面，而不是屋外。虽然很远，但是在里面。她转过身来看着玛莎。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“Do you hear anyone crying?” she said.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“你听到有人在哭吗?”她说。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
Martha suddenly looked confused.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">玛莎突然看起来很困惑。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“No,” she answered. “It’s th’ wind. Sometimes it
sounds like as if someone was lost on th’ moor an’ wailin’.
It’s got all sorts o’ sounds.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“不,”她回答。是风。有时候听起来好像有人在荒原上迷路了。它有各种各样的声音。”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“But listen,” said Mary. “It’s in the house—down
one of those long corridors.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“可是听着,”玛丽说，“它就在房子里ーー沿着那些长长的走廊走下去。”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
And at that very moment a door must have been opened somewhere downstairs; for
a great rushing draft blew along the passage and the door of the room they sat
in was blown open with a crash, and as they both jumped to their feet the light
was blown out and the crying sound was swept down the far corridor so that it
was to be heard more plainly than ever.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">就在这个时候，楼下的某个地方一定有一扇门被打开了，因为一阵急促的风吹过通道，他们所在的房间的门砰的一声被吹开了，当他们跳起来的时候，灯被吹灭了，哭声被吹到了远处的走廊上，所以听起来比以往任何时候都清楚。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“There!” said Mary. “I told you so! It is someone
crying—and it isn’t a grown-up person.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“那儿!”玛丽说，“我告诉过你了! 那是有人在哭——而且不是一个成年人。”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
Martha ran and shut the door and turned the key, but before she did it they
both heard the sound of a door in some far passage shutting with a bang, and
then everything was quiet, for even the wind ceased
“wutherin’” for a few moments.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">玛莎跑过去，关上门，转动钥匙，但是在她转动钥匙之前，他们都听到远处通道里的一扇门砰的一声关上了，然后一切都安静了下来，因为甚至连风也停止了“呼啸”一会儿。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“It was th’ wind,” said Martha stubbornly. “An’
if it wasn’t, it was little Betty Butterworth, th’ scullery-maid.
She’s had th’ toothache all day.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“是风,”玛莎固执地说。如果不是的话，那就是小贝蒂 · 巴特沃斯，那个洗碗女工。她牙疼了一整天</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
But something troubled and awkward in her manner made Mistress Mary stare very
hard at her. She did not believe she was speaking the truth.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">但是玛丽太太的举止中有些令人不安和尴尬的地方，这使得她非常严厉地盯着她。她不相信她说的是实话。</p>

“THERE WAS SOMEONE CRYING—THERE WAS!”<font class="cyxy-trs-target"> “有人在哭，真的有!”</font></h2>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
The next day the rain poured down in torrents again, and when Mary looked out
of her window the moor was almost hidden by gray mist and cloud. There could be
no going out today.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">第二天，大雨又倾盆而下，当玛丽从窗口望出去的时候，沼地几乎被灰色的雾和云遮住了。今天不能出去。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“What do you do in your cottage when it rains like this?” she asked
Martha.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“这样下雨的时候，你在你的小屋里做什么?”她问玛莎。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“Try to keep from under each other’s feet mostly,” Martha
answered. “Eh! there does seem a lot of us then. Mother’s a
good-tempered woman but she gets fair moithered. The biggest ones goes out in
th’ cow-shed and plays there. Dickon he doesn’t mind th’ wet.
He goes out just th’ same as if th’ sun was shinin’. He says
he sees things on rainy days as doesn’t show when it’s fair
weather. He once found a little fox cub half drowned in its hole and he brought
it home in th’ bosom of his shirt to keep it warm. Its mother had been
killed nearby an’ th’ hole was swum out an’ th’ rest
o’ th’ litter was dead. He’s got it at home now. He found a
half-drowned young crow another time an’ he brought it home, too,
an’ tamed it. It’s named Soot because it’s so black,
an’ it hops an’ flies about with him everywhere.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“大多数时候，尽量不要互相踩在对方的脚下,”玛莎回答。“呃！看来我们人还真不少。妈妈是一个脾气好的女人，但她受到了公平的责备。最大的在牛棚里玩。迪肯，他不介意湿的。他出去的时候就像太阳在照耀一样。他说他在下雨天看到的东西在晴天看不到。有一次，他发现一只小狐狸在洞里快淹死了，于是他用衬衫的胸部把它带回家取暖。它的妈妈在附近被杀了，洞被游出来了，剩下的垃圾都死了。他现在在家里。有一次，他发现了一只淹得半死的小乌鸦，他把它也带回了家，并驯服了它。它的名字叫“烟灰”，因为它太黑了，到处都跟着它跳来跳去</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
The time had come when Mary had forgotten to resent Martha’s familiar
talk. She had even begun to find it interesting and to be sorry when she
stopped or went away. The stories she had been told by her Ayah when she lived
in India had been quite unlike those Martha had to tell about the moorland
cottage which held fourteen people who lived in four little rooms and never had
quite enough to eat. The children seemed to tumble about and amuse themselves
like a litter of rough, good-natured collie puppies. Mary was most attracted by
the mother and Dickon. When Martha told stories of what “mother”
said or did they always sounded comfortable.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">玛丽忘记了对玛莎熟悉的谈话感到不满的时候到了。她甚至开始觉得这件事很有趣，当她停下来或离开的时候，她感到很抱歉。当她住在印度的时候，她的阿雅给她讲的故事和玛莎讲的那些关于荒原小屋的故事完全不同，那里住着14个人，他们住在四个小房间里，从来没有足够的食物吃。孩子们似乎像一窝粗野、善良的牧羊犬小狗一样，到处打滚，自娱自乐。玛丽最为母亲和迪肯所吸引。当玛莎讲述“母亲”所说或所做的故事时，听起来总是很舒服。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“If I had a raven or a fox cub I could play with it,” said Mary.
“But I have nothing.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“如果我有一只乌鸦或者一只狐狸幼崽，我可以和它玩,”玛丽说，“但是我什么也没有。”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
Martha looked perplexed.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">玛莎看起来很困惑。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“Can tha’ knit?” she asked.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“你会织毛衣吗?”她问。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“No,” answered Mary.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“不,”玛丽回答。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“Can tha’ sew?”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“你会缝纫吗?”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“No.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“不”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“Can tha’ read?”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“你识字吗?”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“Yes.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“是的。”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“Then why doesn’t tha read somethin’, or learn a bit o’
spellin’? Tha’st old enough to be learnin’ thy book a good
bit now.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“那你为什么不读点东西，或者学点拼写呢？你已经长大了，现在可以好好学习你的书了。”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“I haven’t any books,” said Mary. “Those I had were
left in India.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“我没有任何书,”玛丽说，“我的那些书都留在印度了。”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“That’s a pity,” said Martha. “If Mrs. Medlock’d
let thee go into th’ library, there’s thousands o’ books
there.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“真可惜,”玛莎说，“如果梅德洛克太太让你去那个图书馆，那里有成千上万本书。”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
Mary did not ask where the library was, because she was suddenly inspired by a
new idea. She made up her mind to go and find it herself. She was not troubled
about Mrs. Medlock. Mrs. Medlock seemed always to be in her comfortable
housekeeper’s sitting-room downstairs. In this queer place one scarcely
ever saw anyone at all. In fact, there was no one to see but the servants, and
when their master was away they lived a luxurious life below stairs, where
there was a huge kitchen hung about with shining brass and pewter, and a large
servants’ hall where there were four or five abundant meals eaten every
day, and where a great deal of lively romping went on when Mrs. Medlock was out
of the way.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">玛丽没有问图书馆在哪里，因为她突然有了一个新的想法。她决定自己去找。她不担心梅德洛克夫人。梅德洛克夫人似乎总是呆在楼下她舒适的女管家起居室里。在这个奇怪的地方，人们几乎看不到任何人。事实上，除了仆人，没有人可以看到他们，当他们的主人不在的时候，他们在楼下过着奢侈的生活，那里有一个巨大的厨房，里面挂着闪闪发光的黄铜和白蜡，还有一个大的仆人大厅，每天有四五顿丰盛的饭菜可以吃，当梅德洛克夫人不在的时候，那里还有很多欢快的嬉闹。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
Mary’s meals were served regularly, and Martha waited on her, but no one
troubled themselves about her in the least. Mrs. Medlock came and looked at her
every day or two, but no one inquired what she did or told her what to do. She
supposed that perhaps this was the English way of treating children. In India
she had always been attended by her Ayah, who had followed her about and waited
on her, hand and foot. She had often been tired of her company. Now she was
followed by nobody and was learning to dress herself because Martha looked as
though she thought she was silly and stupid when she wanted to have things
handed to her and put on.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">玛丽的饭菜定期供应，玛莎伺候她，但是没有人为她操心。梅德洛克太太每隔一两天就来看她一眼，但没有人问她做了什么，也没有人告诉她该做什么。她想这也许是英国人对待孩子的方式。在印度，她的阿雅总是陪伴着她，她的阿雅跟在她身边，手脚并用地伺候着她。她常常厌倦了她的陪伴。现在没有人跟着她，她正在学着自己穿衣服，因为当玛莎想要别人把东西交给她穿时，她看起来好像觉得自己又傻又笨。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“Hasn’t tha’ got good sense?” she said once, when Mary
had stood waiting for her to put on her gloves for her. “Our Susan Ann is
twice as sharp as thee an’ she’s only four year’ old.
Sometimes tha’ looks fair soft in th’ head.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“难道你没有良好的判断力吗?”她说过一次，当时玛丽正站在那里等她为她戴上手套。“我们的苏珊安比你聪明两倍，而且她只有四岁。有时候你的脑袋看起来很软</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
Mary had worn her contrary scowl for an hour after that, but it made her think
several entirely new things.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">在那之后的一个小时里，玛丽一直愁眉苦脸，但这使她想到了几件全新的事情。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
She stood at the window for about ten minutes this morning after Martha had
swept up the hearth for the last time and gone downstairs. She was thinking
over the new idea which had come to her when she heard of the library. She did
not care very much about the library itself, because she had read very few
books; but to hear of it brought back to her mind the hundred rooms with closed
doors. She wondered if they were all really locked and what she would find if
she could get into any of them. Were there a hundred really? Why
shouldn’t she go and see how many doors she could count? It would be
something to do on this morning when she could not go out. She had never been
taught to ask permission to do things, and she knew nothing at all about
authority, so she would not have thought it necessary to ask Mrs. Medlock if
she might walk about the house, even if she had seen her.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">今天早上，在玛莎最后一次清扫壁炉下楼之后，她在窗前站了大约十分钟。当她听说图书馆的事情时，她正在思考一个新的想法。她对图书馆本身并不十分在意，因为她读的书很少; 但是听到这个消息，她又想起了那几百个关着门的房间。她想知道它们是否真的都是锁着的，如果她能进入其中的任何一个，她会发现什么。真的有一百个吗？她为什么不去看看她能数出多少扇门呢？如果她今天早上不能出去的话，那就有事可做了。从来没有人教过她做事情要征求别人的同意，她对权威一无所知，所以她不会认为有必要问梅德洛克太太她是否可以在房子里走走，即使她见过她。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
She opened the door of the room and went into the corridor, and then she began
her wanderings. It was a long corridor and it branched into other corridors and
it led her up short flights of steps which mounted to others again. There were
doors and doors, and there were pictures on the walls. Sometimes they were
pictures of dark, curious landscapes, but oftenest they were portraits of men
and women in queer, grand costumes made of satin and velvet. She found herself
in one long gallery whose walls were covered with these portraits. She had
never thought there could be so many in any house. She walked slowly down this
place and stared at the faces which also seemed to stare at her. She felt as if
they were wondering what a little girl from India was doing in their house.
Some were pictures of children—little girls in thick satin frocks which
reached to their feet and stood out about them, and boys with puffed sleeves
and lace collars and long hair, or with big ruffs around their necks. She
always stopped to look at the children, and wonder what their names were, and
where they had gone, and why they wore such odd clothes. There was a stiff,
plain little girl rather like herself. She wore a green brocade dress and held
a green parrot on her finger. Her eyes had a sharp, curious look.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">她打开房门，走进走廊，然后开始漫步。这是一条长长的走廊，它分支到其他的走廊，它引导她上了一段又一段的台阶。那里有门和门，墙上有图画。有时候它们是黑暗奇异风景的照片，但最常见的是男人和女人的肖像，他们穿着由缎子和天鹅绒制成的奇异的盛大服装。她发现自己在一个长长的画廊里，墙上挂满了这些肖像画。她从来没有想过在任何一个房子里会有这么多。她慢慢地走下这个地方，盯着那些似乎也在盯着她看的脸。她觉得他们好像在想，一个来自印度的小女孩在他们家里做什么。有些是孩子的照片——小女孩穿着厚厚的缎子连衣裙，长到脚边，显得很突出; 男孩子穿着蓬松的袖子，蕾丝领子，留着长发，或者脖子上戴着大领子。她总是停下来看看孩子们，想知道他们叫什么名字，去了哪里，为什么穿着这么奇怪的衣服。有一个很像她自己的僵硬、平凡的小女孩。她穿着一件绿色的锦衣，手指上戴着一只绿色的鹦鹉。她的眼睛有一种锐利的、好奇的神情。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“Where do you live now?” said Mary aloud to her. “I wish you
were here.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“你现在住在哪里?”玛丽大声问她。“我希望你在这里。”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
Surely no other little girl ever spent such a queer morning. It seemed as if
there was no one in all the huge rambling house but her own small self,
wandering about upstairs and down, through narrow passages and wide ones, where
it seemed to her that no one but herself had ever walked. Since so many rooms
had been built, people must have lived in them, but it all seemed so empty that
she could not quite believe it true.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">肯定没有哪个小女孩会度过这样一个奇怪的早晨。似乎除了她自己小小的一个人以外，整个大房子里没有一个人，她在楼上楼下徘徊，穿过狭窄的走廊和宽阔的走廊，在她看来，除了她自己以外，从来没有人走过这些地方。既然盖了这么多房子，人们一定住在里面，但是房子看起来那么空，她不太相信这是真的。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
It was not until she climbed to the second floor that she thought of turning
the handle of a door. All the doors were shut, as Mrs. Medlock had said they
were, but at last she put her hand on the handle of one of them and turned it.
She was almost frightened for a moment when she felt that it turned without
difficulty and that when she pushed upon the door itself it slowly and heavily
opened. It was a massive door and opened into a big bedroom. There were
embroidered hangings on the wall, and inlaid furniture such as she had seen in
India stood about the room. A broad window with leaded panes looked out upon
the moor; and over the mantel was another portrait of the stiff, plain little
girl who seemed to stare at her more curiously than ever.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">直到她爬到二楼，她才想到转动门把手。所有的门都像梅德洛克太太说的那样关上了，但最后她把手放在其中一扇门的把手上，转动了一下。她几乎吓了一跳，因为她觉得门转动起来毫无困难，当她推开门的时候，门慢慢地重重地打开了。那是一扇巨大的门，通向一间大卧室。墙上挂着刺绣，房间里摆放着她在印度见过的镶嵌家具。一扇宽大的窗户，镶着铅制的玻璃窗，向外望着荒野; 壁炉架上方是另一幅画，画的是一个僵硬、朴素的小女孩，她似乎比以往任何时候都更好奇地盯着她看。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“Perhaps she slept here once,” said Mary. “She stares at me
so that she makes me feel queer.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“也许她在这儿睡过一次,”玛丽说，“她盯着我看，让我觉得很奇怪。”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
After that she opened more doors and more. She saw so many rooms that she
became quite tired and began to think that there must be a hundred, though she
had not counted them. In all of them there were old pictures or old tapestries
with strange scenes worked on them. There were curious pieces of furniture and
curious ornaments in nearly all of them.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">从那以后，她打开了更多的门，甚至更多。她看到了那么多的房间，以至于她感到非常疲惫，她开始想一定有一百个房间，虽然她没有数过。在所有的作品中都有一些古老的图画或带有奇怪场景的旧挂毯。几乎所有的房间里都有奇怪的家具和奇怪的装饰品。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
In one room, which looked like a lady’s sitting-room, the hangings were
all embroidered velvet, and in a cabinet were about a hundred little elephants
made of ivory. They were of different sizes, and some had their mahouts or
palanquins on their backs. Some were much bigger than the others and some were
so tiny that they seemed only babies. Mary had seen carved ivory in India and
she knew all about elephants. She opened the door of the cabinet and stood on a
footstool and played with these for quite a long time. When she got tired she
set the elephants in order and shut the door of the cabinet.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">在一间看起来像是女士起居室的房间里，挂件都是绣花的天鹅绒，在一个橱柜里有大约一百只象牙制成的小象。它们大小不一，有的背上还有象夫或轿子。有些比其他的大得多，有些小得看起来只是婴儿。玛丽在印度见过象牙雕刻她对大象了如指掌。她打开橱柜的门，站在一个脚凳上，玩了好长时间。当她累了的时候，她整理好大象，关上橱柜的门。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
In all her wanderings through the long corridors and the empty rooms, she had
seen nothing alive; but in this room she saw something. Just after she had
closed the cabinet door she heard a tiny rustling sound. It made her jump and
look around at the sofa by the fireplace, from which it seemed to come. In the
corner of the sofa there was a cushion, and in the velvet which covered it
there was a hole, and out of the hole peeped a tiny head with a pair of
frightened eyes in it.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">她在长长的走廊和空荡荡的房间里走来走去，什么也没有看见，但是在这个房间里，她看见了一些东西。她刚关上橱柜的门，就听到一阵细微的沙沙声。这使她跳了起来，看了看壁炉旁的沙发，好像是从那里来的。在沙发的角落里有一个靠垫，在覆盖着它的天鹅绒里有一个洞，从洞里探出一个小小的头，里面有一双惊恐的眼睛。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
Mary crept softly across the room to look. The bright eyes belonged to a little
gray mouse, and the mouse had eaten a hole into the cushion and made a
comfortable nest there. Six baby mice were cuddled up asleep near her. If there
was no one else alive in the hundred rooms there were seven mice who did not
look lonely at all.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">玛丽蹑手蹑脚地穿过房间去看。那双明亮的眼睛属于一只灰色的小老鼠，老鼠在垫子上挖了一个洞，在那里筑了一个舒适的巢。六只小老鼠在她身边蜷缩着睡着了。如果这一百个房间里没有其他活着的人，那么就有七只老鼠，它们看起来一点也不孤单。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“If they wouldn’t be so frightened I would take them back with
me,” said Mary.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“如果他们不是那么害怕，我就把他们带回去了,”玛丽说。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
She had wandered about long enough to feel too tired to wander any farther, and
she turned back. Two or three times she lost her way by turning down the wrong
corridor and was obliged to ramble up and down until she found the right one;
but at last she reached her own floor again, though she was some distance from
her own room and did not know exactly where she was.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">她已经走了很长时间，感到太累了，不能再走远了，于是她转过身来。有两三次，她走错了走廊，迷了路，不得不在走廊上来回踱步，直到找到正确的那条; 但最后，她又回到了自己的楼层，尽管她离自己的房间有一段距离，不知道自己到底在哪里。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“I believe I have taken a wrong turning again,” she said, standing
still at what seemed the end of a short passage with tapestry on the wall.
“I don’t know which way to go. How still everything is!”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“我想我又走错路了,”她说，站在墙上挂着挂毯的一条短短的通道的尽头，一动不动。我不知道该走哪条路。一切都好安静啊!”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
It was while she was standing here and just after she had said this that the
stillness was broken by a sound. It was another cry, but not quite like the one
she had heard last night; it was only a short one, a fretful childish whine
muffled by passing through walls.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">就在她站在这里的时候，她刚说完这句话，一个声音打破了寂静。这是另一种叫声，但和她昨晚听到的不太一样; 这只是一种短促的叫声，是穿过墙壁时发出的一种烦躁的孩子气的呜咽声。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“It’s nearer than it was,” said Mary, her heart beating
rather faster. “And it <i>is</i> crying.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“它比以前更近了,”玛丽说，她的心跳得更快了。“而且它在哭。”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
She put her hand accidentally upon the tapestry near her, and then sprang back,
feeling quite startled. The tapestry was the covering of a door which fell open
and showed her that there was another part of the corridor behind it, and Mrs.
Medlock was coming up it with her bunch of keys in her hand and a very cross
look on her face.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">她不小心把手放在身边的挂毯上，然后跳了回来，感到非常吃惊。挂毯是一扇门的覆盖物，门开了，向她展示了走廊后面的另一部分，梅德洛克太太手里拿着一串钥匙走上来，脸上带着十分不悦的表情。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“What are you doing here?” she said, and she took Mary by the arm
and pulled her away. “What did I tell you?”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“你在这里做什么?”她说，然后抓住玛丽的胳膊把她拉开。“我怎么跟你说的?”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“I turned round the wrong corner,” explained Mary. “I
didn’t know which way to go and I heard someone crying.” She quite
hated Mrs. Medlock at the moment, but she hated her more the next.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“我拐错弯了,”玛丽解释说。“我不知道该走哪条路，我听到有人在哭”她现在很讨厌梅德洛克夫人，但是接下来她更讨厌她。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“You didn’t hear anything of the sort,” said the housekeeper.
“You come along back to your own nursery or I’ll box your
ears.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“你什么也没听到,”女管家说。“你给我滚回你自己的托儿所，不然我打爆你的耳朵”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
And she took her by the arm and half pushed, half pulled her up one passage and
down another until she pushed her in at the door of her own room.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">她拉着她的胳膊，一半推，一半拉着她上上下下，直到她把她推到自己房间的门口。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“Now,” she said, “you stay where you’re told to stay or
you’ll find yourself locked up. The master had better get you a
governess, same as he said he would. You’re one that needs someone to
look sharp after you. I’ve got enough to do.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“现在,”她说，“你呆在别人告诉你呆的地方，否则你会发现自己被关起来。主人最好给你找个家庭教师，就像他说的那样。你需要有人照顾你。我还有很多事要做。”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
She went out of the room and slammed the door after her, and Mary went and sat
on the hearth-rug, pale with rage. She did not cry, but ground her teeth.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">她走出房间，紧跟着砰地一声关上门，玛丽走过去，坐在壁炉边的地毯上，气得脸色苍白。她没有哭，而是咬紧牙关。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“There <i>was</i> someone crying—there <i>was</i>—there
<i>was!</i>” she said to herself.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“有人在哭，真的有人在哭!”她自言自语道。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
She had heard it twice now, and sometime she would find out. She had found out
a great deal this morning. She felt as if she had been on a long journey, and
at any rate she had had something to amuse her all the time, and she had played
with the ivory elephants and had seen the gray mouse and its babies in their
nest in the velvet cushion.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">她已经听过两遍了，有时她会发现的。她今天早上发现了很多事情。她觉得自己好像在长途旅行，总之，她总能找到一些东西让自己开心，她曾经和象牙象玩耍，曾经在天鹅绒垫子里看到过灰老鼠和它的孩子们在它们的窝里。</p>

THE KEY TO THE GARDEN<font class="cyxy-trs-target"> 花园的钥匙</font></h2>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
Two days after this, when Mary opened her eyes she sat upright in bed
immediately, and called to Martha.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">又过了两天，玛利亚睁开眼睛，立刻坐在床上，叫玛大来。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“Look at the moor! Look at the moor!”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“看那个沼泽! 看那个沼泽!”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
The rainstorm had ended and the gray mist and clouds had been swept away in the
night by the wind. The wind itself had ceased and a brilliant, deep blue sky
arched high over the moorland. Never, never had Mary dreamed of a sky so blue.
In India skies were hot and blazing; this was of a deep cool blue which almost
seemed to sparkle like the waters of some lovely bottomless lake, and here and
there, high, high in the arched blueness floated small clouds of snow-white
fleece. The far-reaching world of the moor itself looked softly blue instead of
gloomy purple-black or awful dreary gray.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">暴雨已经停了，夜里的灰雾和云被风吹散了。风停了，一片明亮的深蓝色的天空高高地拱起在荒原上。玛丽从来没有梦见过这么蓝的天空。印度的天空炎热而炽热，这是一种深冷的蓝色，几乎像一个可爱的深不见底的湖泊的水一样闪闪发光，这里那里，在高高的蓝色拱门中漂浮着一小团雪白的羊毛。旷野本身的辽阔世界看起来是柔和的蓝色，而不是阴郁的紫黑色或可怕的灰色。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“Aye,” said Martha with a cheerful grin. “Th’
storm’s over for a bit. It does like this at this time o’ th’
year. It goes off in a night like it was pretendin’ it had never been
here an’ never meant to come again. That’s because th’
springtime’s on its way. It’s a long way off yet, but it’s
comin’.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“是啊,”玛莎愉快地笑着说。“暴风雨已经过去一段时间了。每年的这个时候都是这样。它在一个夜晚爆炸，就像它假装它从来没有来过这里，从来没有打算再来一次。因为春天就要来了。虽然还有很长的路要走，但终究会到来的。”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“I thought perhaps it always rained or looked dark in England,”
Mary said.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“我想也许在英国总是下雨或者看起来很黑,”玛丽说。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“Eh! no!” said Martha, sitting up on her heels among her black lead
brushes. “Nowt o’ th’ soart!”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“啊! 不!”玛莎说着，在她的黑色铅笔中间坐了起来。“没什么大不了的!”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“What does that mean?” asked Mary seriously. In India the natives
spoke different dialects which only a few people understood, so she was not
surprised when Martha used words she did not know.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“这是什么意思?”玛丽认真地问。在印度，当地人讲不同的方言，只有少数人能听懂，所以当玛莎使用她不认识的单词时，她并不感到惊讶。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
Martha laughed as she had done the first morning.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">玛莎像第一天早晨那样笑了。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“There now,” she said. “I’ve talked broad Yorkshire
again like Mrs. Medlock said I mustn’t. ‘Nowt o’ th’
soart’ means ‘nothin’-of-the-sort,’” slowly and
carefully, “but it takes so long to say it. Yorkshire’s th’
sunniest place on earth when it is sunny. I told thee tha’d like
th’ moor after a bit. Just you wait till you see th’ gold-colored
gorse blossoms an’ th’ blossoms o’ th’ broom, an’
th’ heather flowerin’, all purple bells, an’ hundreds
o’ butterflies flutterin’ an’ bees hummin’ an’
skylarks soarin’ up an’ singin’. You’ll want to get out
on it at sunrise an’ live out on it all day like Dickon does.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“好了,”她说。“我已经像梅德洛克夫人说的那样，再次谈论了广阔的约克郡。“不是那个意思”意思是“没什么”慢慢地，小心翼翼地说“但是说出来要花很长时间”。约克郡是世界上阳光最充足的地方。我告诉过你，过一会儿你会喜欢这个沼地的。等着瞧吧，你会看到金色的金雀花，金雀花，石南花，紫色的铃铛，数以百计的蝴蝶在飞舞，蜜蜂在嗡嗡叫，云雀在飞翔，歌唱。你会想在日出的时候出去，像迪肯一样在外面生活一整天。”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“Could I ever get there?” asked Mary wistfully, looking through her
window at the far-off blue. It was so new and big and wonderful and such a
heavenly color.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“我能到达那里吗?”玛丽若有所思地问，透过窗户望着远处的蓝色。它是如此崭新，如此宏大，如此美妙，如此天堂般的色彩。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“I don’t know,” answered Martha. “Tha’s never
used tha’ legs since tha’ was born, it seems to me. Tha’
couldn’t walk five mile. It’s five mile to our cottage.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“我不知道,”玛莎回答。“在我看来，你从来没有用过你的腿”。你连五英里都走不了。离我们的小屋有五英里。”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“I should like to see your cottage.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“我想看看你的小屋”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
Martha stared at her a moment curiously before she took up her polishing brush
and began to rub the grate again. She was thinking that the small plain face
did not look quite as sour at this moment as it had done the first morning she
saw it. It looked just a trifle like little Susan Ann’s when she wanted
something very much.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">玛莎好奇地盯着她看了一会儿，然后拿起她的抛光刷又开始擦壁炉。她在想，那张平凡的小脸此刻看起来并不像第一天早上那样酸酸的。当小苏珊 · 安非常想要某样东西的时候，它看起来只是一个小玩意儿。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“I’ll ask my mother about it,” she said. “She’s
one o’ them that nearly always sees a way to do things. It’s my day
out today an’ I’m goin’ home. Eh! I am glad. Mrs. Medlock
thinks a lot o’ mother. Perhaps she could talk to her.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“我会问问我妈妈的,”她说。“她是那种几乎总能想到办法的人。今天是我外出的日子，我要回家了。呃！我很高兴。梅德洛克夫人对母亲的看法很多。也许她可以和她谈谈。”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“I like your mother,” said Mary.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“我喜欢你妈妈,”玛丽说。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“I should think tha’ did,” agreed Martha, polishing away.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“我认为你做到了,”玛莎同意道，一边擦拭着。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“I’ve never seen her,” said Mary.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“我从来没有见过她,”玛丽说。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“No, tha’ hasn’t,” replied Martha.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“不，你没有,”玛莎回答。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
She sat up on her heels again and rubbed the end of her nose with the back of
her hand as if puzzled for a moment, but she ended quite positively.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">她又坐了起来，用手背摩挲着鼻尖，好像有一会儿感到困惑，但结果还是相当不错的。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“Well, she’s that sensible an’ hard workin’ an’
good-natured an’ clean that no one could help likin’ her whether
they’d seen her or not. When I’m goin’ home to her on my day
out I just jump for joy when I’m crossin’ the moor.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“嗯，她很明智，工作努力，性格温和，干净整洁，不管见过没见过她，没人会不喜欢她。当我外出的时候回到她身边，当我穿过沼泽的时候，我会高兴得跳起来。”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“I like Dickon,” added Mary. “And I’ve never seen
him.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“我喜欢狄肯,”玛丽补充说，“我从来没有见过他。”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“Well,” said Martha stoutly, “I’ve told thee that
th’ very birds likes him an’ th’ rabbits an’ wild sheep
an’ ponies, an’ th’ foxes themselves. I wonder,”
staring at her reflectively, “what Dickon would think of thee?”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“好吧,”玛莎坚定地说，“我告诉过你，所有的鸟儿都喜欢他，兔子、野羊、小马，还有狐狸也喜欢他。“我想知道,”她若有所思地望着她，“狄肯会怎么看你呢?”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“He wouldn’t like me,” said Mary in her stiff, cold little
way. “No one does.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“他不会喜欢我的,”玛丽用她那僵硬、冰冷的小方式说，“没有人喜欢我。”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
Martha looked reflective again.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">玛莎又陷入了沉思。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“How does tha’ like thysel’?” she inquired, really
quite as if she were curious to know.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“你‘喜欢你自己’吗?”她问道，好像真的很好奇似的。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
Mary hesitated a moment and thought it over.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">玛丽犹豫了一会儿，仔细考虑了一下。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“Not at all—really,” she answered. “But I never thought
of that before.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“完全没有，真的,”她回答，“但我以前从来没有想过这个问题。”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
Martha grinned a little as if at some homely recollection.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">玛莎露齿一笑，好像在回忆什么平淡无奇的往事。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“Mother said that to me once,” she said. “She was at her
wash-tub an’ I was in a bad temper an’ talkin’ ill of folk,
an’ she turns round on me an’ says: ‘Tha’ young vixen,
tha’! There tha’ stands sayin’ tha’ doesn’t like
this one an’ tha’ doesn’t like that one. How does tha’
like thysel’?’ It made me laugh an’ it brought me to my
senses in a minute.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“妈妈对我说过一次,”她说。“她在洗澡，‘我脾气不好’，‘说别人坏话’，然后‘她转过身来对我说: ‘你这个年轻的泼妇，你这个’！你们站在那里说你们不喜欢这个，也不喜欢那个。你喜欢你自己吗？它让我发笑，让我在一分钟内恢复理智</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
She went away in high spirits as soon as she had given Mary her breakfast. She
was going to walk five miles across the moor to the cottage, and she was going
to help her mother with the washing and do the week’s baking and enjoy
herself thoroughly.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">她一给玛丽吃完早饭就兴高采烈地走了。她打算步行五英里穿过沼泽到达小屋，她打算帮她妈妈洗衣服，做一周的烘焙，好好享受。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
Mary felt lonelier than ever when she knew she was no longer in the house. She
went out into the garden as quickly as possible, and the first thing she did
was to run round and round the fountain flower garden ten times. She counted
the times carefully and when she had finished she felt in better spirits. The
sunshine made the whole place look different. The high, deep, blue sky arched
over Misselthwaite as well as over the moor, and she kept lifting her face and
looking up into it, trying to imagine what it would be like to lie down on one
of the little snow-white clouds and float about. She went into the first
kitchen-garden and found Ben Weatherstaff working there with two other
gardeners. The change in the weather seemed to have done him good. He spoke to
her of his own accord.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">当玛丽知道她不在家时，她感到前所未有的孤独。她以最快的速度跑到花园里，她做的第一件事就是绕着喷泉花园跑了十圈。她仔细地计算着时间，当她计算完时，她感到精神好多了。阳光让整个地方看起来都不一样了。高高的、深深的、蓝色的天空在米瑟斯韦特和荒原上空形成了一道弧形，她不停地抬起头，向上看着天空，试图想象躺在一朵雪白的小云上，四处飘荡是什么感觉。她走进第一个菜园，发现本 · 韦瑟斯塔夫和另外两个园丁在那里干活。天气的变化似乎对他有好处。他主动和她说话。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“Springtime’s comin,’” he said. “Cannot
tha’ smell it?”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“春天来了,”他说，“你闻不到吗?”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
Mary sniffed and thought she could.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">玛丽吸了吸鼻子，以为她可以。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“I smell something nice and fresh and damp,” she said.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“我闻到了一股新鲜潮湿的香味,”她说。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“That’s th’ good rich earth,” he answered, digging
away. “It’s in a good humor makin’ ready to grow things.
It’s glad when plantin’ time comes. It’s dull in th’
winter when it’s got nowt to do. In th’ flower gardens out there
things will be stirrin’ down below in th’ dark. Th’
sun’s warmin’ ’em. You’ll see bits o’ green
spikes stickin’ out o’ th’ black earth after a bit.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“那是一块肥沃的好土地,”他一边挖着一边回答。“这是一个很好的幽默，使’准备成长的东西。种植时间到了，真是太好了。冬天无事可做的时候很无聊。在外面的花园里，在黑暗中，一切都会在下面搅动。阳光温暖着他们。过一会儿，你会看到一些绿色的尖刺从黑色的土地上伸出来。”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“What will they be?” asked Mary.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“会是什么呢?”玛丽问。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“Crocuses an’ snowdrops an’ daffydowndillys. Has tha’
never seen them?”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“番红花，雪花莲和水仙花，你没见过吗?”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“No. Everything is hot, and wet, and green after the rains in
India,” said Mary. “And I think things grow up in a night.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“不。印度雨后，一切都是炎热、潮湿和绿色的。”玛丽说。“我认为事物是在一夜之间成长起来的”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“These won’t grow up in a night,” said Weatherstaff.
“Tha’ll have to wait for ’em. They’ll poke up a bit
higher here, an’ push out a spike more there, an’ uncurl a leaf
this day an’ another that. You watch ’em.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“它们不会在一夜之间长大,”韦瑟斯塔夫说。你得等他们。它们会在这里长高一点，在那里长出更多的穗，今天会长出一片叶子，明天会长出另一片叶子。你看着他们</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“I am going to,” answered Mary.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“我正要去,”玛丽回答。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
Very soon she heard the soft rustling flight of wings again and she knew at
once that the robin had come again. He was very pert and lively, and hopped
about so close to her feet, and put his head on one side and looked at her so
slyly that she asked Ben Weatherstaff a question.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">很快，她又听到了翅膀轻柔的沙沙声，她立刻知道知更鸟又来了。他非常机灵活泼，在她脚边蹦来蹦去，把头歪向一边，狡猾地看着她，以至于她问了本 · 韦瑟斯塔夫一个问题。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“Do you think he remembers me?” she said.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“你觉得他还记得我吗?”她说。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“Remembers thee!” said Weatherstaff indignantly. “He knows
every cabbage stump in th’ gardens, let alone th’ people.
He’s never seen a little wench here before, an’ he’s bent on
findin’ out all about thee. Tha’s no need to try to hide anything
from <i>him</i>.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“记住你!”韦瑟斯塔夫气愤地说。“他知道花园里的每一棵卷心菜，更不用说人们了。他以前从来没有在这里见过一个小姑娘，他一心想要了解你的一切。没必要对他隐瞒什么”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“Are things stirring down below in the dark in that garden where he
lives?” Mary inquired.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“在他住的那个花园里，黑暗中有什么东西在下面搅动吗?”玛丽问。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“What garden?” grunted Weatherstaff, becoming surly again.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“什么花园?”韦瑟斯塔夫咕哝着，又变得生气起来。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“The one where the old rose-trees are.” She could not help asking,
because she wanted so much to know. “Are all the flowers dead, or do some
of them come again in the summer? Are there ever any roses?”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“那里有古老的玫瑰树”她忍不住问，因为她太想知道了。“所有的花都枯萎了吗? 还是有些在夏天又开了？有玫瑰吗?”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“Ask him,” said Ben Weatherstaff, hunching his shoulders toward the
robin. “He’s the only one as knows. No one else has seen inside it
for ten year’.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“问他吧,”本 · 威瑟斯塔夫说着，向知更鸟耸起了肩膀。他是唯一一个知道。已经有十年没有人看过里面了。”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
Ten years was a long time, Mary thought. She had been born ten years ago.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">玛丽想，十年是很长的一段时间，她是十年前出生的。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
She walked away, slowly thinking. She had begun to like the garden just as she
had begun to like the robin and Dickon and Martha’s mother. She was
beginning to like Martha, too. That seemed a good many people to
like—when you were not used to liking. She thought of the robin as one of
the people. She went to her walk outside the long, ivy-covered wall over which
she could see the tree-tops; and the second time she walked up and down the
most interesting and exciting thing happened to her, and it was all through Ben
Weatherstaff’s robin.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">她走开了，慢慢地思考着。她开始喜欢花园，就像她开始喜欢知更鸟、狄肯和玛莎的母亲一样。她也开始喜欢玛莎了。当你不习惯喜欢的时候，似乎有很多人喜欢你。她认为知更鸟是人类中的一员。她走到长长的、爬满常春藤的墙外面，透过墙可以看到树梢; 第二次她上下走动时，最有趣、最令人兴奋的事情发生在她身上，这一切都贯穿了本 · 韦瑟斯塔夫的知更鸟。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
She heard a chirp and a twitter, and when she looked at the bare flower-bed at
her left side there he was hopping about and pretending to peck things out of
the earth to persuade her that he had not followed her. But she knew he had
followed her and the surprise so filled her with delight that she almost
trembled a little.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">她听到叽叽喳喳的声音，当她看到她左边光秃秃的花坛时，他正在跳来跳去，假装在啄地上的东西，劝她说他没有跟踪她。但是她知道他已经跟着她了，这个惊喜使她高兴得几乎有点发抖。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“You do remember me!” she cried out. “You do! You are
prettier than anything else in the world!”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“你记得我!”她喊道。“你记得! 你比世界上任何东西都漂亮!”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
She chirped, and talked, and coaxed and he hopped, and flirted his tail and
twittered. It was as if he were talking. His red waistcoat was like satin and
he puffed his tiny breast out and was so fine and so grand and so pretty that
it was really as if he were showing her how important and like a human person a
robin could be. Mistress Mary forgot that she had ever been contrary in her
life when he allowed her to draw closer and closer to him, and bend down and
talk and try to make something like robin sounds.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">她叽叽喳喳地叫着，说着，哄着，他跳着，摇着尾巴，叽叽喳喳地叫着。他好像在说话。他的红色马甲像缎子一样，他鼓起他的小胸脯，是如此的精致，如此的壮观，如此的漂亮，这真的好像他在向她展示一只知更鸟是多么的重要，多么的像一个人类。玛丽太太忘记了她一生中从来没有过这样的相反，当他允许她离他越来越近，弯下腰说话，试图发出像知更鸟一样的声音。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
Oh! to think that he should actually let her come as near to him as that! He
knew nothing in the world would make her put out her hand toward him or startle
him in the least tiniest way. He knew it because he was a real
person—only nicer than any other person in the world. She was so happy
that she scarcely dared to breathe.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">噢！他竟然让她那样靠近他！他知道这个世界上没有任何东西能使她向他伸出手，或者以最微小的方式使他受到惊吓。他知道这一点，因为他是一个真正的人ーー只是比世界上任何其他人都要好。她高兴得几乎不敢呼吸。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
The flower-bed was not quite bare. It was bare of flowers because the perennial
plants had been cut down for their winter rest, but there were tall shrubs and
low ones which grew together at the back of the bed, and as the robin hopped
about under them she saw him hop over a small pile of freshly turned up earth.
He stopped on it to look for a worm. The earth had been turned up because a dog
had been trying to dig up a mole and he had scratched quite a deep hole.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">花坛并不十分光秃秃的。这里没有花，因为多年生的植物已经被砍掉过冬，但是有高大的灌木和低矮的一起生长在床的后面，当知更鸟在它们下面跳来跳去的时候，她看到它跳过一小堆刚刚翻开的泥土。他停下来寻找虫子。土被挖开是因为一只狗想挖出一只鼹鼠，它挖了一个相当深的洞。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
Mary looked at it, not really knowing why the hole was there, and as she looked
she saw something almost buried in the newly-turned soil. It was something like
a ring of rusty iron or brass and when the robin flew up into a tree nearby she
put out her hand and picked the ring up. It was more than a ring, however; it
was an old key which looked as if it had been buried a long time.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">玛丽看着它，不知道为什么那里有个洞，当她看着它的时候，她看到一些东西几乎被埋在了刚翻开的土里。它像是一个生锈的铁或黄铜制成的戒指，当知更鸟飞上附近的一棵树时，她伸出手把戒指捡了起来。然而，这不仅仅是一枚戒指，而是一把旧钥匙，看起来好像被埋了很长时间。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
Mistress Mary stood up and looked at it with an almost frightened face as it
hung from her finger.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">玛丽太太站了起来，看着挂在她手指上的那个东西，脸上露出几乎害怕的表情。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“Perhaps it has been buried for ten years,” she said in a whisper.
“Perhaps it is the key to the garden!”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“也许它已经被埋了十年了,”她低声说。“也许这就是花园的钥匙!”</p>

THE ROBIN WHO SHOWED THE WAY<font class="cyxy-trs-target"> 带路的知更鸟</font></h2>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
She looked at the key quite a long time. She turned it over and over, and
thought about it. As I have said before, she was not a child who had been
trained to ask permission or consult her elders about things. All she thought
about the key was that if it was the key to the closed garden, and she could
find out where the door was, she could perhaps open it and see what was inside
the walls, and what had happened to the old rose-trees. It was because it had
been shut up so long that she wanted to see it. It seemed as if it must be
different from other places and that something strange must have happened to it
during ten years. Besides that, if she liked it she could go into it every day
and shut the door behind her, and she could make up some play of her own and
play it quite alone, because nobody would ever know where she was, but would
think the door was still locked and the key buried in the earth. The thought of
that pleased her very much.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">她盯着钥匙看了很长时间。她把它翻来覆去地看，然后想了想。正如我以前说过的，她不是一个受过训练的孩子，不会征求许可，也不会就事情向长辈咨询。她满脑子想的都是这把钥匙，如果这把钥匙就是那个封闭的花园的钥匙，她就能找到那扇门在哪里，也许她能打开它，看看墙里面有什么，还有那些老玫瑰树发生了什么。那是因为它被关了太久，所以她想去看看。它看起来一定和其他地方不一样，而且十年间一定发生了什么奇怪的事情。除此之外，如果她喜欢它，她可以每天走进去，关上身后的门，她可以编造一些自己的游戏，独自玩它，因为没有人会知道她在哪里，但会认为门仍然锁着，钥匙埋在地下。这个想法使她非常高兴。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
Living as it were, all by herself in a house with a hundred mysteriously closed
rooms and having nothing whatever to do to amuse herself, had set her inactive
brain to working and was actually awakening her imagination. There is no doubt
that the fresh, strong, pure air from the moor had a great deal to do with it.
Just as it had given her an appetite, and fighting with the wind had stirred
her blood, so the same things had stirred her mind. In India she had always
been too hot and languid and weak to care much about anything, but in this
place she was beginning to care and to want to do new things. Already she felt
less “contrary,” though she did not know why.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">她一个人住在一所房子里，房子里有一百间神秘地紧闭着的房间，没有任何事情可以让她自己娱乐，这使她不活跃的大脑开始工作，实际上正在唤醒她的想象力。毫无疑问，来自沼地的新鲜、强劲、纯净的空气与此有很大关系。正如它给了她食欲，与风搏斗激起了她的热血，同样的事情也激起了她的思想。在印度，她总是太热，太疲惫，太虚弱，以至于什么都不在乎，但是在这个地方，她开始在乎，想要做新的事情。尽管不知道为什么，她已经感觉不那么“相反”了。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
She put the key in her pocket and walked up and down her walk. No one but
herself ever seemed to come there, so she could walk slowly and look at the
wall, or, rather, at the ivy growing on it. The ivy was the baffling thing.
Howsoever carefully she looked she could see nothing but thickly growing,
glossy, dark green leaves. She was very much disappointed. Something of her
contrariness came back to her as she paced the walk and looked over it at the
tree-tops inside. It seemed so silly, she said to herself, to be near it and
not be able to get in. She took the key in her pocket when she went back to the
house, and she made up her mind that she would always carry it with her when
she went out, so that if she ever should find the hidden door she would be
ready.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">她把钥匙放在口袋里，在路上走来走去。似乎除了她自己，没有人来过这里，所以她可以慢慢地走着，看着墙壁，或者，更确切地说，看着墙上长着的常春藤。常春藤是令人困惑的东西。无论她怎么仔细看，她什么也看不见，只能看见茂密的、有光泽的、深绿色的叶子。她非常失望。当她踱着步子，看着里面的树梢时，她的一些矛盾又回来了。她对自己说，靠近它却不能进去，真是太傻了。当她回到家的时候，她把钥匙放在口袋里，并且她下定决心，当她出去的时候，她会一直带着它，这样如果她找到了那扇暗门，她就会做好准备。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
Mrs. Medlock had allowed Martha to sleep all night at the cottage, but she was
back at her work in the morning with cheeks redder than ever and in the best of

She was full of stories of the delights of her day out. Her mother had been
glad to see her and they had got the baking and washing all out of the way. She
had even made each of the children a doughcake with a bit of brown sugar in it.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">她满口都是她外出时的快乐故事。她母亲见到她很高兴，他们已经把烘焙和清洗的事情都做完了。她甚至给每个孩子都做了一个甜面包，里面加了一点红糖。</p>

“I had ’em all pipin’ hot when they came in from

In the evening they had all sat round the fire, and Martha and her mother had
sewed patches on torn clothes and mended stockings and Martha had told them
about the little girl who had come from India and who had been waited on all
her life by what Martha called “blacks” until she didn’t know
how to put on her own stockings.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">晚上，他们都围坐在炉火旁，玛莎和她的母亲缝补破衣服和补袜子，玛莎告诉他们一个来自印度的小女孩，她一生都被玛莎所说的“黑人”伺候着，直到她不知道怎么穿上自己的袜子。</p>

“Eh! they did like to hear about you,” said Martha. “They
wanted to know all about th’ blacks an’ about th’ ship you
came in. I couldn’t tell ’em enough.”

Mary reflected a little.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">玛丽沉思了一会儿。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“I’ll tell you a great deal more before your next day out,”
she said, “so that you will have more to talk about. I dare say they
would like to hear about riding on elephants and camels, and about the officers
going to hunt tigers.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“在你第二天出去之前，我会告诉你更多的事情,”她说，“这样你就有更多的话要说了。”。我敢说，他们想听到骑在大象和骆驼上的故事，以及军官们打猎老虎的故事。”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“My word!” cried delighted Martha. “It would set ’em
clean off their heads. Would tha’ really do that, Miss? It would be same
as a wild beast show like we heard they had in York once.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“我的话!”玛莎高兴地喊道。“这会让他们头脑发热。真的吗，小姐？就像我们在约克听到的野兽表演一样</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“India is quite different from Yorkshire,” Mary said slowly, as she
thought the matter over. “I never thought of that. Did Dickon and your
mother like to hear you talk about me?”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“印度和约克郡很不一样,”玛丽想了想，慢慢地说。“我从来没有想过这一点。迪肯和你妈妈喜欢听你谈论我吗?”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“Why, our Dickon’s eyes nearly started out o’ his head, they
got that round,” answered Martha. “But mother, she was put out
about your seemin’ to be all by yourself like. She said,
‘Hasn’t Mr. Craven got no governess for her, nor no nurse?’
and I said, ‘No, he hasn’t, though Mrs. Medlock says he will when
he thinks of it, but she says he mayn’t think of it for two or three
years.’”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“哎呀，我们的狄肯的眼睛都快瞪出脑袋来了，他们的眼睛都瞪圆了,”玛莎回答说。”但是妈妈，她很不高兴，因为你看起来像是一个人。她说: “克雷文先生没有家庭教师，也没有护士吗?”？我说，不，他还没有，尽管梅德洛克太太说他会考虑的，但她说他可能两三年都不会考虑这个问题。”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“I don’t want a governess,” said Mary sharply.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“我不需要家庭教师,”玛丽严厉地说。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“But mother says you ought to be learnin’ your book by this time

‘Now, Martha, you just think how you’d feel yourself, in a big

your best to cheer her up,’ she says, an’ I said I would.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“但是妈妈说你应该在这个时候学习你的书，你应该有一个女人来照顾你,”她说: “现在，玛莎，你只要想想你自己的感受，在那样一个大的地方，一个人独自徘徊，没有妈妈。“你尽力让她高兴起来,”她说，“我说过我会的。”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
Mary gave her a long, steady look.

Presently Martha went out of the room and came back with something held in her
hands under her apron.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">不一会儿，玛莎走出房间，回来时，围裙下面手里拿着什么东西。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“What does tha’ think,” she said, with a cheerful grin.
“I’ve brought thee a present.”

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“A present!” exclaimed Mistress Mary. How could a cottage full of
fourteen hungry people give anyone a present!
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“礼物!”玛丽太太叫道。一间小屋里住满了十四个饥肠辘辘的人，怎么可能给别人礼物呢！</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“A man was drivin’ across the moor peddlin’,” Martha
explained. “An’ he stopped his cart at our door. He had pots
an’ pans an’ odds an’ ends, but mother had no money to buy
anythin’. Just as he was goin’ away our ’Lizabeth Ellen
called out, ‘Mother, he’s got skippin’-ropes with red
an’ blue handles.’ An’ mother she calls out quite sudden,
‘Here, stop, mister! How much are they?’ An’ he says
‘Tuppence’, an’ mother she began fumblin’ in her pocket
an’ she says to me, ‘Martha, tha’s brought me thy wages like
a good lass, an’ I’ve got four places to put every penny, but
I’m just goin’ to take tuppence out of it to buy that child a
skippin’-rope,’ an’ she bought one an’ here it
is.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“一个男人开车在沼地上兜售,”玛莎解释说。”他把车停在我们门口。他有一些锅碗瓢盆和零碎的东西，但是妈妈没有钱买任何东西。就在他要离开的时候，我们的伊丽莎白 · 艾伦喊道: “妈妈，他有一个红蓝相间的绳子。”。“妈妈突然叫道,”这里，停下来，先生！多少钱？他说‘两便士’，妈妈开始在口袋里摸索，她对我说，‘玛莎，你像个好姑娘一样给我带来了你的工资，‘我有四个地方可以放每一分钱，但是我要从中拿出两便士给那个孩子买一条跳绳,’她买了一条，然后就在这儿了。’”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
She brought it out from under her apron and exhibited it quite proudly. It was
a strong, slender rope with a striped red and blue handle at each end, but Mary
Lennox had never seen a skipping-rope before. She gazed at it with a mystified
expression.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">她把它从围裙下拿了出来，非常自豪地展示出来。这是一条结实、细长的绳子，两端各有一个红蓝相间的条纹把手，但玛丽 · 伦诺克斯以前从未见过跳绳。她用一种迷惑的表情凝视着它。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“What is it for?” she asked curiously.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“这是干什么用的?”她好奇地问。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“For!” cried out Martha. “Does tha’ mean that
they’ve not got skippin’-ropes in India, for all they’ve got
elephants and tigers and camels! No wonder most of ’em’s black.
This is what it’s for; just watch me.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“为了!”玛莎喊道。“这是否意味着他们在印度没有跳绳，因为他们有大象、老虎和骆驼！怪不得大部分都是黑人。这就是它的作用，看着我。”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
And she ran into the middle of the room and, taking a handle in each hand,
began to skip, and skip, and skip, while Mary turned in her chair to stare at
her, and the queer faces in the old portraits seemed to stare at her, too, and
wonder what on earth this common little cottager had the impudence to be doing
under their very noses. But Martha did not even see them. The interest and
curiosity in Mistress Mary’s face delighted her, and she went on skipping
and counted as she skipped until she had reached a hundred.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">她跑到房间中间，两只手各拿一个把手，开始蹦蹦跳跳，玛丽转过椅子看着她，那些古怪的面孔似乎也在盯着她，想知道这个普通的小村民到底在他们眼皮底下做了什么。但玛莎甚至没有看到他们。玛丽太太脸上的兴趣和好奇心使她高兴起来，她继续蹦蹦跳跳地数着，直到数到一百。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“I could skip longer than that,” she said when she stopped.
“I’ve skipped as much as five hundred when I was twelve, but I
wasn’t as fat then as I am now, an’ I was in practice.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“我可以跳过更长的时间,”她说，当她停止。“我十二岁的时候跳过多达五百次，但那时我没有现在这么胖，而且我还在练习。”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“You just try it,” urged Martha, handing her the skipping-rope.
“You can’t skip a hundred at first, but if you practice
you’ll mount up. That’s what mother said. She says,
‘Nothin’ will do her more good than skippin’ rope. It’s
th’ sensiblest toy a child can have. Let her play out in th’ fresh
air skippin’ an’ it’ll stretch her legs an’ arms
an’ give her some strength in ’em.’”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“你就试试吧,”玛莎催促着，把跳绳递给她。“一开始你不可能跳过一百次，但是如果你练习，你会越来越多。妈妈也是这么说的。她说，没有什么比跳绳对她更好了。这是一个孩子能拥有的最明智的玩具。让她在新鲜空气中玩耍跳跃会让她伸展双腿和手臂，给她一些力量。”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
It was plain that there was not a great deal of strength in Mistress
Mary’s arms and legs when she first began to skip. She was not very
clever at it, but she liked it so much that she did not want to stop.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">很明显，当玛丽小姐第一次开始蹦蹦跳跳的时候，她的胳膊和腿并没有多大的力气。她在这方面不是很聪明，但是她非常喜欢，不想停下来。</p>

“Put on tha’ things and run an’ skip out o’
doors,” said Martha. “Mother said I must tell you to keep out

wrap up warm.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“穿上你的东西，然后跑出门去,”玛莎说。“妈妈说，我必须告诉你尽可能地不要出门，即使下雨，这样你才能暖和起来。”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
Mary put on her coat and hat and took her skipping-rope over her arm. She
opened the door to go out, and then suddenly thought of something and turned
back rather slowly.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">玛丽穿上外套，戴上帽子，把跳绳套在胳膊上。她打开门准备出去，突然想到了什么，慢慢地转过身去。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“Martha,” she said, “they were your wages. It was your
two-pence really. Thank you.” She said it stiffly because she was not
used to thanking people or noticing that they did things for her. “Thank

to do.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“玛莎,”她说，“那是你的工资。其实是你的两便士。谢谢她生硬地说，因为她不习惯感谢别人或注意到他们为她做的事情。“谢谢你,”她说，伸出手，因为她不知道还能做什么。</p>

Martha gave her hand a clumsy little shake, as if she was not accustomed to
this sort of thing either. Then she laughed.

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
Mistress Mary felt a little awkward as she went out of the room. Yorkshire
people seemed strange, and Martha was always rather a puzzle to her. At first
she had disliked her very much, but now she did not. The skipping-rope was a
wonderful thing. She counted and skipped, and skipped and counted, until her
cheeks were quite red, and she was more interested than she had ever been since
she was born. The sun was shining and a little wind was blowing—not a
rough wind, but one which came in delightful little gusts and brought a fresh
scent of newly turned earth with it. She skipped round the fountain garden, and
up one walk and down another. She skipped at last into the kitchen-garden and
saw Ben Weatherstaff digging and talking to his robin, which was hopping about
him. She skipped down the walk toward him and he lifted his head and looked at
her with a curious expression. She had wondered if he would notice her. She
wanted him to see her skip.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">玛丽小姐走出房间时感到有点尴尬。约克郡人看起来很奇怪，玛莎对她来说一直是个谜。起初她很不喜欢她，但现在她不喜欢了。跳绳是一件美妙的事情。她数啊，跳啊，跳啊，数啊，直到她的脸颊变得通红，她比她出生以来任何时候都感兴趣。阳光明媚，微风轻拂，不是狂风，而是一阵阵令人愉快的微风，带来一股新近变成泥土的清新气息。她在喷泉花园里蹦蹦跳跳，上上下下地走着。最后，她蹦蹦跳跳地来到菜园里，看见本 · 韦瑟斯塔夫正在挖土，还在和在他身边跳来跳去的知更鸟说话。她蹦蹦跳跳地走向他，他抬起头，用好奇的眼神看着她。她想知道他是否会注意到她。她想让他看到她逃跑。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“Well!” he exclaimed. “Upon my word. P’raps tha’

“Tha’ keep on,” said Ben. “Tha’ shapes well
enough at it for a young ’un that’s lived with heathen. Just see
how he’s watchin’ thee,” jerking his head toward the robin.
“He followed after thee yesterday. He’ll be at it again today.
He’ll be bound to find out what th’ skippin’-rope is.
He’s never seen one. Eh!” shaking his head at the bird,
“tha’ curiosity will be th’ death of thee sometime if
tha’ doesn’t look sharp.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“你继续说,”本说。“对于一个和异教徒生活在一起的年轻人来说，你的身材已经很好了”。看看他是怎么看你的,”他猛地把头转向知更鸟。”他昨天跟着你。他今天还会来的。他一定会发现跳绳是什么。他从没见过。呃!”他对着鸟摇了摇头，“如果你看起来不够锐利的话，有时候你的好奇心会要了你的命。”</p>

Mary skipped round all the gardens and round the orchard, resting every few
minutes. At length she went to her own special walk and made up her mind to try
if she could skip the whole length of it. It was a good long skip and she began
slowly, but before she had gone half-way down the path she was so hot and
breathless that she was obliged to stop. She did not mind much, because she had
already counted up to thirty. She stopped with a little laugh of pleasure, and
there, lo and behold, was the robin swaying on a long branch of ivy. He had
followed her and he greeted her with a chirp. As Mary had skipped toward him
she felt something heavy in her pocket strike against her at each jump, and
when she saw the robin she laughed again.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">玛丽绕着所有的花园和果园蹦蹦跳跳，每隔几分钟就休息一下。最后，她走上了自己的专属步道，下定决心要试试能否跳过整个步道。这是一个很长的跳跃，她开始缓慢，但是在她已经走了一半的道路，她是如此热和呼吸，她不得不停止。她不太在意，因为她已经数到三十了。她高兴地轻笑了一声，停了下来，瞧，知更鸟在常春藤的长枝上摇摆着。他跟在她后面，叽叽喳喳地跟她打招呼。当玛丽跳向他的时候，她感到口袋里有什么东西重重地打在她身上，当她看到知更鸟的时候，她又笑了。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“You showed me where the key was yesterday,” she said. “You
ought to show me the door today; but I don’t believe you know!”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“你昨天告诉我钥匙在哪里,”她说。“你今天应该让我看看门，但我相信你不知道!”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
The robin flew from his swinging spray of ivy on to the top of the wall and he
opened his beak and sang a loud, lovely trill, merely to show off. Nothing in
the world is quite as adorably lovely as a robin when he shows off—and
they are nearly always doing it.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">知更鸟从它那挥舞的常春藤飞到墙顶上，它张开嘴，发出响亮而可爱的颤音，仅仅是为了炫耀。世界上没有什么比知更鸟炫耀的时候更可爱的了ーー他们几乎总是这样做。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
Mary Lennox had heard a great deal about Magic in her Ayah’s stories, and
she always said that what happened almost at that moment was Magic.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">玛丽 · 伦诺克斯在她的阿亚的故事中听到了很多关于魔法的事情，她总是说，几乎在那一刻发生的事情就是魔法。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
One of the nice little gusts of wind rushed down the walk, and it was a
stronger one than the rest. It was strong enough to wave the branches of the
trees, and it was more than strong enough to sway the trailing sprays of
untrimmed ivy hanging from the wall. Mary had stepped close to the robin, and
suddenly the gust of wind swung aside some loose ivy trails, and more suddenly
still she jumped toward it and caught it in her hand. This she did because she
had seen something under it—a round knob which had been covered by the
leaves hanging over it. It was the knob of a door.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">一阵小风从人行道上吹来，比其他的风都大。它的力量强大到足以摇动树枝，也强大到足以摇动从墙上垂下来的未修剪的常春藤。玛丽已经走近了知更鸟，突然，一阵风刮开了一些松散的常春藤的痕迹，更突然，她跳向它，并抓住了它在她的手。她这样做是因为她看到了它下面有什么东西ーー一个圆形的把手，上面覆盖着树叶。是门把手。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
She put her hands under the leaves and began to pull and push them aside. Thick
as the ivy hung, it nearly all was a loose and swinging curtain, though some
had crept over wood and iron. Mary’s heart began to thump and her hands
to shake a little in her delight and excitement. The robin kept singing and
twittering away and tilting his head on one side, as if he were as excited as
she was. What was this under her hands which was square and made of iron and
which her fingers found a hole in?
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">她把手放在叶子下面，开始把它们拉到一边。虽然有些窗帘已经爬过了木头和铁皮，但它几乎和常春藤一样厚，是一块松散的、摇摆的窗帘。玛丽的心开始怦怦直跳，她的手因为高兴和兴奋而微微颤抖。知更鸟不停地唱歌，叽叽喳喳地叫着，把头偏向一边，好像他和她一样兴奋。她的手下面是什么东西，是方形的，是铁做的，她的手指在上面挖了个洞？</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
It was the lock of the door which had been closed ten years and she put her
hand in her pocket, drew out the key and found it fitted the keyhole. She put
the key in and turned it. It took two hands to do it, but it did turn.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">那是一把关了十年的门锁，她把手伸进口袋，掏出钥匙，发现它正好能插进钥匙孔。她把钥匙插进去转了一下。它用了两只手才做到，但它确实转动了。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
And then she took a long breath and looked behind her up the long walk to see
if anyone was coming. No one was coming. No one ever did come, it seemed, and
she took another long breath, because she could not help it, and she held back
the swinging curtain of ivy and pushed back the door which opened
slowly—slowly.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">然后她长长地吸了一口气，向后看了看有没有人来。没人会来。似乎从来没有人来过，她又长长地吸了一口气，因为她情不自禁，她拉住常春藤摇曳的帘子，把慢慢打开的门推了回去。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
Then she slipped through it, and shut it behind her, and stood with her back
against it, looking about her and breathing quite fast with excitement, and
wonder, and delight.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">然后她溜进去，把门关在身后，背靠着门站着，环顾四周，兴奋、惊奇、高兴地呼吸得很快。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
She was standing <i>inside</i> the secret garden.

THE STRANGEST HOUSE ANYONE EVER LIVED IN<font class="cyxy-trs-target"> 有史以来最奇怪的房子</font></h2>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
It was the sweetest, most mysterious-looking place anyone could imagine. The
high walls which shut it in were covered with the leafless stems of climbing
roses which were so thick that they were matted together. Mary Lennox knew they
were roses because she had seen a great many roses in India. All the ground was
covered with grass of a wintry brown and out of it grew clumps of bushes which
were surely rosebushes if they were alive. There were numbers of standard roses
which had so spread their branches that they were like little trees. There were
other trees in the garden, and one of the things which made the place look
strangest and loveliest was that climbing roses had run all over them and swung
down long tendrils which made light swaying curtains, and here and there they
had caught at each other or at a far-reaching branch and had crept from one
tree to another and made lovely bridges of themselves. There were neither
leaves nor roses on them now and Mary did not know whether they were dead or
alive, but their thin gray or brown branches and sprays looked like a sort of
hazy mantle spreading over everything, walls, and trees, and even brown grass,
where they had fallen from their fastenings and run along the ground. It was
this hazy tangle from tree to tree which made it all look so mysterious. Mary
had thought it must be different from other gardens which had not been left all
by themselves so long; and indeed it was different from any other place she had
ever seen in her life.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">那是人们能想象到的最甜蜜，最神秘的地方。把它关在里面的高墙上覆盖着无叶的攀缘玫瑰的茎，它们是如此的粗，以至于它们被缠在了一起。玛丽 · 伦诺克斯知道那是玫瑰，因为她在印度见过很多玫瑰。所有的地面都长满了冬天的棕色的草，从中长出一丛丛的灌木丛，如果它们还活着，那肯定是玫瑰丛。有许多标准的玫瑰花，它们的枝条伸展得像小树一样。花园里还有其他的树，让这个地方看起来最奇怪最可爱的事情之一就是爬满了玫瑰，它们垂下长长的卷须，形成轻微晃动的窗帘，它们在这里或那里相互缠绕，或者缠绕在一根长长的树枝上，从一棵树爬到另一棵树上，形成可爱的桥梁。它们上面既没有叶子也没有玫瑰，玛丽也不知道它们是死是活，但是它们细细的灰色或棕色的枝条和花枝看起来像是一种朦胧的斗篷，覆盖了一切，墙壁，树木，甚至是棕色的草，它们从围栏上掉下来，沿着地面奔跑。正是这种从一棵树到另一棵树的模糊缠绕，使得这一切看起来如此神秘。玛丽认为它一定不同于其他那些没有独自留下来那么长时间的花园，而且确实不同于她一生中见过的任何其他地方。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“How still it is!” she whispered. “How still!”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“好安静啊!”她低声说，“好安静啊!”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
Then she waited a moment and listened at the stillness. The robin, who had
flown to his treetop, was still as all the rest. He did not even flutter his
wings; he sat without stirring, and looked at Mary.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">然后她等了一会儿，静静地听着。知更鸟飞到树梢上，和其他鸟儿一样，一动不动。他甚至没有扇动他的翅膀; 他坐在那里一动不动，看着玛丽。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“No wonder it is still,” she whispered again. “I am the first
person who has spoken in here for ten years.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“难怪它是静止的,”她又低声说。“我是十年来第一个在这里发言的人”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
She moved away from the door, stepping as softly as if she were afraid of
awakening someone. She was glad that there was grass under her feet and that
her steps made no sounds. She walked under one of the fairy-like gray arches
between the trees and looked up at the sprays and tendrils which formed them.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">她从门边走开，轻轻地迈着步子，好像害怕吵醒什么人似的。她很高兴她的脚下有草，她的脚步没有发出声音。她走在树间一个像仙女一样的灰色拱门下，抬头看着形成它们的水花和卷须。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“I wonder if they are all quite dead,” she said. “Is it all a
quite dead garden? I wish it wasn’t.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“我不知道他们是不是都死了,”她说。“这是一个死气沉沉的花园吗？我希望它不是。”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
If she had been Ben Weatherstaff she could have told whether the wood was alive
by looking at it, but she could only see that there were only gray or brown
sprays and branches and none showed any signs of even a tiny leaf-bud anywhere.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">如果她是本 · 韦瑟斯塔夫，她可以通过观察木头来判断它是否是活的，但是她只能看到灰色或棕色的喷雾和树枝，没有任何迹象表明哪怕是一个小小的叶芽。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
But she was <i>inside</i> the wonderful garden and she could come through the
door under the ivy any time and she felt as if she had found a world all her
own.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">但是她在这个美丽的花园里，她可以随时从常春藤下面的门进来，她觉得好像找到了属于自己的世界。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
The sun was shining inside the four walls and the high arch of blue sky over
this particular piece of Misselthwaite seemed even more brilliant and soft than
it was over the moor. The robin flew down from his tree-top and hopped about or
flew after her from one bush to another. He chirped a good deal and had a very
busy air, as if he were showing her things. Everything was strange and silent
and she seemed to be hundreds of miles away from anyone, but somehow she did
not feel lonely at all. All that troubled her was her wish that she knew
whether all the roses were dead, or if perhaps some of them had lived and might
put out leaves and buds as the weather got warmer. She did not want it to be a
quite dead garden. If it were a quite alive garden, how wonderful it would be,
and what thousands of roses would grow on every side!
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">阳光在四面墙里面照耀着，高高的蓝天拱门笼罩着这片特别的米瑟斯韦特地区，似乎比荒原上的天空更加明亮、更加柔和。知更鸟从树顶上飞下来，在她身后跳来跳去，或者从一个灌木丛飞到另一个灌木丛。他叽叽喳喳地说个不停，一副很忙碌的样子，好像在给她看东西似的。一切都很奇怪，很安静，她似乎离任何人都有几百英里远，但是不知为什么，她一点也不觉得孤独。所有困扰她的是她希望她知道是否所有的玫瑰都死了，或者也许他们中的一些已经生活并且可能在天气变暖时伸出叶子和花蕾。她不想让它变成一个死气沉沉的花园。如果这是一个生机勃勃的花园，那该有多么美妙，四周会长满成千上万朵玫瑰！</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
Her skipping-rope had hung over her arm when she came in and after she had
walked about for a while she thought she would skip round the whole garden,
stopping when she wanted to look at things. There seemed to have been grass
paths here and there, and in one or two corners there were alcoves of evergreen
with stone seats or tall moss-covered flower urns in them.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">她进来的时候，手臂上还挂着跳绳，走了一会儿，她想在整个花园里跳一跳，想看东西的时候就停下来。这里似乎到处都有草地小径，在一两个角落里有常绿的壁龛，里面有石头座椅或长满苔藓的高大花坛。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
As she came near the second of these alcoves she stopped skipping. There had
once been a flowerbed in it, and she thought she saw something sticking out of
the black earth—some sharp little pale green points. She remembered what
Ben Weatherstaff had said and she knelt down to look at them.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">当她走近第二个壁龛时，她停止了蹦蹦跳跳。那里曾经有一个花坛，她觉得她看见有什么东西从黑色的土地上伸出来ーー一些尖锐的浅绿色的小点。她想起本 · 韦瑟斯塔夫说过的话，便跪下来看他们。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“Yes, they are tiny growing things and they <i>might</i> be crocuses or
snowdrops or daffodils,” she whispered.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“是的，它们是微小的生长物，它们可能是番红花、雪花莲或者水仙花,”她低声说。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
She bent very close to them and sniffed the fresh scent of the damp earth. She
liked it very much.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">她弯下腰靠近他们，嗅着潮湿泥土的新鲜气味，她非常喜欢这种气味。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“Perhaps there are some other ones coming up in other places,” she
said. “I will go all over the garden and look.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">她说: “也许在其他地方也会出现一些这样的情况。”。“我要去花园里到处看看。”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
She did not skip, but walked. She went slowly and kept her eyes on the ground.
She looked in the old border beds and among the grass, and after she had gone
round, trying to miss nothing, she had found ever so many more sharp, pale
green points, and she had become quite excited again.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">她没有蹦蹦跳跳，而是走着走着。她走得很慢，眼睛一直盯着地面。她在老旧的边界床上和草丛中寻找，在她转了一圈以后，尽量不要错过任何东西，她发现了更多的尖锐的、苍白的绿点，她又变得非常兴奋。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“It isn’t a quite dead garden,” she cried out softly to
herself. “Even if the roses are dead, there are other things
alive.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“这不是一个死气沉沉的花园,”她轻声地对自己喊道。“即使玫瑰死了，还有其他东西活着。”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
She did not know anything about gardening, but the grass seemed so thick in
some of the places where the green points were pushing their way through that
she thought they did not seem to have room enough to grow. She searched about
until she found a rather sharp piece of wood and knelt down and dug and weeded
out the weeds and grass until she made nice little clear places around them.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">她对园艺一窍不通，但是有些地方的草看起来很茂密，绿色的尖端正在向前推进，她认为它们似乎没有足够的空间来生长。她四处寻找，直到找到一块相当锋利的木头，她跪下来，把杂草和青草挖出来，除掉，直到在它们周围找到一个漂亮的小空地。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“Now they look as if they could breathe,” she said, after she had
finished with the first ones. “I am going to do ever so many more.
I’ll do all I can see. If I haven’t time today I can come
tomorrow.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“现在他们看起来好像可以呼吸了,”她说，在她完成了第一个。“我要做更多的事情。我会尽我所能。如果我今天没有时间，我可以明天来。”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
She went from place to place, and dug and weeded, and enjoyed herself so
immensely that she was led on from bed to bed and into the grass under the
trees. The exercise made her so warm that she first threw her coat off, and
then her hat, and without knowing it she was smiling down on to the grass and
the pale green points all the time.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">她从一个地方走到另一个地方，挖土、除草，她玩得非常开心，从一张床到另一张床，一直被带到树下的草丛里。这项运动使她感到非常温暖，她先是脱掉外套，然后脱掉帽子，不知不觉中，她一直笑着朝下面的草地和浅绿色的地方走去。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
The robin was tremendously busy. He was very much pleased to see gardening
begun on his own estate. He had often wondered at Ben Weatherstaff. Where
gardening is done all sorts of delightful things to eat are turned up with the
soil. Now here was this new kind of creature who was not half Ben’s size
and yet had had the sense to come into his garden and begin at once.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">知更鸟忙得不可开交。他非常高兴看到园艺开始在他自己的庄园。他常常对本 · 韦瑟斯塔夫感到好奇。在种植园艺的地方，各种令人愉快的食物随着土壤一起被翻出来。现在有了一种新的生物，它的体型还不及本的一半，但却有意识地走进他的花园，立刻开始了。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
Mistress Mary worked in her garden until it was time to go to her midday
dinner. In fact, she was rather late in remembering, and when she put on her
coat and hat, and picked up her skipping-rope, she could not believe that she
had been working two or three hours. She had been actually happy all the time;
and dozens and dozens of the tiny, pale green points were to be seen in cleared
places, looking twice as cheerful as they had looked before when the grass and
weeds had been smothering them.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">玛丽太太在花园里干活，直到该去吃中午饭的时候。事实上，她记得得太晚了，当她穿上外套，戴上帽子，拿起跳绳时，她简直不敢相信自己已经工作了两三个小时。事实上，她一直都很快乐; 在空旷的地方可以看到几十个细小的、苍白的绿点，看起来比草丛和杂草把它们压得喘不过气来的时候欢快了一倍。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“I shall come back this afternoon,” she said, looking all round at
her new kingdom, and speaking to the trees and the rose-bushes as if they heard
her.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“我今天下午就回来,”她说，环顾四周，看着她的新王国，对着树木和玫瑰花丛说话，仿佛他们听到了她的话。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
Then she ran lightly across the grass, pushed open the slow old door and
slipped through it under the ivy. She had such red cheeks and such bright eyes
and ate such a dinner that Martha was delighted.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">然后她轻轻地跑过草地，推开那扇缓慢的旧门，从常春藤下面溜了进去。她红扑扑的脸颊，明亮的眼睛，吃得那么丰盛，玛莎高兴极了。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“Two pieces o’ meat an’ two helps o’ rice
puddin’!” she said. “Eh! mother will be pleased when I tell
her what th’ skippin’-rope’s done for thee.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“两块肉，两块大米布丁!”她说。“呃！如果我告诉妈妈跳绳为你做了什么，妈妈会很高兴的。”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
In the course of her digging with her pointed stick Mistress Mary had found
herself digging up a sort of white root rather like an onion. She had put it
back in its place and patted the earth carefully down on it and just now she
wondered if Martha could tell her what it was.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">在她用尖棍挖土的过程中，玛丽太太发现自己挖到了一种白色的根，有点像洋葱。她把它放回原处，小心翼翼地在上面拍了拍，刚才她还在想玛莎能不能告诉她那是什么。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“Martha,” she said, “what are those white roots that look
like onions?”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“玛莎,”她说，“那些看起来像洋葱的白色根是什么?”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“They’re bulbs,” answered Martha. “Lots o’ spring
flowers grow from ’em. Th’ very little ones are snowdrops an’
crocuses an’ th’ big ones are narcissuses an’ jonquils and
daffydowndillys. Th’ biggest of all is lilies an’ purple flags. Eh!
they are nice. Dickon’s got a whole lot of ’em planted in our bit
o’ garden.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“它们是灯泡,”玛莎回答。“许多春天的花儿从他们身上生长出来。小的是雪花莲和番红花，大的是水仙花和长寿花和水仙花。最大的是百合和紫色的旗子。呃！他们很好。迪肯在我们的花园里种了很多。”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“Does Dickon know all about them?” asked Mary, a new idea taking
possession of her.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“狄肯知道他们的一切吗?”玛丽问道，一个新的想法占据了她的心。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“Our Dickon can make a flower grow out of a brick walk. Mother says he
just whispers things out o’ th’ ground.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“我们的狄肯可以让一朵花从砖路上长出来。妈妈说他只是把事情小声说出来</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“Do bulbs live a long time? Would they live years and years if no one
helped them?” inquired Mary anxiously.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“灯泡能活很长时间吗? 如果没有人帮助它们，它们能活很多年吗?”玛丽焦急地问道。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“They’re things as helps themselves,” said Martha.
“That’s why poor folk can afford to have ’em. If you
don’t trouble ’em, most of ’em’ll work away underground
for a lifetime an’ spread out an’ have little ’uns.
There’s a place in th’ park woods here where there’s
snowdrops by thousands. They’re the prettiest sight in Yorkshire when
th’ spring comes. No one knows when they was first planted.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“这些东西都是自助的,”玛莎说。“这就是为什么穷人能买得起。如果你不麻烦他们，他们中的大多数会在地下工作一辈子，然后分散开来生小孩。公园树林里有个地方有成千上万的雪花莲。当春天来临时，它们是约克郡最美丽的景色。没有人知道它们是什么时候第一次被种植的。”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“I wish the spring was here now,” said Mary. “I want to see
all the things that grow in England.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“我希望春天现在就在这里,”玛丽说，“我想看看英格兰生长的所有东西。”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
She had finished her dinner and gone to her favorite seat on the hearth-rug.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">她吃完晚饭，走到炉边地毯上她最喜欢的座位上。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“I wish—I wish I had a little spade,” she said.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“我希望，我希望我有一把小铁锹,”她说。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“Whatever does tha’ want a spade for?” asked Martha,
laughing. “Art tha’ goin’ to take to diggin’? I must

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
Mary looked at the fire and pondered a little. She must be careful if she meant
to keep her secret kingdom. She wasn’t doing any harm, but if Mr. Craven
found out about the open door he would be fearfully angry and get a new key and
lock it up forevermore. She really could not bear that.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">玛丽看着炉火，沉思了一会儿。如果她想保住她的秘密王国，就必须小心。她没有造成任何伤害，但是如果克雷文先生发现门开着，他会非常生气，拿到一把新钥匙，然后永远把它锁起来。她真的无法忍受。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“This is such a big lonely place,” she said slowly, as if she were
turning matters over in her mind. “The house is lonely, and the park is
lonely, and the gardens are lonely. So many places seem shut up. I never did
many things in India, but there were more people to look at—natives and
soldiers marching by—and sometimes bands playing, and my Ayah told me
stories. There is no one to talk to here except you and Ben Weatherstaff. And
you have to do your work and Ben Weatherstaff won’t speak to me often. I
thought if I had a little spade I could dig somewhere as he does, and I might
make a little garden if he would give me some seeds.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“这是一个很大的孤独的地方,”她慢慢地说，好像她正在把事情在她的心里。“房子是孤独的，公园是孤独的，花园是孤独的。很多地方看起来都很封闭。我在印度从来没有做过很多事情，但那里有更多的人可以看ーー当地人和行进中的士兵ーー有时还有乐队演奏，我的阿亚给我讲了很多故事。除了你和本 · 韦瑟斯塔夫，这里没人可以说话。你得做你的工作 Ben Weatherstaff 不会经常跟我说话。我想如果我有一把小铁锹，我就可以像他那样挖掘某个地方，如果他能给我一些种子，我就可以做一个小花园。”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
Martha’s face quite lighted up.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">玛莎的脸上露出喜色。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“There now!” she exclaimed, “if that wasn’t one of
th’ things mother said. She says, ‘There’s such a lot
o’ room in that big place, why don’t they give her a bit for
herself, even if she doesn’t plant nothin’ but parsley an’
radishes? She’d dig an’ rake away an’ be right down happy
over it.’ Them was the very words she said.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“就是现在!”她叫道，“如果妈妈不是这么说的话。她说，“那么大的地方有那么多空间，为什么他们不给她一点自己的空间，即使她除了欧芹和萝卜什么也不种?”？她会挖啊，耙啊，然后高高兴兴地坐下来。她就是这么说的</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“Were they?” said Mary. “How many things she knows,
doesn’t she?”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“是吗?”玛丽说。“她知道多少事情，不是吗?”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“Eh!” said Martha. “It’s like she says: ‘A woman
as brings up twelve children learns something besides her A B C.
Children’s as good as ’rithmetic to set you findin’ out
things.’”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“呃!”玛莎说。“就像她说的那样: ‘一个抚养了12个孩子的女人，除了她的 A-B-C 之外，还学到了一些东西。孩子们的算术和算术一样好，能让你发现一些东西。”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“How much would a spade cost—a little one?” Mary asked.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“一把铁锹要多少钱? 一把小的?”玛丽问。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“Well,” was Martha’s reflective answer, “at Thwaite
village there’s a shop or so an’ I saw little garden sets with a
spade an’ a rake an’ a fork all tied together for two shillings.
An’ they was stout enough to work with, too.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“嗯,”玛莎若有所思地回答，“在斯韦特村庄里有一家商店左右，‘我看到一个小花园，里面有一把铲子、一把耙子和一把叉子，它们全部用两先令绑在一起。他们也很结实，可以和他们一起工作。”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“I’ve got more than that in my purse,” said Mary. “Mrs.
Morrison gave me five shillings and Mrs. Medlock gave me some money from Mr.
Craven.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“我钱包里可不止这些,”玛丽说。“莫里森太太给了我五先令，梅德洛克太太从克雷文先生那里给了我一些钱。”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“Did he remember thee that much?” exclaimed Martha.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“他记得你这么清楚吗?”玛莎叫道。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“Mrs. Medlock said I was to have a shilling a week to spend. She gives me
one every Saturday. I didn’t know what to spend it on.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">梅德洛克夫人说我有一个星期的时间。她每周六都给我一个。我不知道该把钱花在什么地方。”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“My word! that’s riches,” said Martha. “Tha’ can
buy anything in th’ world tha’ wants. Th’ rent of our cottage
is only one an’ threepence an’ it’s like pullin’
eye-teeth to get it. Now I’ve just thought of somethin’,”
putting her hands on her hips.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“我的天！那就是财富,”玛莎说。在这个世界上，你可以买到任何你想要的东西。我们小屋的租金只有一便士三便士，要想租到它简直是难上加难。现在我想到了一件事,”她把手放在臀部上。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“What?” said Mary eagerly.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“什么?”玛丽急切地问。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“In the shop at Thwaite they sell packages o’ flower-seeds for a
penny each, and our Dickon he knows which is th’ prettiest ones an’
how to make ’em grow. He walks over to Thwaite many a day just for
th’ fun of it. Does tha’ know how to print letters?”
suddenly.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“在斯韦特的商店里，每包花籽售价一便士，我们的迪肯知道哪一个是最漂亮的，也知道如何让它们生长。为了好玩，他每天都去 Thwaite。你知道怎么打印信件吗?”突然。</p>

“I know how to write,” Mary answered.

Martha shook her head.

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“Our Dickon can only read printin’. If tha’ could print we

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“Oh! you’re a good girl!” Mary cried. “You are, really!
I didn’t know you were so nice. I know I can print letters if I try.
Let’s ask Mrs. Medlock for a pen and ink and some paper.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“哦！你是个好女孩!”玛丽哭了。“你是，真的！我不知道你人这么好。我知道如果我尝试，我可以打印信件。让我们向梅德洛克夫人要一支笔，一些墨水和一些纸。”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“I’ve got some of my own,” said Martha. “I bought
’em so I could print a bit of a letter to mother of a Sunday. I’ll
go and get it.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“我自己也有一些,”玛莎说。“我买它们是为了印一封给母亲的信。我去拿</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
She ran out of the room, and Mary stood by the fire and twisted her thin little
hands together with sheer pleasure.

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“If I have a spade,” she whispered, “I can make the earth
nice and soft and dig up weeds. If I have seeds and can make flowers grow the
garden won’t be dead at all—it will come alive.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“如果我有一把铁锹,”她低声说，“我就能把土地弄得又软又好，还能把杂草挖出来。”。如果我有种子，能让花朵生长，花园就不会死去ーー它就会活过来。”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
She did not go out again that afternoon because when Martha returned with her
pen and ink and paper she was obliged to clear the table and carry the plates
and dishes downstairs and when she got into the kitchen Mrs. Medlock was there
and told her to do something, so Mary waited for what seemed to her a long time
before she came back. Then it was a serious piece of work to write to Dickon.
Mary had been taught very little because her governesses had disliked her too
much to stay with her. She could not spell particularly well but she found that
she could print letters when she tried. This was the letter Martha dictated to
her:
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">那天下午她没有再出去，因为当玛莎带着她的钢笔、墨水和纸回来时，她不得不清理桌子，把盘子和盘子搬到楼下，当她走进厨房时，梅德洛克夫人在那里告诉她做点什么，所以玛丽等了好长时间才回来。那么给迪肯写信就是一件严肃的工作了。玛丽几乎没有受过什么教育，因为她的家庭教师太不喜欢她了，不愿意和她在一起。她拼写不是特别好，但她发现她可以打印字母时，她尝试。这是玛莎口述给她的信:</p>

“Now to think,” she broke out, “to think o’ me

Her work in the garden and the excitement of the afternoon ended by making her
feel quiet and thoughtful. Martha stayed with her until tea-time, but they sat
in comfortable quiet and talked very little. But just before Martha went
downstairs for the tea-tray, Mary asked a question.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">她在花园里的工作和下午的兴奋使她感到安静和深思熟虑。玛莎一直陪着她到下午茶时间，但是他们安静地坐着，很少说话。但就在玛莎下楼拿茶盘之前，玛丽问了一个问题。</p>

“Martha,” she said, “has the scullery-maid had the toothache

“What makes thee ask that?” she said.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“你为什么这么问?”她说。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“Because when I waited so long for you to come back I opened the door and
walked down the corridor to see if you were coming. And I heard that far-off
crying again, just as we heard it the other night. There isn’t a wind
today, so you see it couldn’t have been the wind.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“因为当我等你回来的时候，我打开门，沿着走廊走去，看你是否会来。我又听到远处的哭声，就像那天晚上我们听到的一样。今天没有风，所以不可能是风。”</p>

“Eh!” said Martha restlessly. “Tha’ mustn’t go

“It’s the strangest house anyone ever lived in,” said Mary
drowsily, as she dropped her head on the cushioned seat of the armchair near
her. Fresh air, and digging, and skipping-rope had made her feel so comfortably
tired that she fell asleep.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“这是有史以来住过的最奇怪的房子了,”玛丽说，她把头靠在靠近她的扶手椅的软垫上，昏昏欲睡。新鲜的空气、挖掘和跳绳使她感到非常舒服的疲倦，以至于她睡着了。</p>

DICKON</h2>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
The sun shone down for nearly a week on the secret garden. The Secret Garden
was what Mary called it when she was thinking of it. She liked the name, and
she liked still more the feeling that when its beautiful old walls shut her in
no one knew where she was. It seemed almost like being shut out of the world in
some fairy place. The few books she had read and liked had been fairy-story
books, and she had read of secret gardens in some of the stories. Sometimes
people went to sleep in them for a hundred years, which she had thought must be
rather stupid. She had no intention of going to sleep, and, in fact, she was
becoming wider awake every day which passed at Misselthwaite. She was beginning
to like to be out of doors; she no longer hated the wind, but enjoyed it. She
could run faster, and longer, and she could skip up to a hundred. The bulbs in
the secret garden must have been much astonished. Such nice clear places were
made round them that they had all the breathing space they wanted, and really,
if Mistress Mary had known it, they began to cheer up under the dark earth and
work tremendously. The sun could get at them and warm them, and when the rain
came down it could reach them at once, so they began to feel very much alive.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">太阳在秘密花园里照了将近一个星期。玛丽想起来的时候就叫它秘密花园。她喜欢这个名字，她更喜欢这种感觉，当美丽的老墙把她关在里面时，没有人知道她在哪里。感觉就像被关在仙境之外。她读过和喜欢的几本书都是童话故事书，有些故事里还有秘密花园的故事。有时人们穿着睡衣睡了一百年，她觉得这一定很愚蠢。她根本不想睡觉，事实上，在 Misselthwaite 的日子里，她每天都变得越来越清醒。她开始喜欢户外活动了; 她不再讨厌风，而是喜欢它。她可以跑得更快，更长，她可以跳到一百。秘密花园里的鳞茎植物一定很惊讶。他们周围是如此清晰的空间，以至于他们有足够的喘息空间，事实上，如果玛丽小姐知道的话，他们在黑暗的土地下开始兴奋起来，并且非常努力地工作。阳光可以照射到他们身上，使他们暖和起来，当雨水落下来的时候，阳光可以立刻照射到他们身上，所以他们开始感到非常有活力。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
Mary was an odd, determined little person, and now she had something
interesting to be determined about, she was very much absorbed, indeed. She
worked and dug and pulled up weeds steadily, only becoming more pleased with
her work every hour instead of tiring of it. It seemed to her like a
fascinating sort of play. She found many more of the sprouting pale green
points than she had ever hoped to find. They seemed to be starting up
everywhere and each day she was sure she found tiny new ones, some so tiny that
they barely peeped above the earth. There were so many that she remembered what
Martha had said about the “snowdrops by the thousands,” and about
bulbs spreading and making new ones. These had been left to themselves for ten
years and perhaps they had spread, like the snowdrops, into thousands. She
wondered how long it would be before they showed that they were flowers.
Sometimes she stopped digging to look at the garden and try to imagine what it
would be like when it was covered with thousands of lovely things in bloom.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">玛丽是一个古怪的，有决心的小人物，现在她有一些有趣的事情需要决心，她确实非常专心致志。她不停地工作、挖掘、拔除杂草，只是对每小时的工作越来越满意，而不是越来越厌倦。对她来说，这似乎是一出迷人的戏剧。她发现了许多发芽的淡绿色的点，比她曾经希望发现的要多得多。它们似乎无处不在，每天她都确信自己能找到新的小东西，有些小到几乎看不到地面。有这么多，她记得玛莎所说的“成千上万的雪花莲”，以及关于球茎蔓延和制造新的。它们已经独自生活了十年，也许它们已经像雪花莲一样蔓延到了数千个地方。她不知道要过多久他们才能证明那是花。有时候，她停下来看看花园，试着想象一下，当花园被成千上万朵可爱的花朵覆盖时，会是什么样子。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
During that week of sunshine, she became more intimate with Ben Weatherstaff.
She surprised him several times by seeming to start up beside him as if she
sprang out of the earth. The truth was that she was afraid that he would pick
up his tools and go away if he saw her coming, so she always walked toward him
as silently as possible. But, in fact, he did not object to her as strongly as
he had at first. Perhaps he was secretly rather flattered by her evident desire
for his elderly company. Then, also, she was more civil than she had been. He
did not know that when she first saw him she spoke to him as she would have
spoken to a native, and had not known that a cross, sturdy old Yorkshire man
was not accustomed to salaam to his masters, and be merely commanded by them to
do things.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">在那一周的阳光下，她和本 · 韦瑟斯塔夫变得更加亲密了。她好几次都让他大吃一惊，她好像从地里蹦出来似的，从他身边跳了起来。事实上，她害怕他看到她过来就会拿起工具走开，所以她总是尽可能地悄悄地走向他。但事实上，他并没有像一开始那样强烈地反对她。也许他暗地里对她显然渴望与他共度余生感到很高兴。而且，她比以前更有礼貌了。他不知道，当她第一次见到他的时候，她对他说话就像对一个当地人说话一样，也不知道一个十字架，健壮的约克郡老人不习惯向他的主人问好，只是被他们命令做事。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“Tha’rt like th’ robin,” he said to her one morning
when he lifted his head and saw her standing by him. “I never knows when
I shall see thee or which side tha’ll come from.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“这就像知更鸟,”一天早晨，他抬起头，看到她站在他身边，他对她说。“我不知道什么时候才能见到你，也不知道你从哪边来”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“He’s friends with me now,” said Mary.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“他现在是我的朋友了,”玛丽说。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“That’s like him,” snapped Ben Weatherstaff.
“Makin’ up to th’ women folk just for vanity an’
flightiness. There’s nothin’ he wouldn’t do for th’
sake o’ showin’ off an’ flirtin’ his tail-feathers.
He’s as full o’ pride as an egg’s full o’ meat.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“这就是他,”本 · 韦瑟斯塔夫厉声说。“为了虚荣和轻浮，去迎合那些女人”。为了炫耀和调情，他什么都做得出来。他就像鸡蛋里的肉一样骄傲”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
He very seldom talked much and sometimes did not even answer Mary’s
questions except by a grunt, but this morning he said more than usual. He stood
up and rested one hobnailed boot on the top of his spade while he looked her
over.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">他很少说话，有时甚至不回答玛丽的问题，只是咕哝一声，但今天早上他说得比平时多。他站起来，把一只钉鞋钉的靴子搁在铁锹上，仔细打量着她。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“How long has tha’ been here?” he jerked out.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“你在这儿多久了?”他突然问道。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“I think it’s about a month,” she answered.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“我想大概一个月吧,”她回答。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“Tha’s beginnin’ to do Misselthwaite credit,” he said.
“Tha’s a bit fatter than tha’ was an’ tha’s not
quite so yeller. Tha’ looked like a young plucked crow when tha’
first came into this garden. Thinks I to myself I never set eyes on an uglier,
sourer faced young ’un.”

Mary was not vain and as she had never thought much of her looks she was not
greatly disturbed.

<p class="cyxy-trs-source">
There, indeed, was the robin, and she thought he looked nicer than ever. His
red waistcoat was as glossy as satin and he flirted his wings and tail and
tilted his head and hopped about with all sorts of lively graces. He seemed
determined to make Ben Weatherstaff admire him. But Ben was sarcastic.
</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source">
“Aye, there tha’ art!” he said. “Tha’ can put up
with me for a bit sometimes when tha’s got no one better. Tha’s

“Oh! look at him!” exclaimed Mary.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“噢! 看看他!”玛丽叫道。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
The robin was evidently in a fascinating, bold mood. He hopped closer and
closer and looked at Ben Weatherstaff more and more engagingly. He flew on to
the nearest currant bush and tilted his head and sang a little song right at
him.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">知更鸟显然处于一种迷人的、大胆的心情中。他越跳越近，越来越投入地看着本 · 韦瑟斯塔夫。他飞到最近的葡萄树丛，歪着头对着他唱了一首小歌。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“Tha’ thinks tha’ll get over me by doin’ that,”
said Ben, wrinkling his face up in such a way that Mary felt sure he was trying
not to look pleased. “Tha’ thinks no one can stand out against
thee—that’s what tha’ thinks.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“你以为这样就能忘掉我了,”本说，皱起了脸，玛丽觉得他是故意装出不高兴的样子。“你认为没有人可以站出来反对你，这就是你的想法。”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
The robin spread his wings—Mary could scarcely believe her eyes. He flew
right up to the handle of Ben Weatherstaff’s spade and alighted on the
top of it. Then the old man’s face wrinkled itself slowly into a new
expression. He stood still as if he were afraid to breathe—as if he would
not have stirred for the world, lest his robin should start away. He spoke
quite in a whisper.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">知更鸟展开翅膀ーー玛丽简直不敢相信自己的眼睛。他径直飞到本 · 韦瑟斯塔夫铁锹的把手上，落在上面。然后老人的脸慢慢地皱了起来，露出了新的表情。他一动不动地站着，好像害怕呼吸一样ーー好像他不会为这个世界而激动，生怕他的知更鸟会飞走。他说话声音很小。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“Well, I’m danged!” he said as softly as if he were saying
something quite different. “Tha’ does know how to get at a

</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“好吧，我被吊死了!”他轻轻地说，好像在说一些完全不同的话。“你确实知道如何抓住一个小伙子——你确实知道！这真是太不可思议了，这真是太神奇了。”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source">
And he stood without stirring—almost without drawing his
breath—until the robin gave another flirt to his wings and flew away.
Then he stood looking at the handle of the spade as if there might be Magic in
it, and then he began to dig again and said nothing for several minutes.
</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
But because he kept breaking into a slow grin now and then, Mary was not afraid
to talk to him.

</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“你喜欢玫瑰吗?”她问。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source">
Ben Weatherstaff rooted up a weed and threw it aside before he answered.
</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source">
“Well, yes, I do. I was learned that by a young lady I was gardener to.
She had a lot in a place she was fond of, an’ she loved ’em like
they was children—or robins. I’ve seen her bend over an’ kiss
’em.” He dragged out another weed and scowled at it. “That
were as much as ten year’ ago.”
</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source">
“Where is she now?” asked Mary, much interested.
</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source">
“Heaven,” he answered, and drove his spade deep into the soil,
“’cording to what parson says.”
</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source">
“What happened to the roses?” Mary asked again, more interested
than ever.
</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“They was left to themselves.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“他们被留给了自己。”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
Mary was becoming quite excited.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">玛丽变得非常兴奋。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source">
“Did they quite die? Do roses quite die when they are left to
themselves?” she ventured.
</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source">
“Well, I’d got to like ’em—an’ I liked
her—an’ she liked ’em,” Ben Weatherstaff admitted
reluctantly. “Once or twice a year I’d go an’ work at
’em a bit—prune ’em an’ dig about th’ roots. They
run wild, but they was in rich soil, so some of ’em lived.”
</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source">
“When they have no leaves and look gray and brown and dry, how can you
tell whether they are dead or alive?” inquired Mary.
</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source">
“Wait till th’ spring gets at ’em—wait till th’
sun shines on th’ rain and th’ rain falls on th’ sunshine
an’ then tha’ll find out.”
</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source">
“How—how?” cried Mary, forgetting to be careful.
</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source">
“Look along th’ twigs an’ branches an’ if tha’
see a bit of a brown lump swelling here an’ there, watch it after
th’ warm rain an’ see what happens.” He stopped suddenly and
looked curiously at her eager face. “Why does tha’ care so much
about roses an’ such, all of a sudden?” he demanded.
</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source">
Mistress Mary felt her face grow red. She was almost afraid to answer.
</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source">
“I—I want to play that—that I have a garden of my own,”
she stammered. “I—there is nothing for me to do. I have
nothing—and no one.”
</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source">
“Well,” said Ben Weatherstaff slowly, as he watched her,
“that’s true. Tha’ hasn’t.”
</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source">
He said it in such an odd way that Mary wondered if he was actually a little
sorry for her. She had never felt sorry for herself; she had only felt tired
and cross, because she disliked people and things so much. But now the world
seemed to be changing and getting nicer. If no one found out about the secret
garden, she should enjoy herself always.
</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source">
She stayed with him for ten or fifteen minutes longer and asked him as many
questions as she dared. He answered everyone of them in his queer grunting way
and he did not seem really cross and did not pick up his spade and leave her.
He said something about roses just as she was going away and it reminded her of
the ones he had said he had been fond of.
</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source">
“Do you go and see those other roses now?” she asked.
</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source">
“Not been this year. My rheumatics has made me too stiff in th’
joints.”
</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source">
He said it in his grumbling voice, and then quite suddenly he seemed to get
angry with her, though she did not see why he should.
</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source">
“Now look here!” he said sharply. “Don’t tha’ ask
so many questions. Tha’rt th’ worst wench for askin’
questions I’ve ever come across. Get thee gone an’ play thee.
I’ve done talkin’ for today.”
</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source">
And he said it so crossly that she knew there was not the least use in staying
another minute. She went skipping slowly down the outside walk, thinking him
over and saying to herself that, queer as it was, here was another person whom
she liked in spite of his crossness. She liked old Ben Weatherstaff. Yes, she
did like him. She always wanted to try to make him talk to her. Also she began
to believe that he knew everything in the world about flowers.
</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
There was a laurel-hedged walk which curved round the secret garden and ended
at a gate which opened into a wood, in the park. She thought she would slip
round this walk and look into the wood and see if there were any rabbits
hopping about. She enjoyed the skipping very much and when she reached the
little gate she opened it and went through because she heard a low, peculiar
whistling sound and wanted to find out what it was.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">公园里有一条带有月桂树篱笆的小路，绕过秘密花园，最后到达一扇通往树林的大门。她想她可以绕过这条小路，往树林里看看，看看有没有兔子在跳来跳去。她非常喜欢这种跳跃，当她到达小门时，她打开门走了进去，因为她听到了一种低沉的、奇怪的口哨声，她想知道那是什么。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
It was a very strange thing indeed. She quite caught her breath as she stopped
to look at it. A boy was sitting under a tree, with his back against it,
playing on a rough wooden pipe. He was a funny looking boy about twelve. He
looked very clean and his nose turned up and his cheeks were as red as poppies
and never had Mistress Mary seen such round and such blue eyes in any
boy’s face. And on the trunk of the tree he leaned against, a brown
squirrel was clinging and watching him, and from behind a bush nearby a cock
pheasant was delicately stretching his neck to peep out, and quite near him
were two rabbits sitting up and sniffing with tremulous noses—and
actually it appeared as if they were all drawing near to watch him and listen
to the strange low little call his pipe seemed to make.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">这确实是一件非常奇怪的事情。当她停下来看它时，她屏住了呼吸。一个男孩坐在一棵树下，背靠着树，在一根粗糙的木管上玩耍。他是一个长相滑稽的男孩，大约十二岁。他看起来很干净，鼻子翘起来，脸颊红得像罂粟花，玛丽太太从来没有见过任何一个男孩的脸上有这么圆，这么蓝的眼睛。他靠在树干上，一只棕色的松鼠紧贴着他，注视着他，附近的灌木丛后面，一只公鸡正小心翼翼地伸长脖子向外窥视，在他很近的地方，有两只兔子正坐在那里，用颤抖的鼻子嗅着——实际上，它们似乎都在凑近来看他，听他的烟斗似乎发出的奇怪的低沉的叫声。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source">
When he saw Mary he held up his hand and spoke to her in a voice almost as low
as and rather like his piping.
</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source">
“Don’t tha’ move,” he said. “It’d flight
’em.”
</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
Mary remained motionless. He stopped playing his pipe and began to rise from
the ground. He moved so slowly that it scarcely seemed as though he were moving
at all, but at last he stood on his feet and then the squirrel scampered back
up into the branches of his tree, the pheasant withdrew his head and the
rabbits dropped on all fours and began to hop away, though not at all as if
they were frightened.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">玛丽一动不动。他停止吹笛子，开始从地上站起来。他的动作非常缓慢，几乎看不出他在动，但最后他站了起来，然后松鼠蹦蹦跳跳地回到他的树枝上，野鸡缩回他的头，兔子四肢着地，开始跳开，尽管它们一点也不害怕。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source">
“I’m Dickon,” the boy said. “I know tha’rt Miss
Mary.”
</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
Then Mary realized that somehow she had known at first that he was Dickon. Who
else could have been charming rabbits and pheasants as the natives charm snakes
in India? He had a wide, red, curving mouth and his smile spread all over his
face.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">然后玛丽意识到，不知怎的，她一开始就知道他就是迪肯。在印度，还有谁能像当地人那样迷人地迷住兔子和野鸡呢？他有一张宽大的、红色的、弯曲的嘴巴，他的笑容满脸都是。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source">
“I got up slow,” he explained, “because if tha’ makes a
quick move it startles ’em. A body ’as to move gentle an’
speak low when wild things is about.”
</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
He did not speak to her as if they had never seen each other before but as if
he knew her quite well. Mary knew nothing about boys and she spoke to him a
little stiffly because she felt rather shy.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">他没有跟她说话，好像他们以前从来没有见过面似的，而是好像他很了解她似的。玛丽对男孩子一无所知，她对他说话有点生硬，因为她觉得很害羞。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source">
“Did you get Martha’s letter?” she asked.
</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
He nodded his curly, rust-colored head.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">他点了点他那卷曲的铁锈色的头。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“That’s why I come.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“这就是我来的原因”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source">
He stooped to pick up something which had been lying on the ground beside him
when he piped.
</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“I’ve got th’ garden tools. There’s a little spade
an’ rake an’ a fork an’ hoe. Eh! they are good ’uns.
There’s a trowel, too. An’ th’ woman in th’ shop threw
in a packet o’ white poppy an’ one o’ blue larkspur when I
bought th’ other seeds.”

“Will you show the seeds to me?” Mary said.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“你能把种子给我看看吗?”玛丽说。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
She wished she could talk as he did. His speech was so quick and easy. It
sounded as if he liked her and was not the least afraid she would not like him,
though he was only a common moor boy, in patched clothes and with a funny face
and a rough, rusty-red head. As she came closer to him she noticed that there
was a clean fresh scent of heather and grass and leaves about him, almost as if
he were made of them. She liked it very much and when she looked into his funny
face with the red cheeks and round blue eyes she forgot that she had felt shy.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">她希望自己能像他那样说话。他的演讲又快又简单。听起来他似乎很喜欢她，一点也不担心她会不喜欢他，尽管他只是一个普通的沼地男孩，衣服上打着补丁，长着一张滑稽的脸和一个粗糙的、锈红色的头。当她走近他的时候，她注意到他身上有一股清新的石南花、青草和树叶的气味，好像他是由它们组成的一样。她非常喜欢它，当她看着他那张有着红红的脸颊和圆圆的蓝眼睛的滑稽的脸时，她忘记了她曾经感到害羞。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“Let us sit down on this log and look at them,” she said.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“让我们坐在这根圆木上看看它们,”她说。</p>

They sat down and he took a clumsy little brown paper package out of his coat

smaller packages with a picture of a flower on each one.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">他们坐下来，他从上衣口袋里拿出一个笨拙的棕色小纸包。他解开绳子，里面有许多更整齐、更小的包裹，每个包裹上都有一朵花的图案。</p>

“There’s a lot o’ mignonette an’ poppies,” he

He stopped and turned his head quickly, his poppy-cheeked face lighting up.

“Aye,” said Dickon, as if it was the most natural thing in the

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
He moved quite close to the bush with the slow movement Mary had noticed
before, and then he made a sound almost like the robin’s own twitter. The
robin listened a few seconds, intently, and then answered quite as if he were
replying to a question.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">他以玛丽之前注意到的缓慢动作靠近灌木丛，然后他发出了几乎像知更鸟自己的叽叽喳喳声一样的声音。知更鸟认真地听了几秒钟，然后回答了，好像在回答一个问题。</p>

“Aye, he’s a friend o’ yours,” chuckled Dickon.

“He wouldn’t come near thee if he didn’t,” answered
Dickon. “Birds is rare choosers an’ a robin can flout a body worse

And it really seemed as if it must be true. He so sidled and twittered and

“Do you understand everything birds say?” said Mary.

<p class="cyxy-trs-source">
Dickon’s grin spread until he seemed all wide, red, curving mouth, and he

He laughed and came back to the log and began to talk about the flower seeds

don’t know what I should do if anyone found it out. I believe I should
die!” She said the last sentence quite fiercely.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“我对男孩子一无所知,”她慢慢地说。如果我告诉你一个秘密，你能保守吗？这是个大秘密。如果被人发现了，我不知道该怎么办。我相信我该死!”她最后一句话说得很激烈。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source">
Dickon looked more puzzled than ever and even rubbed his hand over his rough
head again, but he answered quite good-humoredly.
</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“I’m keepin’ secrets all th’ time,” he said.
“If I couldn’t keep secrets from th’ other lads, secrets
about foxes’ cubs, an’ birds’ nests, an’ wild
things’ holes, there’d be naught safe on th’ moor. Aye, I can
keep secrets.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“我一直在保守秘密,”他说。“如果我不能对其他小伙子保守秘密，不能对狐狸的幼崽保守秘密，不能对‘鸟巢’保守秘密，不能对‘野生动物’保守秘密，荒原上就没有安全可言。是的，我可以保守秘密”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source">
Mistress Mary did not mean to put out her hand and clutch his sleeve but she
did it.
</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“I’ve stolen a garden,” she said very fast. “It
isn’t mine. It isn’t anybody’s. Nobody wants it, nobody cares
for it, nobody ever goes into it. Perhaps everything is dead in it already. I
don’t know.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“我偷了一个花园,”她很快地说。不是我的。不是任何人的。没有人想要，没有人关心，也没有人去做。也许里面的一切都已经死了。我不知道。”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
She began to feel hot and as contrary as she had ever felt in her life.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">她开始觉得热和反对，因为她曾经觉得在她的生活。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“I don’t care, I don’t care! Nobody has any right to take it
from me when I care about it and they don’t. They’re letting it
die, all shut in by itself,” she ended passionately, and she threw her
arms over her face and burst out crying—poor little Mistress Mary.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“我不在乎，我不在乎！当我在乎的时候，没人有权利拿走它，他们也没有。她激动地结束了这一切，她用双臂捂住自己的脸，突然大哭起来——可怜的小玛丽太太。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
Dickon’s curious blue eyes grew rounder and rounder.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">迪肯那双好奇的蓝眼睛越来越圆了。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“Eh-h-h!” he said, drawing his exclamation out slowly, and the way
he did it meant both wonder and sympathy.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“啊——啊——啊!”他说着，慢慢地把他的惊叹声拉出来，他这样做既表示惊奇，又表示同情。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“I’ve nothing to do,” said Mary. “Nothing belongs to
me. I found it myself and I got into it myself. I was only just like the robin,
and they wouldn’t take it from the robin.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“我无事可做,”玛丽说。“没有什么属于我。我自己找到的，然后自己动手了。我只是像知更鸟一样，他们不会从知更鸟那里抢走它。”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“Where is it?” asked Dickon in a dropped voice.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“它在哪儿?”迪肯压低声音问。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
Mistress Mary got up from the log at once. She knew she felt contrary again,
and obstinate, and she did not care at all. She was imperious and Indian, and
at the same time hot and sorrowful.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">玛丽小姐立刻从木头上站起来。她知道自己又感到矛盾和顽固了，她一点也不在乎。她既专横又印度化，同时又热情又悲伤。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“Come with me and I’ll show you,” she said.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“跟我来，我给你看,”她说。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
She led him round the laurel path and to the walk where the ivy grew so
thickly. Dickon followed her with a queer, almost pitying, look on his face. He
felt as if he were being led to look at some strange bird’s nest and must
move softly. When she stepped to the wall and lifted the hanging ivy he
started. There was a door and Mary pushed it slowly open and they passed in
together, and then Mary stood and waved her hand round defiantly.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">她领着他绕过月桂园的小路，来到爬满常春藤的小路上。迪肯跟在她后面，脸上带着一种古怪的、几乎是怜悯的表情。他觉得自己好像被引导着去看一些奇怪的鸟巢，必须轻轻地移动。当她走到墙边，举起挂着的常春藤时，他开始了。有一扇门，玛丽慢慢地推开，他们一起走了进去，然后玛丽站了起来，挑衅地挥了挥手。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“It’s this,” she said. “It’s a secret garden, and
I’m the only one in the world who wants it to be alive.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“就是这个,”她说。“这是一个秘密花园，我是这个世界上唯一一个希望它活着的人。”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
Dickon looked round and round about it, and round and round again.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">迪肯环顾四周，又环顾四周。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“Eh!” he almost whispered, “it is a queer, pretty place!
It’s like as if a body was in a dream.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“啊!”他几乎低声说，“这是一个奇怪的，美丽的地方! 就像一个身体在梦里。”</p>

THE NEST OF THE MISSEL THRUSH<font class="cyxy-trs-target"> 导弹的巢穴</font></h2>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
For two or three minutes he stood looking round him, while Mary watched him,
and then he began to walk about softly, even more lightly than Mary had walked
the first time she had found herself inside the four walls. His eyes seemed to
be taking in everything—the gray trees with the gray creepers climbing
over them and hanging from their branches, the tangle on the walls and among
the grass, the evergreen alcoves with the stone seats and tall flower urns
standing in them.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">有两三分钟他站在那里环顾四周，玛丽注视着他，然后他开始轻轻地走动，甚至比玛丽第一次发现自己在四面墙里走动时还要轻。他的眼睛似乎看到了一切——灰色的树木，上面爬满了灰色的攀缘植物，从树枝上垂下来; 墙上和草丛中的纠缠; 常绿的壁龛，石头座椅，高高的花坛。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“I never thought I’d see this place,” he said at last, in a
whisper.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“我从没想过我会见到这个地方,”他最后低声说。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“Did you know about it?” asked Mary.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“你知道这件事吗?”玛丽问。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source">
She had spoken aloud and he made a sign to her.
</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source">
“We must talk low,” he said, “or someone’ll hear us
an’ wonder what’s to do in here.”
</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source">
“Oh! I forgot!” said Mary, feeling frightened and putting her hand
quickly against her mouth. “Did you know about the garden?” she
asked again when she had recovered herself.
</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
Dickon nodded.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">迪肯点点头。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source">
“Martha told me there was one as no one ever went inside,” he
answered. “Us used to wonder what it was like.”
</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source">
He stopped and looked round at the lovely gray tangle about him, and his round
eyes looked queerly happy.
</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“Eh! the nests as’ll be here come springtime,” he said.
“It’d be th’ safest nestin’ place in England. No one
never comin’ near an’ tangles o’ trees an’ roses to
build in. I wonder all th’ birds on th’ moor don’t build
here.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“呃！春天的时候这里就会有鸟巢了。”他说。这是英国最安全的筑巢地。没有人会靠近缠绕在一起的树木和玫瑰。我想知道荒原上的鸟儿不都是在这里建造的。”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source">
Mistress Mary put her hand on his arm again without knowing it.
</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source">
“Will there be roses?” she whispered. “Can you tell? I
thought perhaps they were all dead.”
</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source">
“Eh! No! Not them—not all of ’em!” he answered.
“Look here!”
</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
He stepped over to the nearest tree—an old, old one with gray lichen all
over its bark, but upholding a curtain of tangled sprays and branches. He took
a thick knife out of his pocket and opened one of its blades.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">他走到最近的一棵树旁ーー一棵很老很老的树，树皮上长满了灰色的苔藓，但是树上却挂着一道由纠结的花枝和树枝组成的帘子。他从口袋里掏出一把厚厚的刀，打开刀刃。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“There’s lots o’ dead wood as ought to be cut out,” he
said. “An’ there’s a lot o’ old wood, but it made some
new last year. This here’s a new bit,” and he touched a shoot which
looked brownish green instead of hard, dry gray.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“这里有很多枯木，应该砍掉,”他说。“这里有很多旧木头，但是去年又做了一些新的。这是一个全新的部分,”他摸了摸一棵嫩芽，它看起来是棕绿色的，而不是硬硬的、干干的灰色。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source">
Mary touched it herself in an eager, reverent way.
</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source">
“That one?” she said. “Is that one quite alive quite?”
</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
Dickon curved his wide smiling mouth.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">迪肯弯起他那张笑眯眯的大嘴。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source">
“It’s as wick as you or me,” he said; and Mary remembered
that Martha had told her that “wick” meant “alive” or
“lively.”
</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“I’m glad it’s wick!” she cried out in her whisper.
“I want them all to be wick. Let us go round the garden and count how
many wick ones there are.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“我很高兴它是灯芯!”她低声地叫了起来。“我希望他们都是灯芯。让我们绕着花园走一圈，数一数有多少个灯芯。”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
She quite panted with eagerness, and Dickon was as eager as she was. They went
from tree to tree and from bush to bush. Dickon carried his knife in his hand
and showed her things which she thought wonderful.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">她急切地喘着气，狄肯也和她一样急切。他们从一棵树走到另一棵树，从一丛灌木走到另一丛灌木。迪肯手里拿着刀，给她看了一些她认为很美妙的东西。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“They’ve run wild,” he said, “but th’ strongest
ones has fair thrived on it. The delicatest ones has died out, but th’
others has growed an’ growed, an’ spread an’ spread, till
they’s a wonder. See here!” and he pulled down a thick gray,
dry-looking branch. “A body might think this was dead wood, but I
don’t believe it is—down to th’ root. I’ll cut it low
down an’ see.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“它们已经疯狂了,”他说，“但是最强壮的那些却在它们身上茁壮成长。”。最脆弱的已经灭绝了，但是其他的已经长大了，长大了，扩散了，直到它们成为一个奇迹。看这里!”他拉下一根粗大的、灰色的、看起来很干燥的树枝。“尸体可能会认为这是枯木，但我不相信这是——从头到尾。我会把它切得很低，然后看看。”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source">
He knelt and with his knife cut the lifeless-looking branch through, not far
above the earth.
</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source">
“There!” he said exultantly. “I told thee so. There’s
green in that wood yet. Look at it.”
</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source">
Mary was down on her knees before he spoke, gazing with all her might.
</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“When it looks a bit greenish an’ juicy like that, it’s
wick,” he explained. “When th’ inside is dry an’ breaks
easy, like this here piece I’ve cut off, it’s done for.
There’s a big root here as all this live wood sprung out of, an’ if
th’ old wood’s cut off an’ it’s dug round, and took
care of there’ll be—” he stopped and lifted his face to look
up at the climbing and hanging sprays above him—“there’ll be
a fountain o’ roses here this summer.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“当它看起来有点绿色和多汁的时候，它就是灯芯,”他解释说。“当里面干了，很容易破裂，就像我切下来的这一块，完蛋了。这里有一个很大的根，因为所有这些活的木头都是从这里长出来的，如果这些老木头被砍掉了，它们就会被挖圆，然后就会有了ーー”他停下脚步，抬起头来，看着头顶上的攀爬和悬挂的喷雾ーー“今年夏天这里将会有一个玫瑰喷泉。”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
They went from bush to bush and from tree to tree. He was very strong and
clever with his knife and knew how to cut the dry and dead wood away, and could
tell when an unpromising bough or twig had still green life in it. In the
course of half an hour Mary thought she could tell too, and when he cut through
a lifeless-looking branch she would cry out joyfully under her breath when she
caught sight of the least shade of moist green. The spade, and hoe, and fork
were very useful. He showed her how to use the fork while he dug about roots
with the spade and stirred the earth and let the air in.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">他们从一丛灌木走到另一丛灌木，从一棵树走到另一棵树。他非常强壮和聪明，他的刀，并知道如何削减干燥和枯死的木材，并能告诉时，一个没有希望的树枝或嫩枝仍然绿色的生命在其中。过了半个小时，玛丽觉得自己也看出来了，当他砍断一根毫无生气的树枝时，当她看到一点点湿润的绿色时，她就会在她的呼吸下欢快地叫出来。铁锹、锄头和叉子都很有用。他教她如何使用叉子，同时用铁锹挖掘树根，搅动土壤，让空气进入。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source">
They were working industriously round one of the biggest standard roses when he
caught sight of something which made him utter an exclamation of surprise.
</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source">
“Why!” he cried, pointing to the grass a few feet away. “Who
did that there?”
</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source">
It was one of Mary’s own little clearings round the pale green points.
</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“I did it,” said Mary.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“我做到了,”玛丽说。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source">
“Why, I thought tha’ didn’t know nothin’ about
gardenin’,” he exclaimed.
</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“I don’t,” she answered, “but they were so little, and
the grass was so thick and strong, and they looked as if they had no room to
breathe. So I made a place for them. I don’t even know what they
are.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“我不知道,”她回答，“但是它们那么小，草又那么粗壮，它们看起来好像没有呼吸的空间。所以我给他们留了个位置。我甚至不知道它们是什么。”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source">
Dickon went and knelt down by them, smiling his wide smile.
</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“Tha’ was right,” he said. “A gardener couldn’t
have told thee better. They’ll grow now like Jack’s bean-stalk.
They’re crocuses an’ snowdrops, an’ these here is
narcissuses,” turning to another patch, “an here’s
daffydowndillys. Eh! they will be a sight.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“你是对的,”他说。”一个园丁不可能告诉你更好的了。它们会像杰克的豆茎一样生长。它们是番红花和雪花莲，这里是水仙,”转向另一块地，“这里是水仙花。呃！它们将成为一道风景。”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source">
He ran from one clearing to another.
</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source">
“Tha’ has done a lot o’ work for such a little wench,”
he said, looking her over.
</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“I’m growing fatter,” said Mary, “and I’m growing
stronger. I used always to be tired. When I dig I’m not tired at all. I
like to smell the earth when it’s turned up.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“我越来越胖了,”玛丽说，“我越来越强壮了。我以前总是很累。当我挖的时候，我一点也不累。我喜欢闻到泥土的味道。”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“It’s rare good for thee,” he said, nodding his head wisely.
“There’s naught as nice as th’ smell o’ good clean
earth, except th’ smell o’ fresh growin’ things when
th’ rain falls on ’em. I get out on th’ moor many a day when
it’s rainin’ an’ I lie under a bush an’ listen to
th’ soft swish o’ drops on th’ heather an’ I just sniff
an’ sniff. My nose end fair quivers like a rabbit’s, mother
says.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“这对你来说是难得的好事,”他说，明智地点了点头。“没有什么比这种清新的泥土气味更好闻的了，除了雨点落在新鲜的植物上的气味。每当下雨的时候，我都会去荒原上，躺在灌木丛下，听着石南花上轻柔的水滴声，我只是闻闻。我的鼻子末端像兔子一样颤抖，妈妈说</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source">
“Do you never catch cold?” inquired Mary, gazing at him
wonderingly. She had never seen such a funny boy, or such a nice one.
</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“Not me,” he said, grinning. “I never ketched cold since I
was born. I wasn’t brought up nesh enough. I’ve chased about
th’ moor in all weathers same as th’ rabbits does. Mother says
I’ve sniffed up too much fresh air for twelve year’ to ever get to
sniffin’ with cold. I’m as tough as a white-thorn knobstick.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“不是我,”他笑着说。“自从我出生，我从未感冒过。我还不够成熟。我像兔子一样，在荒原上到处追逐。妈妈说我已经吸了十二年的新鲜空气，没有机会在寒冷的天气里闻东西了。我就像白刺一样坚强”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source">
He was working all the time he was talking and Mary was following him and
helping him with her fork or the trowel.
</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source">
“There’s a lot of work to do here!” he said once, looking
about quite exultantly.
</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source">
“Will you come again and help me to do it?” Mary begged.
“I’m sure I can help, too. I can dig and pull up weeds, and do
whatever you tell me. Oh! do come, Dickon!”
</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source">
“I’ll come every day if tha’ wants me, rain or shine,”
he answered stoutly. “It’s the best fun I ever had in my
life—shut in here an’ wakenin’ up a garden.”
</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source">
“If you will come,” said Mary, “if you will help me to make
it alive I’ll—I don’t know what I’ll do,” she
ended helplessly. What could you do for a boy like that?
</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source">
“I’ll tell thee what tha’ll do,” said Dickon, with his
happy grin. “Tha’ll get fat an’ tha’ll get as hungry as
a young fox an’ tha’ll learn how to talk to th’ robin same as
I do. Eh! we’ll have a lot o’ fun.”
</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source">
He began to walk about, looking up in the trees and at the walls and bushes
with a thoughtful expression.
</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“I wouldn’t want to make it look like a gardener’s garden,
all clipped an’ spick an’ span, would you?” he said.
“It’s nicer like this with things runnin’ wild, an’
swingin’ an’ catchin’ hold of each other.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“我可不想让它看起来像一个园丁的花园，修剪得干干净净，你说呢?”他说。“这样更好，东西跑得很疯狂，互相摇摆，抓住对方。”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source">
“Don’t let us make it tidy,” said Mary anxiously. “It
wouldn’t seem like a secret garden if it was tidy.”
</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source">
Dickon stood rubbing his rusty-red head with a rather puzzled look.
</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source">
“It’s a secret garden sure enough,” he said, “but seems
like someone besides th’ robin must have been in it since it was shut up
ten year’ ago.”
</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source">
“But the door was locked and the key was buried,” said Mary.
“No one could get in.”
</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source">
“That’s true,” he answered. “It’s a queer place.
Seems to me as if there’d been a bit o’ prunin’ done here
an’ there, later than ten year’ ago.”
</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source">
“But how could it have been done?” said Mary.
</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source">
He was examining a branch of a standard rose and he shook his head.
</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source">
“Aye! how could it!” he murmured. “With th’ door locked
an’ th’ key buried.”
</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
Mistress Mary always felt that however many years she lived she should never
forget that first morning when her garden began to grow. Of course, it did seem
to begin to grow for her that morning. When Dickon began to clear places to
plant seeds, she remembered what Basil had sung at her when he wanted to tease
her.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">玛丽小姐总是觉得无论她活了多少年，她都不应该忘记她的花园开始生长的第一个早晨。当然，那天早上她的确开始长了。当迪肯开始清理种子的地方时，她想起了巴兹尔想逗她时对她唱的歌。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source">
“Are there any flowers that look like bells?” she inquired.
</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source">
“Lilies o’ th’ valley does,” he answered, digging away
with the trowel, “an’ there’s Canterbury bells, an’
campanulas.”
</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“Let’s plant some,” said Mary.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“让我们种一些吧,”玛丽说。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“There’s lilies o’ th, valley here already; I saw ’em.
They’ll have growed too close an’ we’ll have to separate
’em, but there’s plenty. Th’ other ones takes two years to
bloom from seed, but I can bring you some bits o’ plants from our cottage
garden. Why does tha’ want ’em?”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“这里已经有百合了，山谷里已经有了，我看见它们了。它们长得太近了，我们得把它们分开，但是还有很多。其他的花需要两年的时间才能开花，但我可以从我们的农舍花园里给你带一些植物来。你为什么想要它们?”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source">
Then Mary told him about Basil and his brothers and sisters in India and of how
she had hated them and of their calling her “Mistress Mary Quite
Contrary.”
</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source">
“They used to dance round and sing at me. They sang—
</p>

<p class="poem cyxy-trs-source">
‘Mistress Mary, quite contrary,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How does your garden grow?<br>
With silver bells, and cockle shells,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And marigolds all in a row.’<br>
</p>

<p class="noindent cyxy-trs-source">
I just remembered it and it made me wonder if there were really flowers like
silver bells.”
</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source">
She frowned a little and gave her trowel a rather spiteful dig into the earth.
</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“I wasn’t as contrary as they were.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“我不像他们那样反对。”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
But Dickon laughed.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">但迪肯笑了。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“Eh!” he said, and as he crumbled the rich black soil she saw he
was sniffing up the scent of it. “There doesn’t seem to be no need
for no one to be contrary when there’s flowers an’ such like,
an’ such lots o’ friendly wild things runnin’ about
makin’ homes for themselves, or buildin’ nests an’
singin’ an’ whistlin’, does there?”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“呃!”他说，当他把肥沃的黑土碾碎的时候，她看到他正在嗅着土壤的气味。“有花之类的，有这么多友好的野生动物在为自己建造房屋，或者筑巢、唱歌、吹口哨，似乎没有必要大家都反对，不是吗?”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
Mary, kneeling by him holding the seeds, looked at him and stopped frowning.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">玛丽抱着种子跪在他身边，看着他，不再皱眉。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“Dickon,” she said, “you are as nice as Martha said you were.
I like you, and you make the fifth person. I never thought I should like five
people.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“迪肯,”她说，“你和玛莎说的一样好。我喜欢你，你是第五个。我从没想过我会喜欢五个人。”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source">
Dickon sat up on his heels as Martha did when she was polishing the grate. He
did look funny and delightful, Mary thought, with his round blue eyes and red
cheeks and happy looking turned-up nose.
</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“Only five folk as tha’ likes?” he said. “Who is
th’ other four?”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“只有你喜欢的五个人?”他说。“另外四个是谁?”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“Your mother and Martha,” Mary checked them off on her fingers,
“and the robin and Ben Weatherstaff.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“你母亲和玛莎,”玛丽用手指勾了勾，“还有知更鸟和本 · 韦瑟斯塔夫。”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
Dickon laughed so that he was obliged to stifle the sound by putting his arm
over his mouth.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">狄肯大笑起来，不得不用胳膊捂住嘴，把声音压下去。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“I know tha’ thinks I’m a queer lad,” he said,
“but I think tha’ art th’ queerest little lass I ever
saw.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“我知道你认为我是一个奇怪的小伙子,”他说，“但是我认为你是我见过的最奇怪的小姑娘。”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source">
Then Mary did a strange thing. She leaned forward and asked him a question she
had never dreamed of asking anyone before. And she tried to ask it in
Yorkshire because that was his language, and in India a native was always
pleased if you knew his speech.
</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“Does tha’ like me?” she said.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“你喜欢我吗?”她说。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“Eh!” he answered heartily, “that I does. I likes thee
wonderful, an’ so does th’ robin, I do believe!”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“啊!”他热情地回答，“我确实喜欢你。我非常喜欢你，我相信知更鸟也喜欢你!”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“That’s two, then,” said Mary. “That’s two for
me.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“那就是两个了,”玛丽说，“这是我的两个。”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
And then they began to work harder than ever and more joyfully. Mary was
startled and sorry when she heard the big clock in the courtyard strike the
hour of her midday dinner.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">然后，他们开始比以往更加努力，更加快乐地工作。当玛丽听到院子里的大钟敲响她正午吃饭的时间时，她又惊又难过。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“I shall have to go,” she said mournfully. “And you will have
to go too, won’t you?”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“我得走了,”她悲伤地说，“你也得走了，是吗?”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
Dickon grinned.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">迪肯咧嘴一笑。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source">
“My dinner’s easy to carry about with me,” he said.
“Mother always lets me put a bit o’ somethin’ in my
pocket.”
</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
He picked up his coat from the grass and brought out of a pocket a lumpy little
bundle tied up in a quite clean, coarse, blue and white handkerchief. It held
two thick pieces of bread with a slice of something laid between them.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">他从草地上捡起外套，从口袋里掏出一个结结实实的小包裹，用一块相当干净、粗糙、蓝白相间的手帕绑着。它夹着两片厚面包，中间夹着一片什么东西。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source">
“It’s oftenest naught but bread,” he said, “but
I’ve got a fine slice o’ fat bacon with it today.”
</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source">
Mary thought it looked a queer dinner, but he seemed ready to enjoy it.
</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source">
“Run on an’ get thy victuals,” he said. “I’ll be
done with mine first. I’ll get some more work done before I start back
home.”
</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source">
He sat down with his back against a tree.
</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source">
“I’ll call th’ robin up,” he said, “and give him
th’ rind o’ th’ bacon to peck at. They likes a bit o’
fat wonderful.”
</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
Mary could scarcely bear to leave him. Suddenly it seemed as if he might be a
sort of wood fairy who might be gone when she came into the garden again. He
seemed too good to be true. She went slowly half-way to the door in the wall
and then she stopped and went back.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">玛丽几乎不能忍受离开他。突然间，他好像变成了一个木头仙女，当她再次来到花园时，她可能已经不在了。他看起来好得不真实。她慢慢地走到墙上那扇门的中间，然后停下来又走回去。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source">
“Whatever happens, you—you never would tell?” she said.
</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source">
His poppy-colored cheeks were distended with his first big bite of bread and
bacon, but he managed to smile encouragingly.
</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“If tha’ was a missel thrush an’ showed me where thy nest
was, does tha’ think I’d tell anyone? Not me,” he said.
“Tha’ art as safe as a missel thrush.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“如果你是一只丢失的画眉，告诉我你的巢在哪里，你认为我会告诉别人吗？不是我,”他说。“你安全得就像一只画眉”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source">
And she was quite sure she was.

Mary ran so fast that she was rather out of breath when she reached her room.
Her hair was ruffled on her forehead and her cheeks were bright pink. Her
dinner was waiting on the table, and Martha was waiting near it.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">玛丽跑得如此之快，以至于当她到达她的房间时已经上气不接下气了。她的头发在前额上乱蓬蓬的，脸颊是鲜艳的粉红色。她的晚餐已经准备好了，玛莎正在桌子旁边等着。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source">
“Tha’s a bit late,” she said. “Where has tha’
been?”
</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“I’ve seen Dickon!” said Mary. “I’ve seen
Dickon!”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“我看见迪肯了!”玛丽说，“我看见迪肯了!”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“I knew he’d come,” said Martha exultantly. “How does
tha’ like him?”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“我就知道他会来的,”玛莎兴高采烈地说，“你觉得他怎么样?”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“I think—I think he’s beautiful!” said Mary in a
determined voice.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“我觉得——我觉得他很漂亮!”玛丽用坚定的声音说。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
Martha looked rather taken aback but she looked pleased, too.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">玛莎看起来很吃惊，但她看起来也很高兴。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“Well,” she said, “he’s th’ best lad as ever was
born, but us never thought he was handsome. His nose turns up too much.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“嗯,”她说，“他是有史以来最好的小伙子，但我们从来没有认为他很英俊。他的鼻子太翘了。”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“I like it to turn up,” said Mary.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“我喜欢它出现,”玛丽说。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“An’ his eyes is so round,” said Martha, a trifle doubtful.
“Though they’re a nice color.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“他的眼睛很圆,”玛莎有点怀疑地说，“虽然颜色很好看。”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“I like them round,” said Mary. “And they are exactly the
color of the sky over the moor.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“我喜欢它们圆圆的,”玛丽说，“它们的颜色和荒野上的天空一模一样。”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
Martha beamed with satisfaction.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">玛莎满意地笑了。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“Mother says he made ’em that color with always lookin’ up at
th’ birds an’ th’ clouds. But he has got a big mouth,
hasn’t he, now?”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“妈妈说是他做的，他总是抬头看着鸟儿和云彩”。但他现在是个大嘴巴，不是吗?”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“I love his big mouth,” said Mary obstinately. “I wish mine
were just like it.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“我喜欢他的大嘴巴,”玛丽固执地说，“我希望我的也是这样。”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
Martha chuckled delightedly.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">玛莎高兴地笑了。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“It’d look rare an’ funny in thy bit of a face,” she
said. “But I knowed it would be that way when tha’ saw him. How did
tha’ like th’ seeds an’ th’ garden tools?”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“在你这张脸上看起来很罕见而且有趣,”她说。“但是当你看到他的时候，我就知道事情会变成这样”。你喜欢这些种子和园艺工具吗?”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source">
“How did you know he brought them?” asked Mary.
</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source">
“Eh! I never thought of him not bringin’ ’em. He’d be
sure to bring ’em if they was in Yorkshire. He’s such a trusty
lad.”
</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
Mary was afraid that she might begin to ask difficult questions, but she did
not. She was very much interested in the seeds and gardening tools, and there
was only one moment when Mary was frightened. This was when she began to ask
where the flowers were to be planted.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">玛丽担心她可能会开始问一些难以回答的问题，但她没有这样做。她对种子和园艺工具非常感兴趣，玛丽只有一次感到害怕。这时她开始问花要种在哪里。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source">
“Who did tha’ ask about it?” she inquired.
</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source">
“I haven’t asked anybody yet,” said Mary, hesitating.
</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source">
“Well, I wouldn’t ask th’ head gardener. He’s too
grand, Mr. Roach is.”
</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source">
“I’ve never seen him,” said Mary. “I’ve only seen
undergardeners and Ben Weatherstaff.”
</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“If I was you, I’d ask Ben Weatherstaff,” advised Martha.
“He’s not half as bad as he looks, for all he’s so crabbed.
Mr. Craven lets him do what he likes because he was here when Mrs. Craven was
alive, an’ he used to make her laugh. She liked him. Perhaps he’d
find you a corner somewhere out o’ the way.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“如果我是你，我会问问本 · 韦瑟斯塔夫,”玛莎建议道。“他没有看上去一半那么坏，尽管他脾气暴躁。克雷文先生让他做他喜欢做的事情，因为克雷文夫人活着的时候他就在这里，他过去常常逗她笑。她喜欢他。也许他会给你找个偏僻的角落</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source">
“If it was out of the way and no one wanted it, no one <i>could</i> mind
my having it, could they?” Mary said anxiously.
</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source">
“There wouldn’t be no reason,” answered Martha. “You
wouldn’t do no harm.”
</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
Mary ate her dinner as quickly as she could and when she rose from the table
she was going to run to her room to put on her hat again, but Martha stopped
her.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">玛丽尽可能快地吃完了晚饭，当她从桌子上站起来的时候，她正要跑回房间重新戴上她的帽子，但是玛莎阻止了她。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“I’ve got somethin’ to tell you,” she said. “I
thought I’d let you eat your dinner first. Mr. Craven came back this
mornin’ and I think he wants to see you.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“我有事要告诉你,”她说。我想先让你吃晚饭。克雷文先生今早回来了，我想他想见你</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
Mary turned quite pale.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">玛丽脸色苍白。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source">
“Oh!” she said. “Why! Why! He didn’t want to see me
when I came. I heard Pitcher say he didn’t.”
</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source">
“Well,” explained Martha, “Mrs. Medlock says it’s
because o’ mother. She was walkin’ to Thwaite village an’ she
met him. She’d never spoke to him before, but Mrs. Craven had been to our
cottage two or three times. He’d forgot, but mother hadn’t
an’ she made bold to stop him. I don’t know what she said to him
about you but she said somethin’ as put him in th’ mind to see you
before he goes away again, tomorrow.”
</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source">
“Oh!” cried Mary, “is he going away tomorrow? I am so
glad!”
</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source">
“He’s goin’ for a long time. He mayn’t come back till
autumn or winter. He’s goin’ to travel in foreign places.
He’s always doin’ it.”
</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source">
“Oh! I’m so glad—so glad!” said Mary thankfully.
</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source">
If he did not come back until winter, or even autumn, there would be time to
watch the secret garden come alive. Even if he found out then and took it away
from her she would have had that much at least.
</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source">
“When do you think he will want to see—”
</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
She did not finish the sentence, because the door opened, and Mrs. Medlock
walked in. She had on her best black dress and cap, and her collar was fastened
with a large brooch with a picture of a man’s face on it. It was a
colored photograph of Mr. Medlock who had died years ago, and she always wore
it when she was dressed up. She looked nervous and excited.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">她没有把话说完，因为门开了，梅德洛克太太走了进来。她穿着最好的黑色连衣裙，戴着最好的帽子，衣领上别着一个大胸针，上面有一张男人的脸。那是一张彩色照片，是几年前去世的梅德洛克先生的，她穿衣服的时候总是戴着它。她看上去既紧张又兴奋。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“Your hair’s rough,” she said quickly. “Go and brush
it. Martha, help her to slip on her best dress. Mr. Craven sent me to bring her
to him in his study.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“你的头发很粗糙,”她很快地说。“去刷刷它。玛莎，帮她穿上她最好的衣服。克雷文先生让我带她去他书房</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
All the pink left Mary’s cheeks. Her heart began to thump and she felt
herself changing into a stiff, plain, silent child again. She did not even
answer Mrs. Medlock, but turned and walked into her bedroom, followed by
Martha. She said nothing while her dress was changed, and her hair brushed, and
after she was quite tidy she followed Mrs. Medlock down the corridors, in
silence. What was there for her to say? She was obliged to go and see Mr.
Craven and he would not like her, and she would not like him. She knew what he
would think of her.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">所有的粉红色都从玛丽的脸颊上消失了。她的心开始怦怦直跳，她觉得自己又变成了一个呆板、平凡、沉默的孩子。她甚至没有回答梅德洛克太太的问题，而是转身走进她的卧室，玛莎跟在后面。她换了衣服，梳了头发，什么也没说。她收拾干净后，跟着梅德洛克太太走过走廊，一言不发。她到底想说什么？她不得不去见克雷文先生，他不会喜欢她，她也不会喜欢他。她知道他会怎么看她。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
She was taken to a part of the house she had not been into before. At last Mrs.
Medlock knocked at a door, and when someone said, “Come in,” they
entered the room together. A man was sitting in an armchair before the fire,
and Mrs. Medlock spoke to him.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">她被带到一个她以前从未去过的地方。最后，梅德洛克太太敲了敲门，当有人说“请进”时，他们一起走进了房间。一个男人坐在火炉前的扶手椅上，梅德洛克太太对他说话。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source">
“This is Miss Mary, sir,” she said.
</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source">
“You can go and leave her here. I will ring for you when I want you to
take her away,” said Mr. Craven.
</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
When she went out and closed the door, Mary could only stand waiting, a plain
little thing, twisting her thin hands together. She could see that the man in
the chair was not so much a hunchback as a man with high, rather crooked
shoulders, and he had black hair streaked with white. He turned his head over
his high shoulders and spoke to her.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">当她出去关上门的时候，玛丽只能站在那里等着，一个普通的小东西，扭动着她那纤细的双手。她看得出来，那个坐在椅子上的男人并不是驼背，而是一个肩膀很高，相当弯曲的男人，他的头发是黑白相间的。他把头转过高高的肩膀，对她说话。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“Come here!” he said.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“过来!”他说。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
Mary went to him.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">玛丽去找他了。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
He was not ugly. His face would have been handsome if it had not been so
miserable. He looked as if the sight of her worried and fretted him and as if
he did not know what in the world to do with her.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">他不丑。如果他的脸没有那么惨的话，他的脸本来会很英俊的。他看上去好像看到她就忧心忡忡，烦躁不安，好像不知道该拿她怎么办。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“Are you well?” he asked.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“你还好吗?”他问。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“Yes,” answered Mary.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“是的,”玛丽回答。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source">
“Do they take good care of you?”
</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“Yes.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“是的。”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source">
He rubbed his forehead fretfully as he looked her over.
</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“You are very thin,” he said.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“你很瘦,”他说。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source">
“I am getting fatter,” Mary answered in what she knew was her
stiffest way.
</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
What an unhappy face he had! His black eyes seemed as if they scarcely saw her,
as if they were seeing something else, and he could hardly keep his thoughts
upon her.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">他的脸色多么难看啊！他的黑眼睛好像几乎没有看到她，好像看到了别的什么东西，他几乎无法把他的思想集中在她身上。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source">
“I forgot you,” he said. “How could I remember you? I
intended to send you a governess or a nurse, or someone of that sort, but I
forgot.”
</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source">
“Please,” began Mary. “Please—” and then the lump
in her throat choked her.
</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“What do you want to say?” he inquired.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“你想说什么?”他问。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“I am—I am too big for a nurse,” said Mary. “And
please—please don’t make me have a governess yet.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“是的，我太大了，不适合当护士,”玛丽说，“还有，拜托，拜托别让我请家庭教师。”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
He rubbed his forehead again and stared at her.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">他又揉了揉额头，盯着她看。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“That was what the Sowerby woman said,” he muttered absent-mindedly.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“索尔比家的女人就是这么说的,”他心不在焉地喃喃自语。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
Then Mary gathered a scrap of courage.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">然后玛丽鼓起了一点勇气。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“Is she—is she Martha’s mother?” she stammered.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“她——她是玛莎的母亲吗?”她结结巴巴地问。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“Yes, I think so,” he replied.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“是的，我想是的,”他回答说。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“She knows about children,” said Mary. “She has twelve. She
knows.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“她知道孩子的事,”玛丽说，“她有十二个孩子，她知道。”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
He seemed to rouse himself.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">他似乎醒了过来。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“What do you want to do?”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“你想做什么?”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“I want to play out of doors,” Mary answered, hoping that her voice
did not tremble. “I never liked it in India. It makes me hungry here, and
I am getting fatter.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“我想在户外玩,”玛丽回答，希望她的声音不要颤抖。“我一直不喜欢印度。这里让我感到饥饿，而且我越来越胖了。”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
He was watching her.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">他在监视她。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“Mrs. Sowerby said it would do you good. Perhaps it will,” he said.
“She thought you had better get stronger before you had a
governess.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">索尔比太太说这对你有好处。也许会的,”他表示。“她觉得你最好在找家庭教师之前变得更强壮”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“It makes me feel strong when I play and the wind comes over the
moor,” argued Mary.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“当我玩耍的时候，风吹过沼地的时候，它让我感觉很强壮,”玛丽争辩道。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“Where do you play?” he asked next.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“你在哪儿玩?”他接着问。</p>

“Everywhere,” gasped Mary. “Martha’s mother sent me a

beginning to stick up out of the earth. I don’t do any harm.”

you may. I am your guardian, though I am a poor one for any child. I cannot
give you time or attention. I am too ill, and wretched and distracted; but I
wish you to be happy and comfortable. I don’t know anything about
children, but Mrs. Medlock is to see that you have all you need. I sent for you

“She ought to,” said Mr. Craven. “I thought her rather bold
to stop me on the moor, but she said—Mrs. Craven had been kind to

“She is a respectable woman. Now I have seen you I think she said
sensible things. Play out of doors as much as you like. It’s a big place

“I didn’t know about them in India,” said Mary. “I was

“A bit of earth,” he said to himself, and Mary thought that somehow
she must have reminded him of something. When he stopped and spoke to her his
dark eyes looked almost soft and kind.
</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source">
“You can have as much earth as you want,” he said. “You
remind me of someone else who loved the earth and things that grow. When you
see a bit of earth you want,” with something like a smile, “take
it, child, and make it come alive.”

“May I take it from anywhere—if it’s not wanted?”
</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source">
“Anywhere,” he answered. “There! You must go now, I am
tired.” He touched the bell to call Mrs. Medlock. “Good-by. I shall
be away all summer.”
</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source">
Mrs. Medlock came so quickly that Mary thought she must have been waiting in
the corridor.
</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source">
“Mrs. Medlock,” Mr. Craven said to her, “now I have seen the
child I understand what Mrs. Sowerby meant. She must be less delicate before
she begins lessons. Give her simple, healthy food. Let her run wild in the
garden. Don’t look after her too much. She needs liberty and fresh air
and romping about. Mrs. Sowerby is to come and see her now and then and she may
sometimes go to the cottage.”
</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
Mrs. Medlock looked pleased. She was relieved to hear that she need not
“look after” Mary too much. She had felt her a tiresome charge and
had indeed seen as little of her as she dared. In addition to this she was fond
of Martha’s mother.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">梅德洛克夫人看起来很高兴。听到她不必过多地“照顾”玛丽，她松了一口气。她觉得她是一个令人厌烦的负担，而且她确实尽可能少见到她。除此之外，她还喜欢玛莎的母亲。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“Thank you, sir,” she said. “Susan Sowerby and me went to
school together and she’s as sensible and good-hearted a woman as
you’d find in a day’s walk. I never had any children myself and
she’s had twelve, and there never was healthier or better ones. Miss Mary
can get no harm from them. I’d always take Susan Sowerby’s advice
about children myself. She’s what you might call healthy-minded—if
you understand me.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“谢谢你，先生,”她说。“苏珊 · 索尔比和我一起上的学，她是一个通情达理、心地善良的女人，就像你在一天的散步中看到的那样。我自己从来没有孩子，她有12个，从来没有更健康或更好的。玛丽小姐不会受到他们的伤害。我自己也总是听从苏珊 · 索尔比关于孩子的建议。如果你理解我的话，她就是你所说的健康的人。”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source">
“I understand,” Mr. Craven answered. “Take Miss Mary away now
and send Pitcher to me.”
</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source">
When Mrs. Medlock left her at the end of her own corridor Mary flew back to her
room. She found Martha waiting there. Martha had, in fact, hurried back after
she had removed the dinner service.
</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source">
“I can have my garden!” cried Mary. “I may have it where I
like! I am not going to have a governess for a long time! Your mother is coming
to see me and I may go to your cottage! He says a little girl like me could not
do any harm and I may do what I like—anywhere!”
</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source">
“Eh!” said Martha delightedly, “that was nice of him
wasn’t it?”
</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source">
“Martha,” said Mary solemnly, “he is really a nice man, only
his face is so miserable and his forehead is all drawn together.”

She ran as quickly as she could to the garden. She had been away so much longer
than she had thought she should and she knew Dickon would have to set out early
on his five-mile walk. When she slipped through the door under the ivy, she saw
he was not working where she had left him. The gardening tools were laid
together under a tree. She ran to them, looking all round the place, but there
was no Dickon to be seen. He had gone away and the secret garden was
empty—except for the robin who had just flown across the wall and sat on
a standard rose-bush watching her.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">她以最快的速度跑向花园。她离开的时间比她想象的要长得多，她知道迪肯必须早点出发走五英里的路。当她从常春藤下面的门溜进来时，她看到他已经不在她离开他的地方工作了。园艺工具被放在一棵树下。她跑向他们，四处张望，但是没有看到迪肯。他已经走了，秘密花园里空无一人ーー只有一只知更鸟刚刚飞过墙，坐在一株标准的玫瑰花丛上看着她。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source">
“He’s gone,” she said woefully. “Oh! was he—was
he—was he only a wood fairy?”
</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
Something white fastened to the standard rose-bush caught her eye. It was a
piece of paper, in fact, it was a piece of the letter she had printed for
Martha to send to Dickon. It was fastened on the bush with a long thorn, and in
a minute she knew Dickon had left it there. There were some roughly printed
letters on it and a sort of picture. At first she could not tell what it was.
Then she saw it was meant for a nest with a bird sitting on it. Underneath were
the printed letters and they said:

Mary took the picture back to the house when she went to her supper and she
showed it to Martha.
</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“Eh!” said Martha with great pride. “I never knew our Dickon
was as clever as that. That there’s a picture of a missel thrush on her
nest, as large as life an’ twice as natural.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“呃!”玛莎骄傲地说。“我从来不知道我们的狄肯这么聪明。有一张画，画的是一只雀鸟在它的巢上，有生命那么大，有自然的两倍。”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
Then Mary knew Dickon had meant the picture to be a message. He had meant that
she might be sure he would keep her secret. Her garden was her nest and she was
like a missel thrush. Oh, how she did like that queer, common boy!
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">然后玛丽知道迪肯想让这幅画传达一个信息。他的意思是她可能确信他会保守她的秘密。她的花园就是她的巢，她就像一只雀鸟。哦，她多么喜欢那个同性恋，普通的男孩！</p>

She hoped he would come back the very next day and she fell asleep looking
forward to the morning.
</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
But you never know what the weather will do in Yorkshire, particularly in the
springtime. She was awakened in the night by the sound of rain beating with
heavy drops against her window. It was pouring down in torrents and the wind
was “wuthering” round the corners and in the chimneys of the huge
old house. Mary sat up in bed and felt miserable and angry.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">但你永远不知道约克郡的天气会怎样，尤其是在春天。夜里，她被雨滴打在窗户上的声音吵醒了。倾盆大雨倾泻而下，狂风在巨大的老房子的拐角处和烟囱里“呼啸”着。玛丽从床上坐起来，感到痛苦和愤怒。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source">
“The rain is as contrary as I ever was,” she said. “It came
because it knew I did not want it.”
</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
She threw herself back on her pillow and buried her face. She did not cry, but
she lay and hated the sound of the heavily beating rain, she hated the wind and
its “wuthering.” She could not go to sleep again. The mournful
sound kept her awake because she felt mournful herself. If she had felt happy
it would probably have lulled her to sleep. How it “wuthered” and
how the big raindrops poured down and beat against the pane!
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">她躺回枕头上，把脸埋进去。她没有哭，但是她躺在那里，她讨厌大雨的声音，她讨厌风和它的“呼啸”她再也睡不着了。悲伤的声音使她保持清醒，因为她自己也感到悲伤。如果她感到高兴，那可能会使她昏昏欲睡。它是如何“呼啸”的，大雨是如何倾泻而下，打在玻璃上的！</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source">
“It sounds just like a person lost on the moor and wandering on and on
crying,” she said.<br><br>
</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
She had been lying awake turning from side to side for about an hour, when
suddenly something made her sit up in bed and turn her head toward the door
listening. She listened and she listened.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">她已经醒着躺在床上左右转了大约一个小时，突然有什么东西让她坐起来，转头朝门口倾听。她听了又听。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source">
“It isn’t the wind now,” she said in a loud whisper.
“That isn’t the wind. It is different. It is that crying I heard
before.”
</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
The door of her room was ajar and the sound came down the corridor, a far-off
faint sound of fretful crying. She listened for a few minutes and each minute
she became more and more sure. She felt as if she must find out what it was. It
seemed even stranger than the secret garden and the buried key. Perhaps the
fact that she was in a rebellious mood made her bold. She put her foot out of
bed and stood on the floor.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">她房间的门半开着，声音从走廊里传来，远处隐约传来焦躁的哭声。她听了几分钟，每一分钟她都变得越来越肯定。她觉得她必须弄清楚那是什么。这似乎比秘密花园和被埋藏的钥匙还要奇怪。也许她的叛逆情绪使她变得大胆。她把脚从床上放下来，站在地板上。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source">
“I am going to find out what it is,” she said. “Everybody is
in bed and I don’t care about Mrs. Medlock—I don’t
care!”
</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
There was a candle by her bedside and she took it up and went softly out of the
room. The corridor looked very long and dark, but she was too excited to mind
that. She thought she remembered the corners she must turn to find the short
corridor with the door covered with tapestry—the one Mrs. Medlock had
come through the day she lost herself. The sound had come up that passage. So
she went on with her dim light, almost feeling her way, her heart beating so
loud that she fancied she could hear it. The far-off faint crying went on and
led her. Sometimes it stopped for a moment or so and then began again. Was this
the right corner to turn? She stopped and thought. Yes it was. Down this
passage and then to the left, and then up two broad steps, and then to the
right again. Yes, there was the tapestry door.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">她的床边有一支蜡烛，她拿起蜡烛，轻轻地走出了房间。走廊看起来又长又黑，但是她太兴奋了，没有注意到这一点。她想起了必须拐弯才能找到那条门上挂着挂毯的短走廊——梅德洛克太太迷路那天走过的那条。声音从那条通道传来。于是她带着微弱的灯光继续走着，几乎是在摸索着前进的道路，她的心跳得如此之快，以至于她以为自己能听见。远处隐隐约约的哭声继续着，引导着她。有时它会停止一会儿，然后再开始。这是正确的转角吗？她停下来想了想。是的。沿着这条通道一直走，然后向左走，然后上两个宽阔的台阶，然后再向右走。是的，有挂毯门。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
She pushed it open very gently and closed it behind her, and she stood in the
corridor and could hear the crying quite plainly, though it was not loud. It
was on the other side of the wall at her left and a few yards farther on there
was a door. She could see a glimmer of light coming from beneath it. The
Someone was crying in that room, and it was quite a young Someone.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">她轻轻地把门推开，在身后合上，她站在走廊里，能听到哭声，虽然声音不大。它在墙的另一边，在她的左边，再往前几码有一扇门。她可以看到从下面发出的一丝光亮。“某人”在那个房间里哭泣，而且是一个相当年轻的“某人”。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source">
So she walked to the door and pushed it open, and there she was standing in the
room!
</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
It was a big room with ancient, handsome furniture in it. There was a low fire
glowing faintly on the hearth and a night light burning by the side of a carved
four-posted bed hung with brocade, and on the bed was lying a boy, crying
fretfully.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">这是一个大房间，里面摆放着古老而漂亮的家具。壁炉上有一团微弱的火光，床边有一盏夜灯在燃烧，床上有四根柱子，上面挂着锦缎，床上躺着一个男孩，他在焦急地哭泣。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source">
Mary wondered if she was in a real place or if she had fallen asleep again and
was dreaming without knowing it.
</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
The boy had a sharp, delicate face the color of ivory and he seemed to have
eyes too big for it. He had also a lot of hair which tumbled over his forehead
in heavy locks and made his thin face seem smaller. He looked like a boy who
had been ill, but he was crying more as if he were tired and cross than as if
he were in pain.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">这个男孩有一张象牙色的尖尖的、精致的脸，他的眼睛似乎太大了。他还有许多头发，密密麻麻地披在前额上，使他瘦削的脸看起来更小了。他看起来像是一个生病的男孩，但是他哭得更多，好像他很累，很生气，而不是像他很痛苦。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
Mary stood near the door with her candle in her hand, holding her breath. Then
she crept across the room, and, as she drew nearer, the light attracted the
boy’s attention and he turned his head on his pillow and stared at her,
his gray eyes opening so wide that they seemed immense.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">玛丽站在门边，手里拿着蜡烛，屏住呼吸。然后她蹑手蹑脚地穿过房间，当她走近时，光线吸引了男孩的注意力，他把头转到枕头上盯着她，灰色的眼睛睁得如此大，看起来很大。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source">
“Who are you?” he said at last in a half-frightened whisper.
“Are you a ghost?”
</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source">
“No, I am not,” Mary answered, her own whisper sounding half
frightened. “Are you one?”
</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
He stared and stared and stared. Mary could not help noticing what strange eyes
he had. They were agate gray and they looked too big for his face because they
had black lashes all round them.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">他凝视着，凝视着，凝视着。玛丽不禁注意到他的眼睛多么奇怪。它们是玛瑙灰色的，对他的脸来说看起来太大了，因为它们周围都是黑色的睫毛。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source">
“No,” he replied after waiting a moment or so. “I am
Colin.”

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“Who is Colin?” she faltered.

“Come here,” he said, still keeping his strange eyes fixed on her
with an anxious expression.

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
She came close to the bed and he put out his hand and touched her.

“Because I am like this always, ill and having to lie down. My father
won’t let people talk me over either. The servants are not allowed to
speak about me. If I live I may be a hunchback, but I shan’t live. My
father hates to think I may be like him.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“因为我总是这样，生病，不得不躺下。我父亲也不让别人说服我。仆人们不允许谈论我。如果我活着，我可能是个驼背，但我不会活着。我父亲不愿意相信我会像他一样。”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“Oh, what a queer house this is!” Mary said. “What a queer
house! Everything is a kind of secret. Rooms are locked up and gardens are
locked up—and you! Have you been locked up?”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“哦，这房子真奇怪!”玛丽说。“多么奇怪的房子！一切都是秘密。房间锁上了，花园也锁上了，还有你！你被关起来了吗?”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“No. I stay in this room because I don’t want to be moved out of
it. It tires me too much.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“不。我待在这个房间里是因为我不想被赶出去。这让我太累了。”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“Does your father come and see you?” Mary ventured.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“你父亲来看你吗?”玛丽大胆地问。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“Sometimes. Generally when I am asleep. He doesn’t want to see
me.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“有时候。通常是在我睡着的时候。他不想见我。”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“Why?” Mary could not help asking again.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“为什么?”玛丽忍不住又问了一遍。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
A sort of angry shadow passed over the boy’s face.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">一种愤怒的阴影从男孩的脸上掠过。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“My mother died when I was born and it makes him wretched to look at me.
He thinks I don’t know, but I’ve heard people talking. He almost
hates me.”

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“He hates the garden, because she died,” said Mary half speaking to
herself.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“他讨厌花园，因为她死了,”玛丽半自言自语地说。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“What garden?” the boy asked.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“什么花园?”男孩问。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“Oh! just—just a garden she used to like,” Mary stammered.
“Have you been here always?”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“哦! 只是——只是她过去喜欢的一个花园,”玛丽结结巴巴地说。“你一直都在这儿吗?”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“Nearly always. Sometimes I have been taken to places at the seaside, but
I won’t stay because people stare at me. I used to wear an iron thing to
keep my back straight, but a grand doctor came from London to see me and said
it was stupid. He told them to take it off and keep me out in the fresh air. I
hate fresh air and I don’t want to go out.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">几乎总是。有时候我会被带到海边的一些地方，但是我不会因为别人盯着我看而留下来。我过去常常穿着一件铁制的衣服来保持背部挺直，但是一位伟大的医生从伦敦来看我，说这样做很愚蠢。他让他们脱下来，让我出去呼吸新鲜空气。我讨厌新鲜空气，我不想出去。”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“I didn’t when first I came here,” said Mary. “Why do
you keep looking at me like that?”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“我刚来的时候没有,”玛丽说，“你为什么一直那样看着我?”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“Because of the dreams that are so real,” he answered rather
fretfully. “Sometimes when I open my eyes I don’t believe I’m
awake.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“因为那些梦是如此真实,”他相当烦躁地回答。“有时当我睁开眼睛，我不相信我是醒着的。”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“We’re both awake,” said Mary. She glanced round the room
with its high ceiling and shadowy corners and dim fire-light. “It looks
quite like a dream, and it’s the middle of the night, and everybody in
the house is asleep—everybody but us. We are wide awake.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“我们都醒了,”玛丽说。她环顾了一下房间，屋顶很高，角落里阴暗，火光昏暗。“这看起来很像一场梦，现在是半夜，屋子里的每个人都睡着了ーー除了我们。我们非常清醒。”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“I don’t want it to be a dream,” the boy said restlessly.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“我不希望这是一个梦,”男孩不安地说。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
Mary thought of something all at once.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">玛丽突然想到了一件事。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“If you don’t like people to see you,” she began, “do
you want me to go away?”

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
He still held the fold of her wrapper and he gave it a little pull.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">他仍然握着她的包装纸，轻轻地拉了一下。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“No,” he said. “I should be sure you were a dream if you
went. If you are real, sit down on that big footstool and talk. I want to hear
about you.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“不,”他说。“如果你去了，我肯定你是一个梦想。如果你是真的，就坐在那个大脚凳上说话。我想听听你的故事”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
Mary put down her candle on the table near the bed and sat down on the
cushioned stool. She did not want to go away at all. She wanted to stay in the
mysterious hidden-away room and talk to the mysterious boy.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">玛丽把蜡烛放在床边的桌子上，在软凳上坐了下来。她根本不想离开。她想呆在神秘的密室里，和那个神秘的男孩谈谈。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“What do you want me to tell you?” she said.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“你想让我告诉你什么?”她说。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
He wanted to know how long she had been at Misselthwaite; he wanted to know
which corridor her room was on; he wanted to know what she had been doing; if
she disliked the moor as he disliked it; where she had lived before she came to
Yorkshire. She answered all these questions and many more and he lay back on
his pillow and listened. He made her tell him a great deal about India and
about her voyage across the ocean. She found out that because he had been an
invalid he had not learned things as other children had. One of his nurses had
taught him to read when he was quite little and he was always reading and
looking at pictures in splendid books.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">他想知道她在 Misselthwaite 呆了多久，她的房间在哪条走廊上，她在做什么，她是否像他一样不喜欢这片沼地，她来约克郡之前住在哪里。她回答了所有这些问题，还有更多，他躺在枕头上听着。他让她告诉他很多关于印度的事，还有她横渡大洋的旅行。她发现因为他是个残疾人，所以他没有像其他孩子那样学到东西。他的一个护士在他很小的时候就教他读书，他总是读书，看精彩的书中的图画。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
Though his father rarely saw him when he was awake, he was given all sorts of
wonderful things to amuse himself with. He never seemed to have been amused,
however. He could have anything he asked for and was never made to do anything
he did not like to do.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">虽然他父亲很少在他醒着的时候看到他，但是他得到了各种各样好玩的东西来娱乐自己。然而，他似乎从未被逗乐过。他可以得到任何他想要的东西，从来没有人强迫他做任何他不喜欢做的事情。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“Everyone is obliged to do what pleases me,” he said indifferently.
“It makes me ill to be angry. No one believes I shall live to grow
up.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“每个人都有义务做我喜欢的事情,”他漠不关心地说。“生气让我很不舒服。没有人相信我会长大”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
He said it as if he was so accustomed to the idea that it had ceased to matter
to him at all. He seemed to like the sound of Mary’s voice. As she went
on talking he listened in a drowsy, interested way. Once or twice she wondered
if he were not gradually falling into a doze. But at last he asked a question
which opened up a new subject.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">他说得好像他已经习惯了这种想法，以至于对他来说已经没有任何意义了。他似乎喜欢玛丽的声音。当她继续说话时，他以一种昏昏欲睡的、感兴趣的方式听着。有那么一两次，她怀疑他是不是渐渐地打起了瞌睡。但最后他提出了一个问题，开辟了一个新的课题。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“How old are you?” he asked.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“你多大了?”他问。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“I am ten,” answered Mary, forgetting herself for the moment,
“and so are you.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“我十岁了,”玛丽回答，一时忘了自己的身份，“你也是。”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“How do you know that?” he demanded in a surprised voice.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“你怎么知道的?”他惊讶地问道。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source">
“Because when you were born the garden door was locked and the key was
buried. And it has been locked for ten years.”
</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source">
Colin half sat up, turning toward her, leaning on his elbows.
</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source">
“What garden door was locked? Who did it? Where was the key
buried?” he exclaimed as if he were suddenly very much interested.
</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source">
“It—it was the garden Mr. Craven hates,” said Mary nervously.
“He locked the door. No one—no one knew where he buried the
key.”
</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source">
“What sort of a garden is it?” Colin persisted eagerly.
</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source">
“No one has been allowed to go into it for ten years,” was
Mary’s careful answer.
</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
But it was too late to be careful. He was too much like herself. He too had had
nothing to think about and the idea of a hidden garden attracted him as it had
attracted her. He asked question after question. Where was it? Had she never
looked for the door? Had she never asked the gardeners?
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">但为时已晚，不能再小心了。他太像她自己了。他也没有什么可想的，隐蔽花园的想法吸引了他，就像吸引了她一样。他问了一个又一个问题。在哪找到的？她从来没有找过门吗？她从没问过园丁吗？</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source">
“They won’t talk about it,” said Mary. “I think they
have been told not to answer questions.”
</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“I would make them,” said Colin.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“我会做的,”科林说。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source">
“Could you?” Mary faltered, beginning to feel frightened. If he
could make people answer questions, who knew what might happen!
</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“Everyone is obliged to please me. I told you that,” he said.
“If I were to live, this place would sometime belong to me. They all know
that. I would make them tell me.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“每个人都有义务取悦我。我告诉过你,”他说。“如果我还活着，这个地方有时会属于我”。他们都知道。我会让他们告诉我”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
Mary had not known that she herself had been spoiled, but she could see quite
plainly that this mysterious boy had been. He thought that the whole world
belonged to him. How peculiar he was and how coolly he spoke of not living.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">玛丽并不知道她自己被宠坏了，但她可以清楚地看出这个神秘的男孩被宠坏了。他认为整个世界都属于他。他是多么的古怪，他谈到没有生活是多么的冷淡。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source">
“Do you think you won’t live?” she asked, partly because she
was curious and partly in hope of making him forget the garden.
</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“I don’t suppose I shall,” he answered as indifferently as he
had spoken before. “Ever since I remember anything I have heard people
say I shan’t. At first they thought I was too little to understand and
now they think I don’t hear. But I do. My doctor is my father’s
cousin. He is quite poor and if I die he will have all Misselthwaite when my
father is dead. I should think he wouldn’t want me to live.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“我想我不会的,”他像以前说过的那样冷淡地回答。“自从我记起任何事情，我就听到人们说我不会。一开始他们认为我太小了，不能理解现在他们认为我听不到。但我知道。我的医生是我父亲的表弟。他很穷，如果我死了，等我父亲死了，他就可以拥有所有的米瑟斯韦特了。我想他不会希望我活着。”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source">
“Do you want to live?” inquired Mary.
</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source">
“No,” he answered, in a cross, tired fashion. “But I
don’t want to die. When I feel ill I lie here and think about it until I
cry and cry.”
</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“I have heard you crying three times,” Mary said, “but I did
not know who it was. Were you crying about that?” She did so want him to
forget the garden.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“我听见你哭了三次,”玛丽说，“但我不知道是谁。你是因为这个哭了吗?”她确实想让他忘了花园的事。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source">
“I dare say,” he answered. “Let us talk about something else.
Talk about that garden. Don’t you want to see it?”
</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source">
“Yes,” answered Mary, in quite a low voice.
</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source">
“I do,” he went on persistently. “I don’t think I ever
really wanted to see anything before, but I want to see that garden. I want the
key dug up. I want the door unlocked. I would let them take me there in my
chair. That would be getting fresh air. I am going to make them open the
door.”
</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source">
He had become quite excited and his strange eyes began to shine like stars and
looked more immense than ever.
</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source">
“They have to please me,” he said. “I will make them take me
there and I will let you go, too.”
</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source">
Mary’s hands clutched each other. Everything would be
spoiled—everything! Dickon would never come back. She would never again
feel like a missel thrush with a safe-hidden nest.
</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source">
“Oh, don’t—don’t—don’t—don’t do
that!” she cried out.
</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source">
He stared as if he thought she had gone crazy!
</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source">
“Why?” he exclaimed. “You said you wanted to see it.”
</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source">
“I do,” she answered almost with a sob in her throat, “but if
you make them open the door and take you in like that it will never be a secret
again.”
</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
He leaned still farther forward.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">他身子向前倾得更远了。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source">
“A secret,” he said. “What do you mean? Tell me.”
</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source">
Mary’s words almost tumbled over one another.
</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“You see—you see,” she panted, “if no one knows but
ourselves—if there was a door, hidden somewhere under the ivy—if
there was—and we could find it; and if we could slip through it together
and shut it behind us, and no one knew anyone was inside and we called it our
garden and pretended that—that we were missel thrushes and it was our
nest, and if we played there almost every day and dug and planted seeds and
made it all come alive—”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“你看，你看,”她气喘吁吁地说，“如果只有我们自己知道，如果有一扇门，藏在常春藤下面的某个地方，如果有的话，我们就能找到它; 如果我们能一起溜进去，把它关在身后，没人知道里面有人，我们就把它叫做我们的花园，假装我们是导弹画眉，它是我们的巢，如果我们几乎每天都在那里玩耍，挖掘种子，种下种子，让它全都活过来。”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“Is it dead?” he interrupted her.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“它死了吗?”他打断了她。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source">
“It soon will be if no one cares for it,” she went on. “The
bulbs will live but the roses—”
</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source">
He stopped her again as excited as she was herself.
</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source">
“What are bulbs?” he put in quickly.
</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source">
“They are daffodils and lilies and snowdrops. They are working in the
earth now—pushing up pale green points because the spring is
coming.”
</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source">
“Is the spring coming?” he said. “What is it like? You
don’t see it in rooms if you are ill.”
</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“It is the sun shining on the rain and the rain falling on the sunshine,
and things pushing up and working under the earth,” said Mary. “If
the garden was a secret and we could get into it we could watch the things grow
bigger every day, and see how many roses are alive. Don’t you see? Oh,
don’t you see how much nicer it would be if it was a secret?”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“是阳光照在雨水上，雨水照在阳光上，还有地下的东西在向上推动和运转,”玛丽说。“如果花园是一个秘密，我们可以进入其中，我们可以看到事情越来越大，每天，看到有多少玫瑰是活着的。你还不明白吗？哦，难道你不知道如果这是个秘密，那该有多好吗?”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source">
He dropped back on his pillow and lay there with an odd expression on his face.
</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“I never had a secret,” he said, “except that one about not
living to grow up. They don’t know I know that, so it is a sort of
secret. But I like this kind better.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“我从来没有什么秘密,”他说，“除了那个关于不能活着长大的秘密。他们不知道我知道，所以这是个秘密。但我更喜欢这种。”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“If you won’t make them take you to the garden,” pleaded
Mary, “perhaps—I feel almost sure I can find out how to get in
sometime. And then—if the doctor wants you to go out in your chair, and
if you can always do what you want to do, perhaps—perhaps we might find
some boy who would push you, and we could go alone and it would always be a
secret garden.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“如果你不让他们带你去花园,”玛丽恳求道，“也许——我几乎可以肯定，有时我能找到进去的方法。然后ーー如果医生想让你坐在椅子上出去，如果你总是能做你想做的事情，也许ーー也许我们可以找个男孩来推你，我们可以单独去，那里永远是一个秘密花园。”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source">
“I should—like—that,” he said very slowly, his eyes
looking dreamy. “I should like that. I should not mind fresh air in a
secret garden.”
</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
Mary began to recover her breath and feel safer because the idea of keeping the
secret seemed to please him. She felt almost sure that if she kept on talking
and could make him see the garden in his mind as she had seen it he would like
it so much that he could not bear to think that everybody might tramp in to it
when they chose.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">玛丽开始恢复呼吸，感到安全，因为保守秘密的想法似乎使他高兴。她几乎可以肯定，如果她继续说下去，并且能让他在脑海里看到她所看到的那个花园，他会非常喜欢它，以至于他不敢想象，每个人都可能在他们选择的时候闯进去。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“I’ll tell you what I <i>think</i> it would be like, if we could go
into it,” she said. “It has been shut up so long things have grown
into a tangle perhaps.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">她说: “我来告诉你我的想法，如果我们可以深入了解的话。”。“它被关闭了这么长时间，事情可能已经变成了一团乱麻。”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
He lay quite still and listened while she went on talking about the roses which
<i>might</i> have clambered from tree to tree and hung down—about the
many birds which <i>might</i> have built their nests there because it was so
safe. And then she told him about the robin and Ben Weatherstaff, and there was
so much to tell about the robin and it was so easy and safe to talk about it
that she ceased to be afraid. The robin pleased him so much that he smiled
until he looked almost beautiful, and at first Mary had thought that he was
even plainer than herself, with his big eyes and heavy locks of hair.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">他静静地躺着，听着她继续谈论那些可能从一棵树爬到另一棵树上然后挂下来的玫瑰花，谈论那些可能在那里筑巢的鸟儿，因为那里很安全。然后她告诉他关于知更鸟和本 · 威瑟斯塔夫的事情，关于知更鸟有很多事情要说，谈论它是如此容易和安全以至于她不再害怕。知更鸟让他非常高兴，他笑了起来，直到他看起来几乎很漂亮，起初玛丽认为他甚至比她自己还要平凡，有着大大的眼睛和浓密的头发。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“I did not know birds could be like that,” he said. “But if
you stay in a room you never see things. What a lot of things you know. I feel
as if you had been inside that garden.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">他说: “我不知道鸟儿也能这样。”。“但如果你呆在一个房间里，你永远看不到东西。你知道的太多了。我觉得你就像在那个花园里一样。”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source">
She did not know what to say, so she did not say anything. He evidently did not
expect an answer and the next moment he gave her a surprise.
</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source">
“I am going to let you look at something,” he said. “Do you
see that rose-colored silk curtain hanging on the wall over the
mantel-piece?”
</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source">
Mary had not noticed it before, but she looked up and saw it. It was a curtain
of soft silk hanging over what seemed to be some picture.
</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“Yes,” she answered.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“是的,”她回答。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source">
“There is a cord hanging from it,” said Colin. “Go and pull
it.”
</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
Mary got up, much mystified, and found the cord. When she pulled it the silk
curtain ran back on rings and when it ran back it uncovered a picture. It was
the picture of a girl with a laughing face. She had bright hair tied up with a
blue ribbon and her gay, lovely eyes were exactly like Colin’s unhappy
ones, agate gray and looking twice as big as they really were because of the
black lashes all round them.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">玛丽很困惑地站起来，找到了脐带。当她拉开它时，丝绸窗帘上的戒指又回来了，当它回来的时候，露出了一幅画。那是一张有着笑脸的女孩的照片。她明亮的头发上系着蓝色的丝带，她那双活泼可爱的眼睛和科林那双不开心的眼睛一模一样，玛瑙灰色的，看起来比实际大两倍，因为它们周围都是黑色的睫毛。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source">
“She is my mother,” said Colin complainingly. “I don’t
see why she died. Sometimes I hate her for doing it.”
</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“How queer!” said Mary.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“真奇怪!”玛丽说。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“If she had lived I believe I should not have been ill always,” he
grumbled. “I dare say I should have lived, too. And my father would not
have hated to look at me. I dare say I should have had a strong back. Draw the
curtain again.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“如果她还活着，我相信我不会一直生病,”他抱怨道。我敢说我也应该活下来。我父亲也不会讨厌看到我。我敢说我应该有一个强壮的后背。再把窗帘拉上”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source">
Mary did as she was told and returned to her footstool.
</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source">
“She is much prettier than you,” she said, “but her eyes are
just like yours—at least they are the same shape and color. Why is the
curtain drawn over her?”
</p>

He moved uncomfortably.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">他动得很不舒服。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“I made them do it,” he said. “Sometimes I don’t like
to see her looking at me. She smiles too much when I am ill and miserable.
Besides, she is mine and I don’t want everyone to see her.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“是我让他们这么做的,”他说。“有时我不喜欢看到她看着我。我生病痛苦的时候，她总是笑得很开心。此外，她是我的，我不想让所有人都看到她。”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source">
There were a few moments of silence and then Mary spoke.
</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source">
“What would Mrs. Medlock do if she found out that I had been here?”
she inquired.
</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“She would do as I told her to do,” he answered. “And I
should tell her that I wanted you to come here and talk to me every day. I am
glad you came.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“她会照我说的做,”他回答。我应该告诉她，我希望你每天来这里和我聊天。我很高兴你来了”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source">
“So am I,” said Mary. “I will come as often as I can,
but”—she hesitated—“I shall have to look every day for
the garden door.”
</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source">
“Yes, you must,” said Colin, “and you can tell me about it
afterward.”
</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source">
He lay thinking a few minutes, as he had done before, and then he spoke again.
</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“I think you shall be a secret, too,” he said. “I will not
tell them until they find out. I can always send the nurse out of the room and
say that I want to be by myself. Do you know Martha?”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“我想你也应该是个秘密,”他说。”在他们发现之前，我不会告诉他们。我总是可以让护士离开房间，然后说我想一个人呆着。你认识玛莎吗?”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“Yes, I know her very well,” said Mary. “She waits on
me.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“是的，我非常了解她,”玛丽说，“她在服侍我。”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
He nodded his head toward the outer corridor.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">他朝外面的走廊点点头。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“She is the one who is asleep in the other room. The nurse went away
yesterday to stay all night with her sister and she always makes Martha attend
to me when she wants to go out. Martha shall tell you when to come here.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“她就是那个在另一个房间睡觉的人。护士昨天去陪她妹妹了，她总是让玛莎在她想出去的时候照顾我。玛莎会告诉你什么时候来这里。”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
Then Mary understood Martha’s troubled look when she had asked questions
about the crying.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">这时玛丽才明白玛莎为什么会哭，因为她问了一些关于哭泣的问题。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“Martha knew about you all the time?” she said.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“玛莎一直都知道你的事?”她说。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“Yes; she often attends to me. The nurse likes to get away from me and
then Martha comes.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“是的，她经常照顾我。护士喜欢离开我，然后玛莎就来了。”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“I have been here a long time,” said Mary. “Shall I go away
now? Your eyes look sleepy.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“我在这儿已经很久了,”玛丽说，“我现在可以走了吗? 你的眼睛看起来很困。”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“I wish I could go to sleep before you leave me,” he said rather
shyly.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“我希望我能在你离开我之前睡着,”他有点害羞地说。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“Shut your eyes,” said Mary, drawing her footstool closer,
“and I will do what my Ayah used to do in India. I will pat your hand and
stroke it and sing something quite low.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“闭上你的眼睛,”玛丽说，把她的脚凳拉近一些，“我要做我的阿亚在印度曾经做过的事情。我会拍拍你的手，抚摸它，唱一首低沉的歌”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“I should like that perhaps,” he said drowsily.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“也许我会喜欢的,”他昏昏欲睡地说。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
Somehow she was sorry for him and did not want him to lie awake, so she leaned
against the bed and began to stroke and pat his hand and sing a very low little
chanting song in Hindustani.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">不知为什么，她为他感到难过，不想让他躺在床上睡不着，于是她靠在床上，开始抚摸他的手，轻拍他的手，用印度斯坦语唱了一首非常低沉的诵经歌曲。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“That is nice,” he said more drowsily still, and she went on
chanting and stroking, but when she looked at him again his black lashes were
lying close against his cheeks, for his eyes were shut and he was fast asleep.
So she got up softly, took her candle and crept away without making a sound.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“那很好,”他说得更加困倦了，她继续诵经和抚摸，但是当她再次看着他时，他的黑色睫毛贴着他的脸颊，因为他的眼睛闭着，他睡得很熟。于是她轻轻地站起来，拿起蜡烛，悄无声息地走开了。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
The moor was hidden in mist when the morning came, and the rain had not stopped
pouring down. There could be no going out of doors. Martha was so busy that
Mary had no opportunity of talking to her, but in the afternoon she asked her
to come and sit with her in the nursery. She came bringing the stocking she was
always knitting when she was doing nothing else.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">清晨来临时，沼地隐藏在薄雾中，雨一直没有停下来。不能出门。玛莎太忙了，玛丽没有机会和她说话，但是下午她请玛莎到育儿室来和她坐在一起。她来了，带来了她总是在无所事事的时候编织的丝袜。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“What’s the matter with thee?” she asked as soon as they sat
down. “Tha’ looks as if tha’d somethin’ to say.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“你怎么了?”他们一坐下，她就问道。“你好像有话要说”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“I have. I have found out what the crying was,” said Mary.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“我已经知道了。我已经知道那哭声是怎么回事了。”玛丽说。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source">
Martha let her knitting drop on her knee and gazed at her with startled eyes.
</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“Tha’ hasn’t!” she exclaimed. “Never!”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“你没有!”她叫道，“从来没有!”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source">
“I heard it in the night,” Mary went on. “And I got up and
went to see where it came from. It was Colin. I found him.”
</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
Martha’s face became red with fright.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">玛莎的脸吓得通红。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“Eh! Miss Mary!” she said half crying. “Tha’
shouldn’t have done it—tha’ shouldn’t! Tha’ll get
me in trouble. I never told thee nothin’ about him—but tha’ll
get me in trouble. I shall lose my place and what’ll mother do!”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“呃！玛丽小姐!”她半哭着说。“你不该这么做，你不该这么做！那会给我惹麻烦的。我从来没有告诉过你关于他的任何事情，但是你会给我带来麻烦的。我会失去我的位置，妈妈会怎么做!”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source">
“You won’t lose your place,” said Mary. “He was glad I
came. We talked and talked and he said he was glad I came.”
</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“Was he?” cried Martha. “Art tha’ sure? Tha’
doesn’t know what he’s like when anything vexes him. He’s a
big lad to cry like a baby, but when he’s in a passion he’ll fair
scream just to frighten us. He knows us daren’t call our souls our
own.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“是吗?”玛莎叫道。你确定吗？如果有什么事让他烦恼，他不知道自己是什么样的人。他是个大孩子，哭得像个孩子，但是当他激动的时候，他会尖叫只是为了吓唬我们。他知道我们不敢把灵魂称为自己的”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source">
“He wasn’t vexed,” said Mary. “I asked him if I should
go away and he made me stay. He asked me questions and I sat on a big footstool
and talked to him about India and about the robin and gardens. He
wouldn’t let me go. He let me see his mother’s picture. Before I
left him I sang him to sleep.”
</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
Martha fairly gasped with amazement.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">玛莎相当惊讶地倒吸了一口凉气。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source">
“I can scarcely believe thee!” she protested. “It’s as
if tha’d walked straight into a lion’s den. If he’d been like
he is most times he’d have throwed himself into one of his tantrums and
roused th’ house. He won’t let strangers look at him.”
</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source">
“He let me look at him. I looked at him all the time and he looked at me.
We stared!” said Mary.
</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source">
“I don’t know what to do!” cried agitated Martha. “If
Mrs. Medlock finds out, she’ll think I broke orders and told thee and I
shall be packed back to mother.”
</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“He is not going to tell Mrs. Medlock anything about it yet. It’s
to be a sort of secret just at first,” said Mary firmly. “And he
says everybody is obliged to do as he pleases.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“他不会告诉梅德洛克夫人任何关于这件事的。刚开始这是个秘密,”玛丽坚定地说。“他说，每个人都有义务随心所欲。”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source">
“Aye, that’s true enough—th’ bad lad!” sighed
Martha, wiping her forehead with her apron.
</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source">
“He says Mrs. Medlock must. And he wants me to come and talk to him every
day. And you are to tell me when he wants me.”
</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source">
“Me!” said Martha; “I shall lose my place—I shall for
sure!”
</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source">
“You can’t if you are doing what he wants you to do and everybody
is ordered to obey him,” Mary argued.
</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source">
“Does tha’ mean to say,” cried Martha with wide open eyes,
“that he was nice to thee!”
</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“I think he almost liked me,” Mary answered.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“我想他几乎喜欢上我了,”玛丽回答。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“Then tha’ must have bewitched him!” decided Martha, drawing
a long breath.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“那你一定是迷惑了他!”玛莎深吸了一口气，断定道。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“Do you mean Magic?” inquired Mary. “I’ve heard about
Magic in India, but I can’t make it. I just went into his room and I was
so surprised to see him I stood and stared. And then he turned round and stared
at me. And he thought I was a ghost or a dream and I thought perhaps he was.
And it was so queer being there alone together in the middle of the night and
not knowing about each other. And we began to ask each other questions. And
when I asked him if I must go away he said I must not.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“你是说魔法吗?”玛丽问。“我听说过印度的魔术，但是我不能去。我只是走进他的房间，看到他我很惊讶，我站在那里盯着他看。然后他转过身来盯着我。他以为我是个鬼魂或者梦境，我以为他是。大半夜独自一人呆在那里，却不知道对方的存在，真是太奇怪了。我们开始互相问问题。当我问他我是否必须离开时，他说我不能离开。”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“Th’ world’s comin’ to a end!” gasped Martha.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“世界末日要来了!”玛莎气喘吁吁地说。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“What is the matter with him?” asked Mary.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“他怎么了?”玛丽问。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“Nobody knows for sure and certain,” said Martha. “Mr. Craven
went off his head like when he was born. Th’ doctors thought he’d
have to be put in a ’sylum. It was because Mrs. Craven died like I told
you. He wouldn’t set eyes on th’ baby. He just raved and said
it’d be another hunchback like him and it’d better die.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“没有人确切地知道,”玛莎说。克雷文先生就像刚出生时一样。医生认为他应该进精神病院。那是因为克雷文太太死了，就像我告诉你的那样。他不肯见孩子。他只是胡言乱语，说会是另一个像他一样的驼背，最好死掉。”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“Is Colin a hunchback?” Mary asked. “He didn’t look
like one.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“科林是驼背吗?”玛丽问。“他看起来不像。”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“He isn’t yet,” said Martha. “But he began all wrong.
Mother said that there was enough trouble and raging in th’ house to set
any child wrong. They was afraid his back was weak an’ they’ve
always been takin’ care of it—keepin’ him lyin’ down
and not lettin’ him walk. Once they made him wear a brace but he fretted
so he was downright ill. Then a big doctor came to see him an’ made them
take it off. He talked to th’ other doctor quite rough—in a polite
way. He said there’d been too much medicine and too much lettin’
him have his own way.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“他还没有,”玛莎说。但他一开始就错了。妈妈说家里有太多的麻烦和愤怒，足以让任何一个孩子犯错。他们担心他的背不好，所以一直在照顾他让他躺着，不让他走路。有一次他们让他戴上牙套，但是他很烦躁，所以他病得很重。然后一个大医生来看他，让他们把它摘下来。他对另一个医生说话很粗鲁ーー用一种礼貌的方式。他说我们给了他太多的药，太多的让他为所欲为。”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“I think he’s a very spoiled boy,” said Mary.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“我觉得他是个被宠坏了的孩子,”玛丽说。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“He’s th’ worst young nowt as ever was!” said Martha.
“I won’t say as he hasn’t been ill a good bit. He’s had
coughs an’ colds that’s nearly killed him two or three times. Once
he had rheumatic fever an’ once he had typhoid. Eh! Mrs. Medlock did get
a fright then. He’d been out of his head an’ she was talkin’
to th’ nurse, thinkin’ he didn’t know nothin’,
an’ she said, ‘He’ll die this time sure enough, an’
best thing for him an’ for everybody.’ An’ she looked at him
an’ there he was with his big eyes open, starin’ at her as sensible
as she was herself. She didn’t know wha’d happen but he just stared
at her an’ says, ‘You give me some water an’ stop
talkin’.’”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“他是最糟糕的年轻人，一如既往!”玛莎说。“我不会说，因为他病得不轻。他咳嗽感冒，两三次几乎要了他的命。有一次他得了风湿热，有一次他得了伤寒。呃！梅德洛克夫人当时确实吓了一跳。他疯了，她跟护士说，以为他什么都不知道，她说，这次他肯定会死，这对他和大家都好。她看着他，而他就在那儿，睁着一双大眼睛，盯着她，就像她自己一样理智。她不知道会发生什么事，但他只是盯着她，说，“你给我一些水，停止说话。”。”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“Do you think he will die?” asked Mary.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“你认为他会死吗?”玛丽问。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“Mother says there’s no reason why any child should live that gets
no fresh air an’ doesn’t do nothin’ but lie on his back
an’ read picture-books an’ take medicine. He’s weak and hates
th’ trouble o’ bein’ taken out o’ doors, an’ he
gets cold so easy he says it makes him ill.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“妈妈说，没有任何理由让孩子活在没有新鲜空气的环境中，他们什么也不做，只是躺在床上，看图画书，吃药。他很虚弱，讨厌被带出门的麻烦，而且他很容易感冒，所以他说感冒会让他生病。”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
Mary sat and looked at the fire.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">玛丽坐着看火。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“I wonder,” she said slowly, “if it would not do him good to
go out into a garden and watch things growing. It did me good.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“我不知道,”她慢慢地说，“如果他出去到花园里看东西生长会不会对他有好处。这对我有好处。”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“One of th’ worst fits he ever had,” said Martha, “was
one time they took him out where the roses is by the fountain. He’d been
readin’ in a paper about people gettin’ somethin’ he called
‘rose cold’ an’ he began to sneeze an’ said he’d
got it an’ then a new gardener as didn’t know th’ rules
passed by an’ looked at him curious. He threw himself into a passion
an’ he said he’d looked at him because he was going to be a
hunchback. He cried himself into a fever an’ was ill all night.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">玛莎说: “有一次，他们把他带到喷泉边的玫瑰花丛里，这是他经历过的最糟糕的一次。他一直在读一篇论文，说人们得到了一种他称之为“玫瑰冷”的东西，他开始打喷嚏，说他得到了，然后一个新的园丁不知道这些规则，好奇地看着他。他全身心投入到一种激情中，他说他之所以看着他，是因为他将成为一个驼背。他哭得发烧，病了一整夜。”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“If he ever gets angry at me, I’ll never go and see him
again,” said Mary.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“如果他再生我的气，我就再也不去看他了,”玛丽说。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“He’ll have thee if he wants thee,” said Martha.
“Tha’ may as well know that at th’ start.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“如果他想要你，他就会得到你,”玛莎说，“你不妨从一开始就知道这一点。”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
Very soon afterward a bell rang and she rolled up her knitting.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">不久之后，铃声响了，她卷起了针线活。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“I dare say th’ nurse wants me to stay with him a bit,” she
said. “I hope he’s in a good temper.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“我敢说护士想让我陪他一会儿,”她说。“我希望他心情好”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
She was out of the room about ten minutes and then she came back with a puzzled
expression.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">她离开房间大约十分钟，然后带着困惑的表情回来了。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“Well, tha’ has bewitched him,” she said. “He’s
up on his sofa with his picture-books. He’s told the nurse to stay away
until six o’clock. I’m to wait in the next room. Th’ minute
she was gone he called me to him an’ says, ‘I want Mary Lennox to
come and talk to me, and remember you’re not to tell anyone.’
You’d better go as quick as you can.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“嗯，你迷住了他,”她说。他躺在沙发上，手里拿着图画书。他已经告诉护士六点前不要靠近。我要在隔壁房间等。她一走，他就打电话给我，说: “我要玛丽 · 伦诺克斯过来和我谈谈，记住你不能告诉任何人。”。你最好尽快离开</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
Mary was quite willing to go quickly. She did not want to see Colin as much as
she wanted to see Dickon; but she wanted to see him very much.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">玛丽很愿意快点走。她不像想见迪肯那样想见科林，但她非常想见他。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
There was a bright fire on the hearth when she entered his room, and in the
daylight she saw it was a very beautiful room indeed. There were rich colors in
the rugs and hangings and pictures and books on the walls which made it look
glowing and comfortable even in spite of the gray sky and falling rain. Colin
looked rather like a picture himself. He was wrapped in a velvet dressing-gown
and sat against a big brocaded cushion. He had a red spot on each cheek.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">当她走进他的房间时，壁炉里有一堆明亮的火，在白天她看到的确是一个非常漂亮的房间。地毯、挂件、图画和墙上的书籍都有丰富的色彩，即使在灰蒙蒙的天空和下着雨的天气里，它们看起来依然光彩照人，令人感到舒适。科林自己看起来也很像一幅画。他裹着一件天鹅绒睡袍，靠着一个绣花大靠垫坐着。他两边脸颊上都有一个红点。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“Come in,” he said. “I’ve been thinking about you all
morning.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“进来吧,”他说，“我整个上午都在想你。”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“I’ve been thinking about you, too,” answered Mary.
“You don’t know how frightened Martha is. She says Mrs. Medlock
will think she told me about you and then she will be sent away.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“我也一直在想你,”玛丽回答。你不知道玛莎有多害怕。她说梅德洛克夫人会以为她告诉了我你的事然后她就会被送走”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
He frowned.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">他皱起了眉头。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“Go and tell her to come here,” he said. “She is in the next
room.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“去告诉她到这儿来,”他说，“她在隔壁房间。”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
Mary went and brought her back. Poor Martha was shaking in her shoes. Colin was
still frowning.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">玛丽去把她带回来。可怜的玛莎吓得发抖。科林仍然皱着眉头。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“Have you to do what I please or have you not?” he demanded.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“你到底要不要做我喜欢的事?”他问道。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“I have to do what you please, sir,” Martha faltered, turning quite
red.

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“Has Medlock to do what I please?”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“梅德洛克能随心所欲吗”</p>

“Everybody has, sir,” said Martha.

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“Well, then, if I order you to bring Miss Mary to me, how can Medlock
send you away if she finds it out?”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“好吧，那么，如果我命令你把玛丽小姐带来见我，如果被梅德洛克发现了，她怎么能把你送走呢?”</p>

“Please don’t let her, sir,” pleaded Martha.

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“I’ll send <i>her</i> away if she dares to say a word about such a

sir.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“谢谢你，先生,”他行了个屈膝礼，“我想尽我的职责，先生。”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“What I want is your duty” said Colin more grandly still.
“I’ll take care of you. Now go away.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“我想要的是你的责任,”科林更加豪气地说，“我会照顾你的。现在你走吧。”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
When the door closed behind Martha, Colin found Mistress Mary gazing at him as
if he had set her wondering.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">当玛莎身后的门关上的时候，科林发现玛丽太太正盯着他，好像他已经引起了她的好奇。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“Why do you look at me like that?” he asked her. “What are
you thinking about?”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“你为什么那样看着我?”他问她。“你在想什么?”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“I am thinking about two things.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“我在想两件事。”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“What are they? Sit down and tell me.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“它们是什么? 坐下来告诉我”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“This is the first one,” said Mary, seating herself on the big
stool. “Once in India I saw a boy who was a Rajah. He had rubies and
emeralds and diamonds stuck all over him. He spoke to his people just as you
spoke to Martha. Everybody had to do everything he told them—in a minute.
I think they would have been killed if they hadn’t.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“这是第一个,”玛丽说，坐在大凳子上。“有一次在印度，我看到一个男孩，他是一个国王。他身上到处都是红宝石，绿宝石和钻石。他和他的人说话，就像你和玛莎说话一样。每个人都必须按他说的做ーー一分钟之内。我认为如果他们不这么做，他们早就被杀了。”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“I shall make you tell me about Rajahs presently,” he said,
“but first tell me what the second thing was.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“现在我要你告诉我关于拉贾的事,”他说，“但首先告诉我第二件事是什么。”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“I was thinking,” said Mary, “how different you are from
Dickon.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“我在想,”玛丽说，“你和狄肯有多么不同。”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“Who is Dickon?” he said. “What a queer name!”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“迪肯是谁?”他说，“多么奇怪的名字!”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
She might as well tell him, she thought she could talk about Dickon without
mentioning the secret garden. She had liked to hear Martha talk about him.
Besides, she longed to talk about him. It would seem to bring him nearer.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">她不妨告诉他，她认为她可以不提秘密花园而谈论迪肯。她喜欢听玛莎谈论他。而且，她很想谈谈他。似乎能让他更接近我。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“He is Martha’s brother. He is twelve years old,” she
explained. “He is not like anyone else in the world. He can charm foxes
and squirrels and birds just as the natives in India charm snakes. He plays a
very soft tune on a pipe and they come and listen.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">他是玛莎的哥哥。他十二岁了,”她解释说。“他和世界上的任何人都不一样。他可以迷惑狐狸、松鼠和鸟类，就像印度当地人迷惑蛇一样。他用一根管子弹奏一首非常柔和的曲子，他们就过来听。”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
There were some big books on a table at his side and he dragged one suddenly
toward him.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">他旁边的桌子上有几本大书，他突然拉过来一本。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“There is a picture of a snake-charmer in this,” he exclaimed.
“Come and look at it.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“这里面有一张耍蛇人的照片,”他叫道，“过来看看。”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
The book was a beautiful one with superb colored illustrations and he turned to
one of them.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">这本书很漂亮，配有精美的彩色插图，他转向其中一本。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“Can he do that?” he asked eagerly.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“他能做到吗?”他急切地问。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“He played on his pipe and they listened,” Mary explained.
“But he doesn’t call it Magic. He says it’s because he lives
on the moor so much and he knows their ways. He says he feels sometimes as if
he was a bird or a rabbit himself, he likes them so. I think he asked the robin
questions. It seemed as if they talked to each other in soft chirps.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“他吹着笛子，他们听着,”玛丽解释说。但他不叫它魔法。他说那是因为他经常住在沼地上，而且他了解他们的生活方式。他说，有时候他觉得自己就像一只鸟或一只兔子，他非常喜欢它们。我觉得他问了 Robin 一些问题。他们似乎在轻声交谈。”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
Colin lay back on his cushion and his eyes grew larger and larger and the spots
on his cheeks burned.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">科林躺在靠垫上，他的眼睛越来越大，脸颊上的斑点越来越明显。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“Tell me some more about him,” he said.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“再跟我说说他吧,”他说。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“He knows all about eggs and nests,” Mary went on. “And he
knows where foxes and badgers and otters live. He keeps them secret so that
other boys won’t find their holes and frighten them. He knows about
everything that grows or lives on the moor.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“他知道所有关于蛋和巢的事情,”玛丽继续说。他知道狐狸，獾和水獭住在哪里。他把他们藏起来，这样其他男孩就不会发现他们的洞，吓到他们。他知道沼地上生长和生活的一切</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“Does he like the moor?” said Colin. “How can he when
it’s such a great, bare, dreary place?”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“他喜欢沼地吗?”科林说，“那是一个如此美丽、荒凉、沉闷的地方，他怎么能喜欢呢?”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“It’s the most beautiful place,” protested Mary.
“Thousands of lovely things grow on it and there are thousands of little
creatures all busy building nests and making holes and burrows and chippering
or singing or squeaking to each other. They are so busy and having such fun
under the earth or in the trees or heather. It’s their world.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“这是最美丽的地方,”玛丽抗议道。“成千上万可爱的东西生长在上面，成千上万的小生物忙着筑巢、挖洞、唱歌或者相互吱吱叫。他们是如此的忙碌，在地下、树林或石南花丛中玩得如此开心。这是他们的世界”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“How do you know all that?” said Colin, turning on his elbow to
look at her.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“你怎么知道这些的?”科林说，用胳膊肘转过来看着她。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“I have never been there once, really,” said Mary suddenly
remembering. “I only drove over it in the dark. I thought it was hideous.
Martha told me about it first and then Dickon. When Dickon talks about it you
feel as if you saw things and heard them and as if you were standing in the
heather with the sun shining and the gorse smelling like honey—and all
full of bees and butterflies.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“我从来没有去过那里，真的,”玛丽突然想起来了。我只是在黑暗中开车经过。我觉得很可怕。玛莎先告诉我的，然后是迪肯。当迪肯谈起这件事的时候，你感觉自己好像看到了什么，听到了什么，就好像你站在石南花丛中，阳光明媚，金雀花闻起来像蜂蜜ーー到处都是蜜蜂和蝴蝶。”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“You never see anything if you are ill,” said Colin restlessly. He
looked like a person listening to a new sound in the distance and wondering
what it was.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“如果你生病了，你什么也看不见,”科林焦躁不安地说。他看上去就像一个人在远处听着一个新的声音，想知道那是什么。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“You can’t if you stay in a room,” said Mary.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“如果你呆在一个房间里，你就不能。”玛丽说。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“I couldn’t go on the moor,” he said in a resentful tone.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“我不能去荒野,”他愤愤不平地说。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
Mary was silent for a minute and then she said something bold.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">玛丽沉默了一会儿，然后说了一些大胆的话。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“You might—sometime.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“也许有一天你会的。”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
He moved as if he were startled.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">他动了一下，好像受到了惊吓。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“Go on the moor! How could I? I am going to die.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“去荒野吧! 我怎么能去? 我要死了”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“How do you know?” said Mary unsympathetically. She didn’t
like the way he had of talking about dying. She did not feel very sympathetic.
She felt rather as if he almost boasted about it.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“你怎么知道?”玛丽冷漠地说。她不喜欢他谈论死亡的方式。她不觉得很有同情心。她觉得他几乎是在吹嘘这件事。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“Oh, I’ve heard it ever since I remember,” he answered
crossly. “They are always whispering about it and thinking I don’t
notice. They wish I would, too.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“哦，我从记事起就听说过了,”他生气地回答。“他们总是窃窃私语，以为我没注意到。他们也希望我这么做。”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
Mistress Mary felt quite contrary. She pinched her lips together.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">玛丽太太觉得很矛盾，她抿紧了嘴唇。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“If they wished I would,” she said, “I wouldn’t. Who
wishes you would?”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“如果他们希望我会,”她说，“我不会。谁希望你会呢?”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“The servants—and of course Dr. Craven because he would get
Misselthwaite and be rich instead of poor. He daren’t say so, but he
always looks cheerful when I am worse. When I had typhoid fever his face got
quite fat. I think my father wishes it, too.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“仆人们ーー当然还有克雷文医生，因为他会得到米瑟斯韦特，变得富有而不是贫穷。他不敢这么说，但是当我病情恶化时，他总是看起来很高兴。当我得了伤寒时，他的脸变得很胖。我想我父亲也希望如此。”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“I don’t believe he does,” said Mary quite obstinately.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“我相信他不知道,”玛丽十分固执地说。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source">
That made Colin turn and look at her again.
</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“Don’t you?” he said.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“难道你不是吗?”他说。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
And then he lay back on his cushion and was still, as if he were thinking. And
there was quite a long silence. Perhaps they were both of them thinking strange
things children do not usually think of.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">然后他躺在靠垫上，一动不动，好像在思考。沉默了很长时间。也许他们俩都在想一些孩子们通常不会想到的奇怪的事情。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source">
“I like the grand doctor from London, because he made them take the iron
thing off,” said Mary at last “Did he say you were going to
die?”
</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“No.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“不”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“What did he say?”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“他说什么?”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“He didn’t whisper,” Colin answered. “Perhaps he knew I
hated whispering. I heard him say one thing quite aloud. He said, ‘The
lad might live if he would make up his mind to it. Put him in the humor.’
It sounded as if he was in a temper.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“他没有低声说话,”科林回答。也许他知道我讨厌窃窃私语。我听到他大声说了一件事。他说: “如果他下定决心，这孩子也许能活下来。”。让他有点幽默感。听起来他好像在发脾气。”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“I’ll tell you who would put you in the humor, perhaps,” said
Mary reflecting. She felt as if she would like this thing to be settled one way
or the other. “I believe Dickon would. He’s always talking about
live things. He never talks about dead things or things that are ill.
He’s always looking up in the sky to watch birds flying—or looking
down at the earth to see something growing. He has such round blue eyes and
they are so wide open with looking about. And he laughs such a big laugh with
his wide mouth—and his cheeks are as red—as red as cherries.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“也许我可以告诉你是谁让你这么开心的,”玛丽沉思着说。她觉得好像她希望这件事以这样或那样的方式解决。我相信迪肯会的。他总是谈论活的东西。他从不谈论死去的东西或生病的东西。他总是仰望天空看鸟儿飞翔，或者低头看地球看生长着什么东西。他有一双圆圆的蓝眼睛，四处张望时，眼睛是那么大。他笑得那么大声，他的大嘴巴笑得那么大声，他的脸颊红得像樱桃一样。”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source">
She pulled her stool nearer to the sofa and her expression quite changed at the
remembrance of the wide curving mouth and wide open eyes.
</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“See here,” she said. “Don’t let us talk about dying; I
don’t like it. Let us talk about living. Let us talk and talk about
Dickon. And then we will look at your pictures.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“看这里,”她说。“别让我们谈论死亡，我不喜欢死亡。我们来谈谈生活吧。我们谈谈迪肯吧。然后我们再看你的照片”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
It was the best thing she could have said. To talk about Dickon meant to talk
about the moor and about the cottage and the fourteen people who lived in it on
sixteen shillings a week—and the children who got fat on the moor grass
like the wild ponies. And about Dickon’s mother—and the
skipping-rope—and the moor with the sun on it—and about pale green
points sticking up out of the black sod. And it was all so alive that Mary
talked more than she had ever talked before—and Colin both talked and
listened as he had never done either before. And they both began to laugh over
nothings as children will when they are happy together. And they laughed so
that in the end they were making as much noise as if they had been two ordinary
healthy natural ten-year-old creatures—instead of a hard, little,
unloving girl and a sickly boy who believed that he was going to die.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">这是她能说的最好的话了。谈论迪肯意味着谈论沼泽和小屋，谈论每周靠16先令生活在里面的14个人，谈论那些在沼泽草地上像野马一样发胖的孩子。还有迪肯的母亲ーー还有那条跳绳ーー还有那片有太阳的沼地ーー还有那些从黑色草皮上伸出来的淡绿色尖角。这一切都是如此生动，以至于玛丽说的话比以往任何时候都多ーー科林也像以往任何时候一样说话、听话。当他们在一起快乐的时候，他们开始像孩子一样为一些无关紧要的事情大笑。他们笑了起来，最后他们发出的声音就好像他们是两个普通的健康的自然的十岁生物ー而不是一个坚强的，小的，没有爱心的女孩和一个生病的男孩，相信他会死去。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
They enjoyed themselves so much that they forgot the pictures and they forgot
about the time. They had been laughing quite loudly over Ben Weatherstaff and
his robin, and Colin was actually sitting up as if he had forgotten about his
weak back, when he suddenly remembered something.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">他们玩得很开心，以至于忘记了照片和时间。他们一直在为本 · 威瑟斯塔夫和他的知更鸟大笑，科林实际上是坐起来的，好像他已经忘记了自己虚弱的背部，这时他突然想起了什么。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source">
“Do you know there is one thing we have never once thought of,” he
said. “We are cousins.”
</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
It seemed so queer that they had talked so much and never remembered this
simple thing that they laughed more than ever, because they had got into the
humor to laugh at anything. And in the midst of the fun the door opened and in
walked Dr. Craven and Mrs. Medlock.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">他们说了那么多话，却从来不记得这件简单的事情，这似乎很奇怪，以至于他们笑得比以往任何时候都多，因为他们已经进入了对任何事情都笑的幽默状态。在欢乐的气氛中，门开了，克雷文医生和梅德洛克太太走了进来。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source">
Dr. Craven started in actual alarm and Mrs. Medlock almost fell back because he
had accidentally bumped against her.
</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source">
“Good Lord!” exclaimed poor Mrs. Medlock with her eyes almost
starting out of her head. “Good Lord!”
</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source">
“What is this?” said Dr. Craven, coming forward. “What does
it mean?”
</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
Then Mary was reminded of the boy Rajah again. Colin answered as if neither the
doctor’s alarm nor Mrs. Medlock’s terror were of the slightest
consequence. He was as little disturbed or frightened as if an elderly cat and
dog had walked into the room.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">这时玛丽又想起了那个叫拉贾的男孩。科林回答说，好像医生的警报和梅德洛克太太的恐惧都没有造成任何影响。他几乎没有受到什么干扰或惊吓，就好像一只老猫和老狗走进了房间。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“This is my cousin, Mary Lennox,” he said. “I asked her to
come and talk to me. I like her. She must come and talk to me whenever I send
for her.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“这是我的表妹，玛丽 · 伦诺克斯,”他说。“我让她过来和我谈谈。我喜欢她。无论我什么时候叫她，她都必须来和我说话。”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source">
Dr. Craven turned reproachfully to Mrs. Medlock.
</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source">
“Oh, sir” she panted. “I don’t know how it’s
happened. There’s not a servant on the place tha’d dare to
talk—they all have their orders.”
</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source">
“Nobody told her anything,” said Colin. “She heard me crying
and found me herself. I am glad she came. Don’t be silly, Medlock.”
</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source">
Mary saw that Dr. Craven did not look pleased, but it was quite plain that he
dare not oppose his patient. He sat down by Colin and felt his pulse.
</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source">
“I am afraid there has been too much excitement. Excitement is not good
for you, my boy,” he said.
</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source">
“I should be excited if she kept away,” answered Colin, his eyes
beginning to look dangerously sparkling. “I am better. She makes me
better. The nurse must bring up her tea with mine. We will have tea
together.”
</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source">
Mrs. Medlock and Dr. Craven looked at each other in a troubled way, but there
was evidently nothing to be done.
</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source">
“He does look rather better, sir,” ventured Mrs. Medlock.
“But”—thinking the matter over—“he looked better
this morning before she came into the room.”
</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source">
“She came into the room last night. She stayed with me a long time. She
sang a Hindustani song to me and it made me go to sleep,” said Colin.
“I was better when I wakened up. I wanted my breakfast. I want my tea
now. Tell nurse, Medlock.”
</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
Dr. Craven did not stay very long. He talked to the nurse for a few minutes
when she came into the room and said a few words of warning to Colin. He must
not talk too much; he must not forget that he was ill; he must not forget that
he was very easily tired. Mary thought that there seemed to be a number of
uncomfortable things he was not to forget.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">克雷文医生没待多久。当护士走进房间时，他和她谈了几分钟，并对科林说了几句警告的话。他不能说得太多; 他不能忘记他生病了; 他不能忘记他很容易疲劳。玛丽觉得好像有一些令人不舒服的事情是他不能忘记的。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source">
Colin looked fretful and kept his strange black-lashed eyes fixed on Dr.
Craven’s face.
</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source">
“I <i>want</i> to forget it,” he said at last. “She makes me
forget it. That is why I want her.”
</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
Dr. Craven did not look happy when he left the room. He gave a puzzled glance
at the little girl sitting on the large stool. She had become a stiff, silent
child again as soon as he entered and he could not see what the attraction was.
The boy actually did look brighter, however—and he sighed rather heavily
as he went down the corridor.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">克雷文医生离开房间时看起来不太高兴。他疑惑地看了坐在大凳子上的小女孩一眼。他一进门，她就变成了一个呆板、沉默的孩子，他看不出有什么吸引人的地方。然而，这个男孩确实看起来更聪明了ーー当他走过走廊时，他深深地叹了口气。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“They are always wanting me to eat things when I don’t want
to,” said Colin, as the nurse brought in the tea and put it on the table
by the sofa. “Now, if you’ll eat I will. Those muffins look so nice
and hot. Tell me about Rajahs.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“他们总是要我在不想吃的时候吃东西,”科林说，护士把茶端进来，放在沙发边的桌子上。“现在，如果你愿意吃，我愿意。这些松饼看起来真好吃又热。跟我说说 Rajahs”</p>

NEST BUILDING<font class="cyxy-trs-target"> 鸟巢大楼</font></h2>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
After another week of rain the high arch of blue sky appeared again and the sun
which poured down was quite hot. Though there had been no chance to see either
the secret garden or Dickon, Mistress Mary had enjoyed herself very much. The
week had not seemed long. She had spent hours of every day with Colin in his
room, talking about Rajahs or gardens or Dickon and the cottage on the moor.
They had looked at the splendid books and pictures and sometimes Mary had read
things to Colin, and sometimes he had read a little to her. When he was amused
and interested she thought he scarcely looked like an invalid at all, except
that his face was so colorless and he was always on the sofa.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">又下了一个星期的雨，高高的蓝天又出现了，倾泻而下的太阳很热。虽然没有机会看到秘密花园或狄肯，玛丽太太却玩得很开心。这个星期看起来并不长。她每天花几个小时和科林呆在他的房间里，谈论拉贾、花园或迪肯和荒野上的小屋。他们看了那些精美的书籍和图画，有时玛丽给科林读东西，有时他给她读一点。当他被逗乐并且感兴趣的时候，她认为他看起来一点也不像个病人，除了他的脸色是那么苍白，而且他总是坐在沙发上。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“You are a sly young one to listen and get out of your bed to go
following things up like you did that night,” Mrs. Medlock said once.
“But there’s no saying it’s not been a sort of blessing to
the lot of us. He’s not had a tantrum or a whining fit since you made
friends. The nurse was just going to give up the case because she was so sick
of him, but she says she doesn’t mind staying now you’ve gone on
duty with her,” laughing a little.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“你真是个狡猾的年轻人，竟然像那天晚上那样，听别人的话，下床去做事情。”梅德洛克太太曾经说过。“但不可否认，这对我们大多数人来说是一种恩赐。自从你交了朋友，他就没发过脾气，也没发过牢骚。护士本来打算放弃这个病例，因为她实在是太讨厌他了，但是她说她不介意留下来，因为你已经和她一起值班了。”。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
In her talks with Colin, Mary had tried to be very cautious about the secret
garden. There were certain things she wanted to find out from him, but she felt
that she must find them out without asking him direct questions. In the first
place, as she began to like to be with him, she wanted to discover whether he
was the kind of boy you could tell a secret to. He was not in the least like
Dickon, but he was evidently so pleased with the idea of a garden no one knew
anything about that she thought perhaps he could be trusted. But she had not
known him long enough to be sure. The second thing she wanted to find out was
this: If he could be trusted—if he really could—wouldn’t it
be possible to take him to the garden without having anyone find it out? The
grand doctor had said that he must have fresh air and Colin had said that he
would not mind fresh air in a secret garden. Perhaps if he had a great deal of
fresh air and knew Dickon and the robin and saw things growing he might not
think so much about dying. Mary had seen herself in the glass sometimes lately
when she had realized that she looked quite a different creature from the child
she had seen when she arrived from India. This child looked nicer. Even Martha
had seen a change in her.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">在与科林的谈话中，玛丽试图对秘密花园非常谨慎。有些事情她想从他身上找出来，但她觉得她必须在不直接问他的情况下找出来。首先，当她开始喜欢和他在一起时，她想知道他是不是那种你可以告诉他一个秘密的男孩。他一点也不像狄肯，但他显然对一个没有人知道任何事情的花园的想法感到非常高兴，因此她认为他也许是可以信任的。但她认识他的时间还不够长，不能确定。她想知道的第二件事是: 如果他可以被信任ーー如果他真的可以ーー是否有可能带他去花园而不被任何人发现？大医生说他必须呼吸新鲜空气，科林说他不介意在秘密花园里呼吸新鲜空气。也许，如果他呼吸到大量的新鲜空气，认识迪肯和知更鸟，看到东西在生长，他就不会那么想死了。玛丽最近有时会在玻璃里看到自己，因为她意识到自己看起来和从印度来时看到的孩子完全不一样。这孩子看起来好多了。连玛莎都看到了她的变化。</p>

“Th’ air from th’ moor has done thee good already,” she
had said. “Tha’rt not nigh so yeller and tha’rt not nigh so

“It’s like me,” said Mary. “It’s growing stronger

“It looks it, for sure,” said Martha, ruffling it up a little round
her face. “Tha’rt not half so ugly when it’s that way

If gardens and fresh air had been good for her perhaps they would be good for
Colin. But then, if he hated people to look at him, perhaps he would not like
to see Dickon.

<p class="cyxy-trs-source">
“Why does it make you angry when you are looked at?” she inquired
one day.
</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“I always hated it,” he answered, “even when I was very
little. Then when they took me to the seaside and I used to lie in my carriage
everybody used to stare and ladies would stop and talk to my nurse and then
they would begin to whisper and I knew then they were saying I shouldn’t
live to grow up. Then sometimes the ladies would pat my cheeks and say
‘Poor child!’ Once when a lady did that I screamed out loud and bit
her hand. She was so frightened she ran away.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“我一直很讨厌它,”他回答说，“即使在我很小的时候。然后当他们带我去海边，我常常躺在我的马车里，每个人都盯着我，女士们会停下来和我的护士说话，然后他们会开始窃窃私语，我知道那时他们在说我不应该活着长大。然后有时女士们会拍拍我的脸颊，说: “可怜的孩子！有一次，一位女士这么做了，我大声尖叫，咬了她的手。她吓坏了，逃走了”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source">
“She thought you had gone mad like a dog,” said Mary, not at all
admiringly.
</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source">
“I don’t care what she thought,” said Colin, frowning.
</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source">
“I wonder why you didn’t scream and bite me when I came into your
room?” said Mary. Then she began to smile slowly.
</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source">
“I thought you were a ghost or a dream,” he said. “You
can’t bite a ghost or a dream, and if you scream they don’t
care.”
</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source">
“Would you hate it if—if a boy looked at you?” Mary asked
uncertainly.
</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source">
He lay back on his cushion and paused thoughtfully.
</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“There’s one boy,” he said quite slowly, as if he were
thinking over every word, “there’s one boy I believe I
shouldn’t mind. It’s that boy who knows where the foxes
live—Dickon.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“有一个男孩,”他慢慢地说，仿佛他在仔细考虑每一个字，“有一个男孩我相信我不应该介意。是那个知道狐狸住在哪里的男孩ーー迪肯。”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source">
“I’m sure you wouldn’t mind him,” said Mary.
</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source">
“The birds don’t and other animals,” he said, still thinking
it over, “perhaps that’s why I shouldn’t. He’s a sort
of animal charmer and I am a boy animal.”
</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
Then he laughed and she laughed too; in fact it ended in their both laughing a
great deal and finding the idea of a boy animal hiding in his hole very funny
indeed.

What Mary felt afterward was that she need not fear about Dickon.<br><br>
</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
On that first morning when the sky was blue again Mary wakened very early. The
sun was pouring in slanting rays through the blinds and there was something so
joyous in the sight of it that she jumped out of bed and ran to the window. She
drew up the blinds and opened the window itself and a great waft of fresh,
scented air blew in upon her. The moor was blue and the whole world looked as
if something Magic had happened to it. There were tender little fluting sounds
here and there and everywhere, as if scores of birds were beginning to tune up
for a concert. Mary put her hand out of the window and held it in the sun.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">第一天早晨，当天空又变蓝时，玛丽很早就醒了。阳光透过百叶窗倾斜地照射进来，看到一些令人高兴的东西，她从床上跳下来，跑到窗前。她拉上百叶窗，打开窗户，一股清新芬芳的空气扑面而来。沼泽是蓝色的，整个世界看起来好像发生了什么魔法。这里那里到处都有轻柔的笛声，好像几十只鸟儿开始为音乐会调音。玛丽把手伸出窗外，放在阳光下。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“It’s warm—warm!” she said. “It will make the
green points push up and up and up, and it will make the bulbs and roots work
and struggle with all their might under the earth.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“它是温暖的，温暖的!”她说。“它将使绿点向上推，向上推，向上推，它将使球茎和根发挥作用，竭尽全力在地下挣扎。”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
She kneeled down and leaned out of the window as far as she could, breathing
big breaths and sniffing the air until she laughed because she remembered what
Dickon’s mother had said about the end of his nose quivering like a
rabbit’s.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">她跪下来，尽可能地把身子探出窗外，大口大口地呼吸着，嗅着空气，直到她笑了起来，因为她想起了迪肯的母亲说过的话，他的鼻子末端像兔子一样颤抖着。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“It must be very early,” she said. “The little clouds are all
pink and I’ve never seen the sky look like this. No one is up. I
don’t even hear the stable boys.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“一定是很早了,”她说。“小小的云朵都是粉红色的，我从未见过这样的天空。没人起来。我甚至都没听到马夫的声音”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source">
A sudden thought made her scramble to her feet.
</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source">
“I can’t wait! I am going to see the garden!”
</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
She had learned to dress herself by this time and she put on her clothes in
five minutes. She knew a small side door which she could unbolt herself and she
flew downstairs in her stocking feet and put on her shoes in the hall. She
unchained and unbolted and unlocked and when the door was open she sprang
across the step with one bound, and there she was standing on the grass, which
seemed to have turned green, and with the sun pouring down on her and warm
sweet wafts about her and the fluting and twittering and singing coming from
every bush and tree. She clasped her hands for pure joy and looked up in the
sky and it was so blue and pink and pearly and white and flooded with
springtime light that she felt as if she must flute and sing aloud herself and
knew that thrushes and robins and skylarks could not possibly help it. She ran
around the shrubs and paths towards the secret garden.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">这时她已经学会自己穿衣服了，五分钟就穿上了。她知道有一扇小侧门，她可以自己把门闩打开，她穿着袜子飞下楼，在大厅里穿上鞋子。她解开了锁链，打开了锁，门打开了，她一蹦一跳地跨过台阶，她站在草地上，草地似乎已经变成了绿色，阳光洒在她身上，温暖的甜蜜在她周围飘荡，每一棵灌木和树木都在发出笛声、叽叽喳喳的歌声。她高兴地双手合十，抬头看着天空，天空是如此的蓝，粉红，珍珠般的白，充满了春天的光芒，她觉得她必须自己吹笛子，大声唱歌，她知道画眉，知更鸟和云雀不可能帮助它。她绕着灌木丛和小路跑向秘密花园。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“It is all different already,” she said. “The grass is
greener and things are sticking up everywhere and things are uncurling and
green buds of leaves are showing. This afternoon I am sure Dickon will
come.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“一切都已经不同了,”她说。“绿苑春浓和东西到处都是，东西正在展开，叶子的绿芽正在显现。今天下午迪肯一定会来。”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source">
The long warm rain had done strange things to the herbaceous beds which
bordered the walk by the lower wall. There were things sprouting and pushing
out from the roots of clumps of plants and there were actually here and there
glimpses of royal purple and yellow unfurling among the stems of crocuses. Six
months before Mistress Mary would not have seen how the world was waking up,
but now she missed nothing.
</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source">
When she had reached the place where the door hid itself under the ivy, she was
startled by a curious loud sound. It was the caw—caw of a crow and it
came from the top of the wall, and when she looked up, there sat a big
glossy-plumaged blue-black bird, looking down at her very wisely indeed. She
had never seen a crow so close before and he made her a little nervous, but the
next moment he spread his wings and flapped away across the garden. She hoped
he was not going to stay inside and she pushed the door open wondering if he
would. When she got fairly into the garden she saw that he probably did intend
to stay because he had alighted on a dwarf apple-tree and under the apple-tree
was lying a little reddish animal with a Bushy tail, and both of them were
watching the stooping body and rust-red head of Dickon, who was kneeling on the
grass working hard.
</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source">
Mary flew across the grass to him.
</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“Oh, Dickon! Dickon!” she cried out. “How could you get here
so early! How could you! The sun has only just got up!”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“噢，迪肯！迪肯!”她哭了出来。“你怎么这么早就来了！你怎么能这样！太阳才刚刚升起!”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
He got up himself, laughing and glowing, and tousled; his eyes like a bit of
the sky.

“Eh!” he said. “I was up long before him. How could I have

Seeing him talking to a stranger, the little bushy-tailed animal rose from its
place under the tree and came to him, and the rook, cawing once, flew down from
its branch and settled quietly on his shoulder.

“This is th’ little fox cub,” he said, rubbing the little

They ran from one part of the garden to another and found so many wonders that
they were obliged to remind themselves that they must whisper or speak low. He
showed her swelling leafbuds on rose branches which had seemed dead. He showed
her ten thousand new green points pushing through the mould. They put their
eager young noses close to the earth and sniffed its warmed springtime
breathing; they dug and pulled and laughed low with rapture until Mistress

as poppy red as his.

There was every joy on earth in the secret garden that morning, and in the
midst of them came a delight more delightful than all, because it was more
wonderful. Swiftly something flew across the wall and darted through the trees
to a close grown corner, a little flare of red-breasted bird with something
hanging from its beak. Dickon stood quite still and put his hand on Mary almost
as if they had suddenly found themselves laughing in a church.

Mistress Mary was not at all sure that she knew, as Dickon seemed to, how to

Mary told him her story about the midnight wuthering of the wind which had
wakened her and about the faint far-off sounds of the complaining voice which
had led her down the dark corridors with her candle and had ended with her
opening of the door of the dimly lighted room with the carven four-posted bed
in the corner. When she described the small ivory-white face and the strange
black-rimmed eyes Dickon shook his head.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">玛丽告诉他她的故事，半夜风的呼啸声吵醒了她，远处隐隐约约的抱怨声带着她的蜡烛穿过黑暗的走廊，最后她打开灯光昏暗的房间的门，房间角落里有一张刻着四根木条的床。当她描述那张象牙白的小脸和那双奇怪的黑眼圈时，迪肯摇了摇头。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“Them’s just like his mother’s eyes, only hers was always
laughin’, they say,” he said. “They say as Mr. Craven

his eyes is so like his mother’s an’ yet looks so different in his
miserable bit of a face.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">他说: “他们的眼睛就像他妈妈的眼睛，只不过她的眼睛总是在笑。”。“他们说克雷文先生不忍心在他醒着的时候看到他，因为他的眼睛和他妈妈的很像，但是在他那张可怜的脸上看起来却很不一样。”</p>

“Do you think he wants to die?” whispered Mary.

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“No, but he wishes he’d never been born. Mother she says

“Colin’s so afraid of it himself that he won’t sit up,”
said Mary. “He says he’s always thinking that if he should feel a

The fox was lying on the grass close by him, looking up to ask for a pat now
and then, and Dickon bent down and rubbed his neck softly and thought a few
minutes in silence. Presently he lifted his head and looked round the garden.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">狐狸就躺在他身边的草地上，时不时地抬起头来要他拍一下。迪肯弯下腰，轻轻地揉了揉脖子，沉默地想了几分钟。不一会儿，他抬起头来，环顾了一下花园。</p>

Mary looked and caught her breath a little.

<p class="cyxy-trs-source">
“Why!” she cried, “the gray wall is changing. It is as if a
green mist were creeping over it. It’s almost like a green gauze
veil.”
</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source">
“Aye,” said Dickon. “An’ it’ll be greener and
greener till th’ gray’s all gone. Can tha’ guess what I was
thinkin’?”
</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source">
“I know it was something nice,” said Mary eagerly. “I believe
it was something about Colin.”
</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“I was thinkin’ that if he was out here he wouldn’t be
watchin’ for lumps to grow on his back; he’d be watchin’ for
buds to break on th’ rose-bushes, an’ he’d likely be
healthier,” explained Dickon. “I was wonderin’ if us could
ever get him in th’ humor to come out here an’ lie under th’
trees in his carriage.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">迪肯解释说: “我在想，如果他在这里的话，他就不会注意到背上有没有肿块; 他会注意到玫瑰花丛中有没有破裂的花蕾，而且他可能会更健康。”。“我在想我们能不能让他开开心心地来到这里，躺在他的马车里的树下”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“I’ve been wondering that myself. I’ve thought of it almost
every time I’ve talked to him,” said Mary. “I’ve
wondered if he could keep a secret and I’ve wondered if we could bring
him here without anyone seeing us. I thought perhaps you could push his
carriage. The doctor said he must have fresh air and if he wants us to take him
out no one dare disobey him. He won’t go out for other people and perhaps
they will be glad if he will go out with us. He could order the gardeners to
keep away so they wouldn’t find out.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">我自己也在想。我几乎每次和他谈话时都会想到这个问题。”玛丽说。“我想知道他是否能保守秘密，我想知道我们是否能把他带到这里而不被任何人看到。我想也许你可以推他的马车。医生说他必须呼吸新鲜空气，如果他想让我们带他出去，没有人敢违抗他。他不愿意和别人约会，如果他愿意和我们一起出去，也许他们会很高兴。他可以命令园丁们远离，这样他们就不会发现了。”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source">
Dickon was thinking very hard as he scratched Captain’s back.
</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“It’d be good for him, I’ll warrant,” he said.
“Us’d not be thinkin’ he’d better never been born.
Us’d be just two children watchin’ a garden grow, an’
he’d be another. Two lads an’ a little lass just lookin’ on
at th’ springtime. I warrant it’d be better than doctor’s
stuff.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“这对他有好处，我保证,”他说。我们不会认为他最好不要出生。我们只是两个看着花园成长的孩子，而他是另一个。两个小伙子和一个小姑娘只是看着春天。我保证这比医生的东西要好”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“He’s been lying in his room so long and he’s always been so
afraid of his back that it has made him queer,” said Mary. “He
knows a good many things out of books but he doesn’t know anything else.
He says he has been too ill to notice things and he hates going out of doors
and hates gardens and gardeners. But he likes to hear about this garden because
it is a secret. I daren’t tell him much but he said he wanted to see
it.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">玛丽说: “他在房间里躺了这么长时间，他总是很害怕自己的背，这使他很古怪。”。“他从书本上知道很多东西，但除此之外，他什么都不知道。他说自己病得太重，注意不到任何东西，他讨厌出门，讨厌花园和园丁。但是他喜欢听关于这个花园的事，因为这是个秘密。我不敢告诉他太多，但他说他想看看。”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“Us’ll have him out here sometime for sure,” said Dickon.
“I could push his carriage well enough. Has tha’ noticed how
th’ robin an’ his mate has been workin’ while we’ve
been sittin’ here? Look at him perched on that branch wonderin’
where it’d be best to put that twig he’s got in his beak.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“我们一定会让他来这里的,”迪肯说。我可以很好地推他的马车。你有没有注意到我们坐在这里的时候 Robin 和他的伙伴是怎么工作的？看看它，栖息在树枝上想着把它嘴里的小树枝放在哪里最好</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
He made one of his low whistling calls and the robin turned his head and looked
at him inquiringly, still holding his twig. Dickon spoke to him as Ben
Weatherstaff did, but Dickon’s tone was one of friendly advice.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">他发出一声低低的口哨声，知更鸟转过头来，好奇地看着他，仍然抓着他的小树枝。迪肯像本 · 韦瑟斯塔夫那样对他说话，但迪肯的语气是一种友好的劝告。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“Wheres’ever tha’ puts it,” he said, “it’ll
be all right. Tha’ knew how to build tha’ nest before tha’
came out o’ th’ egg. Get on with thee, lad. Tha’st got no
time to lose.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“不管你把它放在哪里,”他说，“都会没事的。你在蛋出来之前就知道怎么筑巢了。走吧，孩子。没时间浪费了”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“Oh, I do like to hear you talk to him!” Mary said, laughing
delightedly. “Ben Weatherstaff scolds him and makes fun of him, and he
hops about and looks as if he understood every word, and I know he likes it.
Ben Weatherstaff says he is so conceited he would rather have stones thrown at
him than not be noticed.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“哦，我真的很喜欢听你和他说话!”玛丽高兴地笑着说。“ Ben Weatherstaff 责骂他，取笑他，他跳来跳去，看起来好像他听懂了每个字，我知道他喜欢这样。本•威瑟斯塔夫(Ben Weatherstaff)表示，他非常自负，宁愿被扔石头，也不愿被忽视。”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source">
Dickon laughed too and went on talking.
</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“Tha’ knows us won’t trouble thee,” he said to the
robin. “Us is near bein’ wild things ourselves. Us is
nest-buildin’ too, bless thee. Look out tha’ doesn’t tell on
us.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“你知道我们不会麻烦你的,”他对知更鸟说。我们自己也快变成野兽了。我们也在筑巢，保佑你。小心点，你不会告发我们的”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
And though the robin did not answer, because his beak was occupied, Mary knew
that when he flew away with his twig to his own corner of the garden the
darkness of his dew-bright eye meant that he would not tell their secret for
the world.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">尽管知更鸟没有回答，因为它的嘴被占据了，玛丽知道当它带着它的小树枝飞向自己花园的一角时，它那露水般明亮的眼睛的黑暗意味着它不会把它们的秘密告诉这个世界。</p>

“I WON’T!” SAID MARY<font class="cyxy-trs-target"> “我不会的!”玛丽说</font></h2>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
They found a great deal to do that morning and Mary was late in returning to
the house and was also in such a hurry to get back to her work that she quite
forgot Colin until the last moment.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">那天早上，他们发现有很多事情要做，玛丽回家迟到了，而且急于回去工作，直到最后一刻，她才把科林忘得一干二净。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source">
“Tell Colin that I can’t come and see him yet,” she said to
Martha. “I’m very busy in the garden.”
</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
Martha looked rather frightened.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">玛莎看起来很害怕。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source">
“Eh! Miss Mary,” she said, “it may put him all out of humor
when I tell him that.”
</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source">
But Mary was not as afraid of him as other people were and she was not a
self-sacrificing person.
</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source">
“I can’t stay,” she answered. “Dickon’s waiting
for me;” and she ran away.
</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
The afternoon was even lovelier and busier than the morning had been. Already
nearly all the weeds were cleared out of the garden and most of the roses and
trees had been pruned or dug about. Dickon had brought a spade of his own and
he had taught Mary to use all her tools, so that by this time it was plain that
though the lovely wild place was not likely to become a “gardener’s
garden” it would be a wilderness of growing things before the springtime
was over.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">下午比上午更加可爱和忙碌。花园里几乎所有的杂草都被清除了，大部分的玫瑰和树木都被修剪过或者挖过了。迪肯自己带来了一把铁锹，他教会了玛丽使用她所有的工具，所以到这个时候，很明显，尽管这个可爱的荒野地方不太可能成为“园丁的花园”，但在春天结束之前，这里将会是一片长满植物的荒野。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“There’ll be apple blossoms an’ cherry blossoms
overhead,” Dickon said, working away with all his might. “An’
there’ll be peach an’ plum trees in bloom against th’ walls,
an’ th’ grass’ll be a carpet o’ flowers.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“头顶上会有苹果花和樱花,”迪肯说，竭尽全力地工作着。“墙边会有桃树和梅树盛开，草地会铺满鲜花”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
The little fox and the rook were as happy and busy as they were, and the robin
and his mate flew backward and forward like tiny streaks of lightning.
Sometimes the rook flapped his black wings and soared away over the tree-tops
in the park. Each time he came back and perched near Dickon and cawed several
times as if he were relating his adventures, and Dickon talked to him just as
he had talked to the robin. Once when Dickon was so busy that he did not answer
him at first, Soot flew on to his shoulders and gently tweaked his ear with his
large beak. When Mary wanted to rest a little Dickon sat down with her under a
tree and once he took his pipe out of his pocket and played the soft strange
little notes and two squirrels appeared on the wall and looked and listened.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">小狐狸和小车像他们一样快乐和忙碌，知更鸟和他的伴侣像微小的闪电一样前后飞行。有时候，车子拍打着黑色的翅膀，在公园的树梢上翱翔而去。每次回来，他都会在迪肯附近停下来，叫几声，好像在讲述自己的冒险经历。迪肯跟他说话，就像他跟知更鸟说话一样。有一次，迪肯太忙了，一开始没有回答他，苏特飞到他的肩膀上，用他的大嘴轻轻地拧他的耳朵。当玛丽想要休息的时候，小迪肯和她一起坐在一棵树下，有一次他从口袋里拿出烟斗，弹奏着那些柔和奇怪的小音符，两只松鼠出现在墙上，看着听着。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source">
“Tha’s a good bit stronger than tha’ was,” Dickon said,
looking at her as she was digging. “Tha’s beginning to look
different, for sure.”
</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
Mary was glowing with exercise and good spirits.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">玛丽身体健康，精神愉快，容光焕发。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“I’m getting fatter and fatter every day,” she said quite
exultantly. “Mrs. Medlock will have to get me some bigger dresses. Martha
says my hair is growing thicker. It isn’t so flat and stringy.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“我一天比一天胖,”她兴高采烈地说。梅德洛克夫人得给我买些大点的裙子。玛莎说我的头发越来越浓密了。它没有那么扁平和细密。”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
The sun was beginning to set and sending deep gold-colored rays slanting under
the trees when they parted.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">当他们分开时，太阳已经开始落山了，深金色的光线斜射在树下。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“It’ll be fine tomorrow,” said Dickon. “I’ll be
at work by sunrise.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“明天天气会好的,”迪肯说，“日出前我就能上班了。”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“So will I,” said Mary.<br><br>
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“我也是,”玛丽说。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
She ran back to the house as quickly as her feet would carry her. She wanted to
tell Colin about Dickon’s fox cub and the rook and about what the
springtime had been doing. She felt sure he would like to hear. So it was not
very pleasant when she opened the door of her room, to see Martha standing
waiting for her with a doleful face.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">她以最快的速度跑回屋里。她想告诉科林关于迪肯的狐狸幼崽和车的事，还有春天一直在做的事。她觉得他肯定想听。因此，当她打开房门，看到玛莎一脸忧郁地站在那里等她时，她感到很不愉快。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“What is the matter?” she asked. “What did Colin say when you
told him I couldn’t come?”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“怎么了?”她问道，“你告诉科林我不能来的时候他说了什么?”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“Eh!” said Martha, “I wish tha’d gone. He was nigh
goin’ into one o’ his tantrums. There’s been a nice to do all
afternoon to keep him quiet. He would watch the clock all th’
time.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“呃!”玛莎说: “我希望你已经走了。他几乎要发脾气了。整个下午都有好事让他安静下来。他会一直看着时钟。”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
Mary’s lips pinched themselves together. She was no more used to
considering other people than Colin was and she saw no reason why an
ill-tempered boy should interfere with the thing she liked best. She knew
nothing about the pitifulness of people who had been ill and nervous and who
did not know that they could control their tempers and need not make other
people ill and nervous, too. When she had had a headache in India she had done
her best to see that everybody else also had a headache or something quite as
bad. And she felt she was quite right; but of course now she felt that Colin
was quite wrong.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">玛丽的嘴唇紧紧地抿在一起。她和科林一样不习惯考虑别人，她看不出一个脾气暴躁的男孩有什么理由干涉她最喜欢的事情。她不知道那些生病和紧张的人的可怜，他们不知道他们可以控制自己的脾气，不需要让其他人也生病和紧张。当她在印度头痛的时候，她已经尽了最大努力去看到其他人也头痛或者其他相当严重的疾病。她觉得自己是对的，但是现在她当然觉得科林是错的。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
He was not on his sofa when she went into his room. He was lying flat on his
back in bed and he did not turn his head toward her as she came in. This was a
bad beginning and Mary marched up to him with her stiff manner.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">她走进他的房间时，他不在沙发上。他平躺在床上，当她进来时，他没有把头转向她。这是一个不好的开始，玛丽带着她僵硬的态度走到他面前。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“Why didn’t you get up?” she said.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“你为什么不起来?”她说。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“I did get up this morning when I thought you were coming,” he
answered, without looking at her. “I made them put me back in bed this
afternoon. My back ached and my head ached and I was tired. Why didn’t
you come?”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“今天早上我以为你要来的时候，确实起床了,”他回答，没有看她一眼。“我让他们今天下午把我放回床上。我的背疼，我的头疼，我累了。你为什么不来?”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“I was working in the garden with Dickon,” said Mary.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“我和狄肯在花园里干活,”玛丽说。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
Colin frowned and condescended to look at her.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">科林皱起眉头，居高临下地看着她。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“I won’t let that boy come here if you go and stay with him instead
of coming to talk to me,” he said.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“我不会让那个男孩来这里，如果你去和他呆在一起，而不是来跟我说话,”他说。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
Mary flew into a fine passion. She could fly into a passion without making a
noise. She just grew sour and obstinate and did not care what happened.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">玛丽激情澎湃。她可以不声不响地投入激情。她只是变得又酸又固执，不在乎发生了什么事。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“If you send Dickon away, I’ll never come into this room
again!” she retorted.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“如果你把迪肯赶走，我就再也不进这个房间了!”她反驳道。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“You’ll have to if I want you,” said Colin.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“如果我想要你，你就必须这样做,”科林说。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“I won’t!” said Mary.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“我不会的!”玛丽说。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“I’ll make you,” said Colin. “They shall drag you
in.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“我会逼你的,”科林说，“他们会把你拖进去的。”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“Shall they, Mr. Rajah!” said Mary fiercely. “They may drag
me in but they can’t make me talk when they get me here. I’ll sit
and clench my teeth and never tell you one thing. I won’t even look at
you. I’ll stare at the floor!”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“他们会的，Rajah 先生!”玛丽恶狠狠地说。“他们可能会把我拖进来，但他们不能让我说话，当他们把我带到这里。我会咬紧牙关，什么都不告诉你。我看都不会看你一眼。我会盯着地板!”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
They were a nice agreeable pair as they glared at each other. If they had been
two little street boys they would have sprung at each other and had a
rough-and-tumble fight. As it was, they did the next thing to it.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">他们是一对相处融洽的好夫妻，他们互相怒视着对方。如果他们是两个街头小混混，他们就会互相攻击，大打出手。事实上，他们做了接下来的事情。</p>

“You are a selfish thing!” cried Colin.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“你是个自私的东西!”科林喊道。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“What are you?” said Mary. “Selfish people always say that.
Anyone is selfish who doesn’t do what they want. You’re more
selfish than I am. You’re the most selfish boy I ever saw.”

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“I’m not!” snapped Colin. “I’m not as selfish as

Mary’s eyes flashed fire.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">玛丽的眼睛闪烁着火光。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“He’s nicer than any other boy that ever lived!” she said.
“He’s—he’s like an angel!” It might sound rather
silly to say that but she did not care.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“他比世上任何一个男孩都要好!”她说。“他就像天使一样!”这么说可能听起来有点傻，但她并不在乎。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“A nice angel!” Colin sneered ferociously. “He’s a
common cottage boy off the moor!”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“一个好天使!”科林恶狠狠地嘲笑道，“他只不过是荒原上一个普通的乡下男孩!”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“He’s better than a common Rajah!” retorted Mary.
“He’s a thousand times better!”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“他比一个普通的国王好多了!”玛丽反驳道。“他比一个普通的国王好一千倍!”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
Because she was the stronger of the two she was beginning to get the better of
him. The truth was that he had never had a fight with anyone like himself in
his life and, upon the whole, it was rather good for him, though neither he nor
Mary knew anything about that. He turned his head on his pillow and shut his
eyes and a big tear was squeezed out and ran down his cheek. He was beginning
to feel pathetic and sorry for himself—not for anyone else.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">因为她是两个人中较强的一个，所以她开始战胜他。事实上，他这辈子从来没有和像他这样的人吵过架，总的来说，这对他有好处，尽管他和玛丽对此一无所知。他把头靠在枕头上，闭上眼睛，一滴大泪从他的脸颊上流了下来。他开始为自己感到可悲和难过ーー不是为其他任何人。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“I’m not as selfish as you, because I’m always ill, and
I’m sure there is a lump coming on my back,” he said. “And I
am going to die besides.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">他说: “我不像你那么自私，因为我总是生病，我确信我的背上长了一个肿块。”。“而且我也要死了”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“You’re not!” contradicted Mary unsympathetically.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“你不是!”玛丽毫无同情地反驳道。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
He opened his eyes quite wide with indignation. He had never heard such a thing
said before. He was at once furious and slightly pleased, if a person could be
both at one time.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">他义愤填膺地瞪大了眼睛。他以前从未听过这样的话。如果一个人可以同时兼具两种性格，他立刻就会感到愤怒和有点高兴。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“I’m not?” he cried. “I am! You know I am! Everybody
says so.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“我不是?”他喊道。“我是! 你知道我是! 每个人都这么说。”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“I don’t believe it!” said Mary sourly. “You just say
that to make people sorry. I believe you’re proud of it. I don’t
believe it! If you were a nice boy it might be true—but you’re too
nasty!”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“我不相信!”玛丽酸溜溜地说。你这么说只是为了让人们后悔。我相信你为此感到骄傲。真不敢相信！如果你是个好孩子，这可能是真的，但是你太坏了!”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
In spite of his invalid back Colin sat up in bed in quite a healthy rage.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">尽管科林的背部有些残疾，他还是在床上坐了起来，心里非常生气。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“Get out of the room!” he shouted and he caught hold of his pillow
and threw it at her. He was not strong enough to throw it far and it only fell
at her feet, but Mary’s face looked as pinched as a nutcracker.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“滚出房间!”他大叫着抓住枕头朝她扔过去。他没有力气把它扔远，它只是掉在玛丽的脚下，但是玛丽的脸看起来像胡桃夹子一样紧绷。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“I’m going,” she said. “And I won’t come
back!”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“我要走了,”她说，“我不会再回来了!”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
She walked to the door and when she reached it she turned round and spoke
again.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">她走到门口，当她走到门口时，她又转过身来说话。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“I was going to tell you all sorts of nice things,” she said.
“Dickon brought his fox and his rook and I was going to tell you all
about them. Now I won’t tell you a single thing!”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“我打算告诉你各种各样的好事,”她说。“迪肯带来了他的狐狸和车，我打算告诉你关于他们的一切。现在我什么都不会告诉你了!”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
She marched out of the door and closed it behind her, and there to her great
astonishment she found the trained nurse standing as if she had been listening
and, more amazing still—she was laughing. She was a big handsome young
woman who ought not to have been a trained nurse at all, as she could not bear
invalids and she was always making excuses to leave Colin to Martha or anyone
else who would take her place. Mary had never liked her, and she simply stood
and gazed up at her as she stood giggling into her handkerchief..
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">她大步走出门，在身后把门关上，她惊讶地发现那个训练有素的护士站在那里，好像她一直在听，更令人惊讶的是，她还在笑。她是一个高大英俊的年轻女子，根本不应该是一个受过训练的护士，因为她无法忍受残疾人，她总是找借口把科林留给玛莎或任何其他人来接替她的位置。玛丽从来没有喜欢过她，她只是站着，凝视着她，而她站在那里对着手帕傻笑。.</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“What are you laughing at?” she asked her.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“你在笑什么?”她问她。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“At you two young ones,” said the nurse. “It’s the best
thing that could happen to the sickly pampered thing to have someone to stand
up to him that’s as spoiled as himself;” and she laughed into her
handkerchief again. “If he’d had a young vixen of a sister to fight
with it would have been the saving of him.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“你们两个年轻人,”护士说。“对这个病态的娇生惯养的人来说，能有一个像他自己一样被宠坏的人站出来反抗他是最好的事情了;”她又对着手帕笑了起来。“如果他有一个年轻的狐狸精妹妹与之战斗，这将是他的救赎。”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“Is he going to die?”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“他会死吗?”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“I don’t know and I don’t care,” said the nurse.
“Hysterics and temper are half what ails him.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“我不知道，我也不在乎,”护士说，“歇斯底里和脾气是他病的一半原因。”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“What are hysterics?” asked Mary.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“什么是歇斯底里?”玛丽问。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“You’ll find out if you work him into a tantrum after
this—but at any rate you’ve given him something to have hysterics
about, and I’m glad of it.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“在这之后，你会发现，如果你让他发脾气，他会怎么做? 但无论如何，你给了他一些歇斯底里的理由，我很高兴。”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
Mary went back to her room not feeling at all as she had felt when she had come
in from the garden. She was cross and disappointed but not at all sorry for
Colin. She had looked forward to telling him a great many things and she had
meant to try to make up her mind whether it would be safe to trust him with the
great secret. She had been beginning to think it would be, but now she had
changed her mind entirely. She would never tell him and he could stay in his
room and never get any fresh air and die if he liked! It would serve him right!
She felt so sour and unrelenting that for a few minutes she almost forgot about
Dickon and the green veil creeping over the world and the soft wind blowing
down from the moor.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">玛丽回到自己的房间，感觉一点也不像她从花园里回来时的感觉。她很生气，很失望，但一点也不为科林感到难过。她期待着告诉他许多事情，她打算试着下定决心，把这个大秘密托付给他是否安全。她原本以为会这样，但现在她完全改变了主意。她永远不会告诉他，他可以呆在自己的房间里，永远不呼吸新鲜空气，如果他愿意，就死去吧！他活该！她感到如此酸涩和无情，以至于有那么几分钟她几乎忘记了狄肯，忘记了绿色的面纱在世界上蔓延，忘记了从沼地吹来的轻柔的风。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
Martha was waiting for her and the trouble in her face had been temporarily
replaced by interest and curiosity. There was a wooden box on the table and its
cover had been removed and revealed that it was full of neat packages.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">玛莎正在等她，她脸上的烦恼暂时被兴趣和好奇心所取代。桌子上有一个木箱子，盖子已经拆开了，里面装满了整齐的包裹。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“Mr. Craven sent it to you,” said Martha. “It looks as if it
had picture-books in it.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“克雷文先生寄给你的,”玛莎说，“看起来好像里面有图画书。”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
Mary remembered what he had asked her the day she had gone to his room.
“Do you want anything—dolls—toys—books?” She
opened the package wondering if he had sent a doll, and also wondering what she
should do with it if he had. But he had not sent one. There were several
beautiful books such as Colin had, and two of them were about gardens and were
full of pictures. There were two or three games and there was a beautiful
little writing-case with a gold monogram on it and a gold pen and inkstand.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">玛丽记得她去他房间那天他问她的话。“你想要什么东西ーー娃娃ーー玩具ーー书吗?”她打开包裹，想知道他是否寄来了一个娃娃，也想知道如果他寄来了，她该怎么办。但是他没有寄出一封。有几本像科林那样漂亮的书，其中有两本是关于花园的，里面全是图画。那里有两三个游戏，还有一个漂亮的小文具盒，上面有一个金色的字母组合，还有一支金色的钢笔和墨水瓶。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
Everything was so nice that her pleasure began to crowd her anger out of her
mind. She had not expected him to remember her at all and her hard little heart
grew quite warm.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">一切都是那么美好，以至于她的快乐开始把她的愤怒挤出她的脑海。她完全没有想到他会记得她，她那颗坚硬的小心脏变得相当温暖。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“I can write better than I can print,” she said, “and the
first thing I shall write with that pen will be a letter to tell him I am much
obliged.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“我写的比印的好,”她说，“我用那支笔写的第一件事就是写一封信告诉他我非常感激。”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
If she had been friends with Colin she would have run to show him her presents
at once, and they would have looked at the pictures and read some of the
gardening books and perhaps tried playing the games, and he would have enjoyed
himself so much he would never once have thought he was going to die or have
put his hand on his spine to see if there was a lump coming. He had a way of
doing that which she could not bear. It gave her an uncomfortable frightened
feeling because he always looked so frightened himself. He said that if he felt
even quite a little lump some day he should know his hunch had begun to grow.
Something he had heard Mrs. Medlock whispering to the nurse had given him the
idea and he had thought over it in secret until it was quite firmly fixed in
his mind. Mrs. Medlock had said his father’s back had begun to show its
crookedness in that way when he was a child. He had never told anyone but Mary
that most of his “tantrums” as they called them grew out of his
hysterical hidden fear. Mary had been sorry for him when he had told her.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">如果她是科林的朋友，她会立刻跑过去给他看她的礼物，他们会看图片，读一些园艺书籍，也许还会试着玩游戏，他会玩得非常开心，以至于他从来没有想过自己会死，也没有把手放在脊柱上看是否有肿块。他有一种她无法忍受的做事方式。这使她感到一种不舒服的害怕的感觉，因为他自己看起来总是那么害怕。他说，如果有一天他觉得哪怕是一个小肿块，他就应该知道他的预感已经开始增强了。他听到梅德洛克太太对护士低声说的一些话，使他产生了这个想法，他暗暗地想了一会儿，直到把这个想法牢牢地记在心里。梅德洛克太太说，他父亲小时候的背就开始这样弯曲了。除了玛丽，他从来没有告诉过任何人他的大部分“发脾气”都是由于他歇斯底里的隐藏的恐惧。当他告诉玛丽时，她为他感到难过。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“He always began to think about it when he was cross or tired,” she
said to herself. “And he has been cross today. Perhaps—perhaps he
has been thinking about it all afternoon.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“当他生气或累了的时候，他总是开始想这件事,”她对自己说。他今天很生气。也许ーー也许他整个下午都在考虑这件事。”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
She stood still, looking down at the carpet and thinking.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">她一动不动地站着，低头看着地毯，心里想着。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“I said I would never go back again—” she hesitated, knitting
her brows—“but perhaps, just perhaps, I will go and see—if he
wants me—in the morning. Perhaps he’ll try to throw his pillow at
me again, but—I think—I’ll go.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“我说过我再也不会回去了ーー”她犹豫了一下，皱起了眉头ーー“但是也许，只是也许，我会去看看ーー如果他想要我ーー明天早上。也许他会试着再向我扔枕头，但ーー我想ーー我会去的。”</p>

A TANTRUM<font class="cyxy-trs-target"> 发脾气</font></h2>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
She had got up very early in the morning and had worked hard in the garden and
she was tired and sleepy, so as soon as Martha had brought her supper and she
had eaten it, she was glad to go to bed. As she laid her head on the pillow she
murmured to herself:
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">她早上起得很早，在花园里辛苦劳作，又累又困，所以当玛莎给她送来晚餐并吃完后，她很高兴地上床睡觉了。她把头枕在枕头上，自言自语道:</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“I’ll go out before breakfast and work with Dickon and then
afterward—I believe—I’ll go to see him.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“我会在早餐前出去，和迪肯一起工作，然后ーー我相信ーー我会去看他。”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
She thought it was the middle of the night when she was awakened by such
dreadful sounds that she jumped out of bed in an instant. What was
it—what was it? The next minute she felt quite sure she knew. Doors were
opened and shut and there were hurrying feet in the corridors and someone was
crying and screaming at the same time, screaming and crying in a horrible way.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">她以为已经是半夜了，突然被可怕的声音惊醒，一下子从床上跳了起来。是什么，是什么？下一分钟，她觉得自己肯定知道了。门被打开又关上，走廊里有急匆匆的脚，有人一边哭一边尖叫，哭得很可怕。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“It’s Colin,” she said. “He’s having one of those
tantrums the nurse called hysterics. How awful it sounds.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“是科林,”她说。“他正在发脾气，护士称之为歇斯底里。听起来真可怕。”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
As she listened to the sobbing screams she did not wonder that people were so
frightened that they gave him his own way in everything rather than hear them.
She put her hands over her ears and felt sick and shivering.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">当她听到哭泣的尖叫声时，她并不奇怪人们是如此的害怕，以至于他们在任何事情上都给了他自己的方式，而不是听到他们的声音。她用手捂住耳朵，感到恶心和发抖。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“I don’t know what to do. I don’t know what to do,” she
kept saying. “I can’t bear it.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“我不知道该怎么办。我不知道该怎么办,”她不停地说。“我受不了了。”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
Once she wondered if he would stop if she dared go to him and then she
remembered how he had driven her out of the room and thought that perhaps the
sight of her might make him worse. Even when she pressed her hands more tightly
over her ears she could not keep the awful sounds out. She hated them so and
was so terrified by them that suddenly they began to make her angry and she
felt as if she should like to fly into a tantrum herself and frighten him as he
was frightening her. She was not used to anyone’s tempers but her own.
She took her hands from her ears and sprang up and stamped her foot.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">有一次她想，如果她敢去找他，他会不会停下来，然后她想起他是怎么把她赶出房间的，她想，也许看到她会让他更糟糕。即使当她把双手更紧地按在耳朵上时，她也无法把那可怕的声音挡在外面。她如此憎恨他们，如此害怕他们，以至于他们突然开始让她生气，她觉得自己好像要发脾气，像他吓唬她一样吓唬他。除了她自己的脾气，她不习惯任何人的脾气。她把手从耳朵上拿开，跳起来跺了跺脚。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“He ought to be stopped! Somebody ought to make him stop! Somebody ought
to beat him!” she cried out.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“应该有人阻止他! 应该有人阻止他! 应该有人打他!”她喊道。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
Just then she heard feet almost running down the corridor and her door opened
and the nurse came in. She was not laughing now by any means. She even looked
rather pale.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">就在这时，她听到脚步声几乎跑过走廊，她的门打开了，护士走了进来。她现在无论如何也笑不出来了。她甚至看起来脸色苍白。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“He’s worked himself into hysterics,” she said in a great
hurry. “He’ll do himself harm. No one can do anything with him. You
come and try, like a good child. He likes you.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“他把自己搞得歇斯底里,”她急忙说。他会伤害自己。没人能对他做什么。你来试试，像个乖孩子。他喜欢你”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source">
“He turned me out of the room this morning,” said Mary, stamping
her foot with excitement.
</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source">
The stamp rather pleased the nurse. The truth was that she had been afraid she
might find Mary crying and hiding her head under the bed-clothes.
</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source">
“That’s right,” she said. “You’re in the right
humor. You go and scold him. Give him something new to think of. Do go, child,
as quick as ever you can.”
</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
It was not until afterward that Mary realized that the thing had been funny as
well as dreadful—that it was funny that all the grown-up people were so
frightened that they came to a little girl just because they guessed she was
almost as bad as Colin himself.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">直到后来，玛丽才意识到这件事既有趣又可怕ーー有趣的是，所有的成年人都如此害怕，以至于他们来找一个小女孩，仅仅因为他们猜测她几乎和科林本人一样坏。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
She flew along the corridor and the nearer she got to the screams the higher
her temper mounted. She felt quite wicked by the time she reached the door. She
slapped it open with her hand and ran across the room to the four-posted bed.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">她沿着走廊飞奔，离尖叫声越近，她的脾气就越大。当她走到门口的时候，她觉得自己很邪恶。她用手一拍打开它，跑到房间另一头那张有四根柱子的床上。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“You stop!” she almost shouted. “You stop! I hate you!
Everybody hates you! I wish everybody would run out of the house and let you
scream yourself to death! You <i>will</i> scream yourself to death in a minute,
and I wish you would!”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“你住手!”她差点就喊出来了。“你住手！我恨你！大家都讨厌你！我希望所有人都跑出去让你尖叫到死！你会在一分钟内尖叫致死，我希望你这么做!”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
A nice sympathetic child could neither have thought nor said such things, but
it just happened that the shock of hearing them was the best possible thing for
this hysterical boy whom no one had ever dared to restrain or contradict.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">一个富有同情心的好孩子不可能想到也不可能说出这样的话，但是碰巧听到这些话时的震惊对这个歇斯底里的男孩来说是最好的事情，没有人敢约束或反驳他。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
He had been lying on his face beating his pillow with his hands and he actually
almost jumped around, he turned so quickly at the sound of the furious little
voice. His face looked dreadful, white and red and swollen, and he was gasping
and choking; but savage little Mary did not care an atom.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">他一直趴在地上用手敲打枕头，实际上他差点跳起来，听到那愤怒的小声音，他很快转过身来。他的脸看起来很可怕，又白又红又肿，喘着粗气，哽咽着; 但是野蛮的小玛丽一点也不在乎。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source">
“If you scream another scream,” she said, “I’ll scream
too—and I can scream louder than you can and I’ll frighten you,
I’ll frighten you!”
</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
He actually had stopped screaming because she had startled him so. The scream
which had been coming almost choked him. The tears were streaming down his face
and he shook all over.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">他实际上已经不再尖叫了，因为她吓到他了。一直传来的尖叫声几乎使他窒息。泪水顺着他的脸颊流下来，他浑身发抖。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source">
“I can’t stop!” he gasped and sobbed. “I
can’t—I can’t!”
</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source">
“You can!” shouted Mary. “Half that ails you is hysterics and
temper—just hysterics—hysterics—hysterics!” and she
stamped each time she said it.
</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“I felt the lump—I felt it,” choked out Colin. “I knew
I should. I shall have a hunch on my back and then I shall die,” and he
began to writhe again and turned on his face and sobbed and wailed but he
didn’t scream.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“我感觉到肿块了，我感觉到了,”科林哽咽着说。我知道我应该。我的背上会有一个预感，然后我就会死去,”他又开始扭动身体，转过脸来，抽泣着，哭泣着，但是他没有尖叫。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“You didn’t feel a lump!” contradicted Mary fiercely.
“If you did it was only a hysterical lump. Hysterics makes lumps.
There’s nothing the matter with your horrid back—nothing but
hysterics! Turn over and let me look at it!”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“你没有感觉到肿块!”玛丽激烈地反驳。“如果你这样做，它只是一个歇斯底里的肿块。歇斯底里会让人结块。你那可怕的背没什么问题只是有点歇斯底里！转过来让我看看!”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source">
She liked the word “hysterics” and felt somehow as if it had an
effect on him. He was probably like herself and had never heard it before.
</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source">
“Nurse,” she commanded, “come here and show me his back this
minute!”
</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
The nurse, Mrs. Medlock and Martha had been standing huddled together near the
door staring at her, their mouths half open. All three had gasped with fright
more than once. The nurse came forward as if she were half afraid. Colin was
heaving with great breathless sobs.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">护士、梅德洛克太太和玛莎一直挤在门边，半张着嘴盯着她。这三个人都不止一次被吓得倒抽了一口冷气。护士走上前来，好像有点害怕。科林气喘吁吁地抽泣着。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source">
“Perhaps he—he won’t let me,” she hesitated in a low
voice.
</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source">
Colin heard her, however, and he gasped out between two sobs:
</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“Sh-show her! She-she’ll see then!”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“给她看，她会看到的”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
It was a poor thin back to look at when it was bared. Every rib could be
counted and every joint of the spine, though Mistress Mary did not count them
as she bent over and examined them with a solemn savage little face. She looked
so sour and old-fashioned that the nurse turned her head aside to hide the
twitching of her mouth. There was just a minute’s silence, for even Colin

up, as intently as if she had been the great doctor from London.

“There’s not a single lump there!” she said at last.
“There’s not a lump as big as a pin—except backbone lumps,
and you can only feel them because you’re thin. I’ve got backbone
lumps myself, and they used to stick out as much as yours do, until I began to
get fatter, and I am not fat enough yet to hide them. There’s not a lump
as big as a pin! If you ever say there is again, I shall laugh!”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“那里没有一个肿块!”她最后说。“没有一个肿块像大头针那么大ーー除了脊柱上的肿块，你只能感觉到它们，因为你很瘦。我自己也有脊椎肿块，它们曾经和你的一样突出，直到我开始变胖，我还没有胖到可以把它们藏起来。没有一个像针一样大的肿块！如果你再说有，我会笑的!”</p>

No one but Colin himself knew what effect those crossly spoken childish words
had on him. If he had ever had anyone to talk to about his secret
terrors—if he had ever dared to let himself ask questions—if he had
had childish companions and had not lain on his back in the huge closed house,
breathing an atmosphere heavy with the fears of people who were most of them
ignorant and tired of him, he would have found out that most of his fright and
illness was created by himself. But he had lain and thought of himself and his
aches and weariness for hours and days and months and years. And now that an
angry unsympathetic little girl insisted obstinately that he was not as ill as
he thought he was he actually felt as if she might be speaking the truth.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">除了科林自己，没有人知道这些孩子气的话对他有什么影响。如果他曾经有过任何人可以谈论他的秘密恐惧ーー如果他曾经敢于让自己问问题ーー如果他曾经有过孩子气的同伴，如果他没有躺在封闭的大房子里，呼吸着一种充满恐惧的气氛，那些人大多数对他一无所知，厌倦了他，他会发现他的大部分恐惧和疾病都是他自己造成的。但是他躺在那里，想着他自己，想着他的疼痛和疲倦，想了好几个小时，好几天，好几个月，好几年。现在，一个愤怒的、冷漠无情的小女孩固执地坚持说，他没有他自以为的那么病，他实际上觉得她可能说的是实话。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“I didn’t know,” ventured the nurse, “that he thought
he had a lump on his spine. His back is weak because he won’t try to sit
up. I could have told him there was no lump there.” Colin gulped and
turned his face a little to look at her.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“我不知道,”护士大胆地说，“他以为他的脊椎上长了个肿块。他的背很虚弱，因为他不想坐起来。我本可以告诉他那里没有肿块。”科林咽了一口唾沫，转过脸来看着她。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“C-could you?” he said pathetically.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“你能吗?”他可怜兮兮地说。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“Yes, sir.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“是的，先生。”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source">
“There!” said Mary, and she gulped too.
</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
Colin turned on his face again and but for his long-drawn broken breaths, which
were the dying down of his storm of sobbing, he lay still for a minute, though
great tears streamed down his face and wet the pillow. Actually the tears meant
that a curious great relief had come to him. Presently he turned and looked at
the nurse again and strangely enough he was not like a Rajah at all as he spoke
to her.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">科林又转过脸来，除了长时间的断断续续的呼吸——那是他的抽泣暴风雨的结束——他静静地躺了一分钟，尽管巨大的泪水从他的脸上流下来，打湿了枕头。事实上，眼泪意味着一种奇怪的巨大的解脱已经降临到他身上。过了一会儿，他又转过头来看着护士，奇怪的是，他跟她说话的时候一点也不像个国王。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source">
“Do you think—I could—live to grow up?” he said.
</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source">
The nurse was neither clever nor soft-hearted but she could repeat some of the
London doctor’s words.
</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source">
“You probably will if you will do what you are told to do and not give
way to your temper, and stay out a great deal in the fresh air.”
</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
Colin’s tantrum had passed and he was weak and worn out with crying and
this perhaps made him feel gentle. He put out his hand a little toward Mary,
and I am glad to say that, her own tantum having passed, she was softened too
and met him half-way with her hand, so that it was a sort of making up.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">科林的脾气已经过去了，他很虚弱，哭得筋疲力尽，这也许使他感到温柔。他向玛丽伸出了一只手，我很高兴地说，她自己的愤怒已经过去了，她也变得柔和了，她的手在半路上碰到了他，所以这算是一种和解。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“I’ll—I’ll go out with you, Mary,” he said.
“I shan’t hate fresh air if we can find—” He remembered
just in time to stop himself from saying “if we can find the secret
garden” and he ended, “I shall like to go out with you if Dickon
will come and push my chair. I do so want to see Dickon and the fox and the
crow.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“我要——我要和你出去，玛丽,”他说。“如果我们能找到新鲜空气，我就不会讨厌了ーー”他及时想起来，不再说“如果我们能找到秘密花园”，最后说，“如果迪肯能来推我的椅子，我愿意和你一起出去。我真的很想看迪肯，狐狸和乌鸦</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
The nurse remade the tumbled bed and shook and straightened the pillows. Then
she made Colin a cup of beef tea and gave a cup to Mary, who really was very
glad to get it after her excitement. Mrs. Medlock and Martha gladly slipped
away, and after everything was neat and calm and in order the nurse looked as
if she would very gladly slip away also. She was a healthy young woman who
resented being robbed of her sleep and she yawned quite openly as she looked at
Mary, who had pushed her big footstool close to the four-posted bed and was
holding Colin’s hand.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">护士把翻倒的床重新铺好，摇晃并整理了枕头。然后她给科林泡了一杯牛肉茶，又给了玛丽一杯，玛丽真的很高兴在她兴奋之后得到了它。梅德洛克太太和玛莎很高兴地溜走了，等一切都安排好了，护士看起来也很高兴地溜走了。她是一个健康的年轻女人，很讨厌别人剥夺她的睡眠，当她看着玛丽的时候，她打了个哈欠，玛丽把她的大脚凳推到四柱床边，握着科林的手。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source">
“You must go back and get your sleep out,” she said.
“He’ll drop off after a while—if he’s not too upset.
Then I’ll lie down myself in the next room.”
</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source">
“Would you like me to sing you that song I learned from my Ayah?”
Mary whispered to Colin.
</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source">
His hand pulled hers gently and he turned his tired eyes on her appealingly.
</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source">
“Oh, yes!” he answered. “It’s such a soft song. I shall
go to sleep in a minute.”
</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source">
“I will put him to sleep,” Mary said to the yawning nurse.
“You can go if you like.”
</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source">
“Well,” said the nurse, with an attempt at reluctance. “If he
doesn’t go to sleep in half an hour you must call me.”
</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“Very well,” answered Mary.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“很好,”玛丽回答。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source">
The nurse was out of the room in a minute and as soon as she was gone Colin
pulled Mary’s hand again.
</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“I almost told,” he said; “but I stopped myself in time. I
won’t talk and I’ll go to sleep, but you said you had a whole lot
of nice things to tell me. Have you—do you think you have found out
anything at all about the way into the secret garden?”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“我差点就说出来了,”他说，“但我及时制止了自己。我不会说话，我会睡觉，但你说你有很多好事要告诉我。你有没有... 你有没有发现进入秘密花园的任何线索?”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source">
Mary looked at his poor little tired face and swollen eyes and her heart
relented.
</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source">
“Ye-es,” she answered, “I think I have. And if you will go to
sleep I will tell you tomorrow.” His hand quite trembled.
</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“Oh, Mary!” he said. “Oh, Mary! If I could get into it I
think I should live to grow up! Do you suppose that instead of singing the Ayah
song—you could just tell me softly as you did that first day what you
imagine it looks like inside? I am sure it will make me go to sleep.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“哦，玛丽!”他说。“噢，玛丽！如果我能进入它，我想我应该活着长大！你认为你可以像第一天那样轻轻地告诉我，你想象中的内心是什么样子，而不是唱阿亚之歌吗？我肯定它会让我睡着的。”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“Yes,” answered Mary. “Shut your eyes.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“是的,”玛丽回答，“闭上你的眼睛。”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source">
He closed his eyes and lay quite still and she held his hand and began to speak
very slowly and in a very low voice.
</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“I think it has been left alone so long—that it has grown all into
a lovely tangle. I think the roses have climbed and climbed and climbed until
they hang from the branches and walls and creep over the ground—almost
like a strange gray mist. Some of them have died but many—are alive and
when the summer comes there will be curtains and fountains of roses. I think
the ground is full of daffodils and snowdrops and lilies and iris working their
way out of the dark. Now the spring has
begun—perhaps—perhaps—”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“我认为它已经被孤立太久了ーー以至于它已经变成了一个可爱的纠结。我想这些玫瑰一直爬啊爬，直到它们挂在树枝和墙上，爬过地面ーー几乎像一团奇怪的灰色雾气。他们中的一些人已经死了，但是很多人ーー还活着，当夏天来临的时候，那里将会有窗帘和玫瑰花的喷泉。我觉得地上到处都是水仙花，雪花莲，百合花和鸢尾花在黑暗中生长。现在春天已经开始ーー也许ーー也许ーー”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source">
The soft drone of her voice was making him stiller and stiller and she saw it
and went on.
</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“Perhaps they are coming up through the grass—perhaps there are
clusters of purple crocuses and gold ones—even now. Perhaps the leaves
are beginning to break out and uncurl—and perhaps—the gray is
changing and a green gauze veil is creeping—and creeping
over—everything. And the birds are coming to look at it—because it
is—so safe and still. And
perhaps—perhaps—perhaps—” very softly and slowly
indeed, “the robin has found a mate—and is building a nest.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“也许它们是从草丛中冒出来的ーー也许是一簇簇的紫番红花和金色的番红花ーー即使是现在。也许是树叶开始长出来，展开了ーー也许是ーー灰色正在发生变化，一层绿色的纱布正在悄悄地爬过ーー所有的东西。鸟儿们来看它，因为它是如此安全和宁静。“也许，也许，也许”确实非常轻柔缓慢地说，“知更鸟找到了配偶，正在筑巢。”</p>

Of course Mary did not waken early the next morning. She slept late because she
was tired, and when Martha brought her breakfast she told her that though
Colin was quite quiet he was ill and feverish as he always was after he had
worn himself out with a fit of crying. Mary ate her breakfast slowly as she
listened.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">第二天早上玛丽当然没有早起。她睡得很晚是因为她累了，当玛莎给她送早餐的时候，她告诉她，科林虽然很安静，但是在一阵哭闹把自己弄得筋疲力尽之后，他还是像往常一样生病发烧。玛丽一边听一边慢慢地吃早餐。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“He says he wishes tha’ would please go and see him as soon as
tha’ can,” Martha said. “It’s queer what a fancy
he’s took to thee. Tha’ did give it him last night for
sure—didn’t tha? Nobody else would have dared to do it. Eh! poor
lad! He’s been spoiled till salt won’t save him. Mother says as
th’ two worst things as can happen to a child is never to have his own
way—or always to have it. She doesn’t know which is th’
worst. Tha’ was in a fine temper tha’self, too. But he says to me
when I went into his room, ‘Please ask Miss Mary if she’ll please
come an’ talk to me?’ Think o’ him saying please! Will you
go, Miss?”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“他说他希望你能尽快去看看他,”玛莎说。”他对你的幻想真奇怪。你昨晚确实给他了，不是吗？没有其他人敢这么做。呃！可怜的孩子！他被宠坏了，盐也救不了他。母亲说，对孩子来说，最糟糕的两件事就是永远不能按自己的方式行事ーー或者永远不能按自己的方式行事。她不知道哪个更糟。你的脾气也很好。但当我走进他的房间时，他对我说: “请问玛丽小姐是否愿意来和我谈谈?”想想他说请！你会去吗，小姐?”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source">
“I’ll run and see Dickon first,” said Mary. “No,
I’ll go and see Colin first and tell him—I know what I’ll
tell him,” with a sudden inspiration.
</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
She had her hat on when she appeared in Colin’s room and for a second he
looked disappointed. He was in bed. His face was pitifully white and there were
dark circles round his eyes.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">她戴着帽子出现在科林的房间里，有那么一瞬间他看起来很失望。他在床上。他的脸白得可怜，眼睛周围有黑眼圈。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source">
“I’m glad you came,” he said. “My head aches and I ache
all over because I’m so tired. Are you going somewhere?”
</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source">
Mary went and leaned against his bed.
</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source">
“I won’t be long,” she said. “I’m going to
Dickon, but I’ll come back. Colin, it’s—it’s something
about the garden.”
</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source">
His whole face brightened and a little color came into it.
</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“Oh! is it?” he cried out. “I dreamed about it all night. I
heard you say something about gray changing into green, and I dreamed I was
standing in a place all filled with trembling little green leaves—and
there were birds on nests everywhere and they looked so soft and still.
I’ll lie and think about it until you come back.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“哦！是吗?”他喊道。”我整晚都在梦里。我听到你说什么灰色变成绿色，我梦见我站在一个地方，到处都是颤抖的小绿叶ーー到处都是鸟巢，它们看起来那么柔软和安静。我会撒谎，好好想想，直到你回来”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source">
In five minutes Mary was with Dickon in their garden. The fox and the crow were
with him again and this time he had brought two tame squirrels.
</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“I came over on the pony this mornin’,” he said. “Eh!
he is a good little chap—Jump is! I brought these two in my pockets. This
here one he’s called Nut an’ this here other one’s called
Shell.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“我今天早上骑着小马过来的,”他说。“呃！他是个好小伙子，跳吧！我把这两个放在口袋里。这个叫坚果，这个叫贝壳</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source">
When he said “Nut” one squirrel leaped on to his right shoulder and
when he said “Shell” the other one leaped on to his left shoulder.
</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
When they sat down on the grass with Captain curled at their feet, Soot
solemnly listening on a tree and Nut and Shell nosing about close to them, it
seemed to Mary that it would be scarcely bearable to leave such delightfulness,
but when she began to tell her story somehow the look in Dickon’s funny
face gradually changed her mind. She could see he felt sorrier for Colin than
she did. He looked up at the sky and all about him.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">当他们坐在草地上，船长蜷缩在他们的脚边，苏特严肃地听着树上的声音，坚果和贝壳在他们身边嗅来嗅去，玛丽似乎很难忍受留下这样的快乐，但是当她开始讲述她的故事时，不知怎么的，迪肯那滑稽的脸上的表情逐渐改变了她的想法。她看得出他比她更同情科林。他抬头看着天空和周围的一切。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“Just listen to them birds—th’ world seems full of
’em—all whistlin’ an’ pipin’,” he said.
“Look at ’em dartin’ about, an’ hearken at ’em
callin’ to each other. Come springtime seems like as if all th’
world’s callin’. The leaves is uncurlin’ so you can see
’em—an’, my word, th’ nice smells there is
about!” sniffing with his happy turned-up nose. “An’ that
poor lad lyin’ shut up an’ seein’ so little that he gets to
thinkin’ o’ things as sets him screamin’. Eh! my! we mun get
him out here—we mun get him watchin’ an listenin’ an’

sunshine. An’ we munnot lose no time about it.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">他说: “听听这些鸟儿的叫声吧，这个世界似乎到处都是它们，它们都在吹口哨和吹笛子。”。看着他们四处乱窜，听着他们互相呼唤。春天来了，似乎整个世界都在召唤。树叶松开了，所以你可以看到它们，而且，我的天，那里有很好闻的气味!”用他高兴地翘起的鼻子嗅着。“那个可怜的孩子躺在那里，什么也看不见，只能想着一些让他尖叫的事情。呃！我的天！我们得把他弄出来我们得让他看看，听听，闻闻空气让他沐浴在阳光下。我们不能浪费时间</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
When he was very much interested he often spoke quite broad Yorkshire though at
other times he tried to modify his dialect so that Mary could better
understand. But she loved his broad Yorkshire and had in fact been trying to
learn to speak it herself. So she spoke a little now.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">当他非常感兴趣的时候，他经常说相当广泛的约克郡话，尽管在其他时候他试图修改他的方言，以便玛丽能够更好地理解。但是她喜欢他广阔的约克郡，事实上她一直在努力学习自己说约克郡语。所以她现在开口说话了。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“Aye, that we mun,” she said (which meant “Yes, indeed, we
must”). “I’ll tell thee what us’ll do first,” she
proceeded, and Dickon grinned, because when the little wench tried to twist her
tongue into speaking Yorkshire it amused him very much. “He’s took
a graidely fancy to thee. He wants to see thee and he wants to see Soot
an’ Captain. When I go back to the house to talk to him I’ll ax him
if tha’ canna’ come an’ see him tomorrow
mornin’—an’ bring tha’ creatures wi’
thee—an’ then—in a bit, when there’s more leaves out,
an’ happen a bud or two, we’ll get him to come out an’
tha’ shall push him in his chair an’ we’ll bring him here
an’ show him everything.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“是的，我们必须这样做,”她说(意思是“是的，我们必须这样做”)。“我来告诉你，我们首先要做什么,”她接着说，迪肯咧嘴一笑，因为当这个小姑娘试图用舌头说约克郡话时，他觉得很有趣。”他渐渐地喜欢上了你。他想见你，他想见 Soot 和船长。如果你明天早上不能来看他，我就用斧头砍他，然后带上你的小动物，再过一会儿，叶子再长出来，再长出一两个花苞，我们就把他弄出来，你把他推到椅子上，我们就把他带到这儿来，让他看看一切。”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source">
When she stopped she was quite proud of herself. She had never made a long
speech in Yorkshire before and she had remembered very well.
</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“Tha’ mun talk a bit o’ Yorkshire like that to Mester
Colin,” Dickon chuckled. “Tha’ll make him laugh an’
there’s nowt as good for ill folk as laughin’ is. Mother says she
believes as half a hour’s good laugh every mornin’ ’ud cure a
chap as was makin’ ready for typhus fever.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“你对科林先生说约克郡的话有点像那样,”迪肯咯咯地笑着说。“那会让他笑的，对病人来说笑是最好的”。妈妈说，她相信每天早上半个小时的大笑就能治好一个小伙子，就像他在为斑疹伤寒做准备一样。”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source">
“I’m going to talk Yorkshire to him this very day,” said
Mary, chuckling herself.
</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
The garden had reached the time when every day and every night it seemed as if
Magicians were passing through it drawing loveliness out of the earth and the
boughs with wands. It was hard to go away and leave it all, particularly as Nut
had actually crept on to her dress and Shell had scrambled down the trunk of
the apple-tree they sat under and stayed there looking at her with inquiring
eyes. But she went back to the house and when she sat down close to
Colin’s bed he began to sniff as Dickon did though not in such an
experienced way.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">花园已经到了每日每夜似乎都有魔法师经过的时候了，他们用魔杖从大地和树枝中汲取着可爱的气息。要离开这一切真的很难，尤其是当坚果爬上她的裙子，壳牌爬下他们坐的苹果树的树干，用询问的眼神呆在那里看着她的时候。但是她回到房子里，当她在科林的床边坐下时，他开始像迪肯那样嗅了起来，尽管没有那么有经验。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source">
“You smell like flowers and—and fresh things,” he cried out
quite joyously. “What is it you smell of? It’s cool and warm and
sweet all at the same time.”
</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“It’s th’ wind from th’ moor,” said Mary.
“It comes o’ sittin’ on th’ grass under a tree

an’ sunshine as smells so graidely.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“是沼泽地的风,”玛丽说。“它来自于和迪肯，船长，烟灰，坚果和贝壳一起坐在树下的草地上”。现在是春天，户外阳光明媚，空气清新宜人。”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source">
She said it as broadly as she could, and you do not know how broadly Yorkshire
sounds until you have heard someone speak it. Colin began to laugh.
</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source">
“What are you doing?” he said. “I never heard you talk like
that before. How funny it sounds.”
</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“I’m givin’ thee a bit o’ Yorkshire,” answered
Mary triumphantly. “I canna’ talk as graidely as Dickon an’
Martha can but tha’ sees I can shape a bit. Doesn’t tha’

tha’ a Yorkshire lad thysel’ bred an’ born! Eh! I wonder

</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“我要给你一点约克郡葡萄酒,”玛丽得意洋洋地回答。“我不能像迪肯和玛莎那样慢条斯理地说话，但是你看我可以稍微塑造一下自己。你难道听不懂约克郡人的话吗？你生了一个约克郡小伙子！呃！我不知道你是否为你的脸感到羞耻</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
And then she began to laugh too and they both laughed until they could not stop
themselves and they laughed until the room echoed and Mrs. Medlock opening the
door to come in drew back into the corridor and stood listening amazed.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">然后她也开始笑了起来，他们俩都笑得停不下来，他们一直笑到房间里回响起来，梅德洛克夫人打开门走了进来，退回到走廊里，惊奇地站在那里听着。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“Well, upon my word!” she said, speaking rather broad Yorkshire
herself because there was no one to hear her and she was so astonished.
“Whoever heard th’ like! Whoever on earth would ha’ thought
it!”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“好吧，我发誓!”她说，她自己说的是相当宽泛的约克郡话，因为没有人听见她说话，她感到非常惊讶。“听到这个的人！谁能想到呢!”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
There was so much to talk about. It seemed as if Colin could never hear enough
of Dickon and Captain and Soot and Nut and Shell and the pony whose name was
Jump. Mary had run round into the wood with Dickon to see Jump. He was a tiny
little shaggy moor pony with thick locks hanging over his eyes and with a
pretty face and a nuzzling velvet nose. He was rather thin with living on moor
grass but he was as tough and wiry as if the muscle in his little legs had been
made of steel springs. He had lifted his head and whinnied softly the moment he
saw Dickon and he had trotted up to him and put his head across his shoulder
and then Dickon had talked into his ear and Jump had talked back in odd little
whinnies and puffs and snorts. Dickon had made him give Mary his small front
hoof and kiss her on her cheek with his velvet muzzle.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">有很多话要说。科林似乎永远听不够迪肯、船长、烟灰、坚果、壳牌和那匹名叫“跳跃”的小马。玛丽和迪肯跑到树林里去看跳跃。他是一匹毛茸茸的矮小荒野小马，浓密的头发遮住了他的眼睛，有着一张漂亮的脸蛋和一个天鹅绒般的鼻子。因为生活在荒野的草地上，他相当瘦，但是他的小腿上的肌肉却像钢弹簧一样坚韧而结实。当他看到迪肯的时候，他抬起头轻轻地嘶叫着，小跑过去把头靠在他的肩膀上，然后迪肯对着他的耳朵说话，跳跃用奇怪的声音回应他。迪肯让他把自己的小前蹄给了玛丽，并用天鹅绒般的口吻吻了吻她的脸颊。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source">
“Does he really understand everything Dickon says?” Colin asked.
</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source">
“It seems as if he does,” answered Mary. “Dickon says
anything will understand if you’re friends with it for sure, but you have
to be friends for sure.”
</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source">
Colin lay quiet a little while and his strange gray eyes seemed to be staring
at the wall, but Mary saw he was thinking.
</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source">
“I wish I was friends with things,” he said at last, “but
I’m not. I never had anything to be friends with, and I can’t bear
people.”
</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“Can’t you bear me?” asked Mary.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“你受不了我吗?”玛丽问。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source">
“Yes, I can,” he answered. “It’s funny but I even like
you.”
</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“Ben Weatherstaff said I was like him,” said Mary. “He said
he’d warrant we’d both got the same nasty tempers. I think you are
like him too. We are all three alike—you and I and Ben Weatherstaff. He
said we were neither of us much to look at and we were as sour as we looked.
But I don’t feel as sour as I used to before I knew the robin and
Dickon.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“本 · 韦瑟斯塔夫说我像他,”玛丽说。“他说他保证我们都有同样的坏脾气。我觉得你也像他。我们三个都是一样的，你和我还有 Ben Weatherstaff。他说我们两个都不怎么招人喜欢，而且我们看起来都很酸溜溜的。但我不再像认识知更鸟和迪肯之前那样觉得酸酸的了。”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source">
“Did you feel as if you hated people?”
</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source">
“Yes,” answered Mary without any affectation. “I should have
detested you if I had seen you before I saw the robin and Dickon.”
</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source">
Colin put out his thin hand and touched her.
</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“Mary,” he said, “I wish I hadn’t said what I did about
sending Dickon away. I hated you when you said he was like an angel and I
laughed at you but—but perhaps he is.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“玛丽,”他说，“我希望我没有说出把迪肯送走的事情。当你说他像天使一样时，我恨你，我嘲笑你，但ーー也许他确实是。”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“Well, it was rather funny to say it,” she admitted frankly,
“because his nose does turn up and he has a big mouth and his clothes
have patches all over them and he talks broad Yorkshire, but—but if an
angel did come to Yorkshire and live on the moor—if there was a Yorkshire
angel—I believe he’d understand the green things and know how to
make them grow and he would know how to talk to the wild creatures as Dickon
does and they’d know he was friends for sure.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">她坦率地承认: “嗯，说起来挺有趣的，因为他的鼻子是翘起来的，他的嘴巴很大，他的衣服上都是补丁，他会说约克郡的话，但是ーー但是如果一个天使真的来到约克郡，住在沼地上ーー如果有一个约克郡的天使ーー我相信他会了解绿色的东西，知道如何让它们生长，他会像迪肯一样知道如何与野生动物交谈，它们肯定会知道他是朋友。”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source">
“I shouldn’t mind Dickon looking at me,” said Colin; “I
want to see him.”
</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source">
“I’m glad you said that,” answered Mary,
“because—because—”
</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source">
Quite suddenly it came into her mind that this was the minute to tell him.
Colin knew something new was coming.
</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“Because what?” he cried eagerly.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“因为什么?”他急切地喊道。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source">
Mary was so anxious that she got up from her stool and came to him and caught
hold of both his hands.
</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source">
“Can I trust you? I trusted Dickon because birds trusted him. Can I trust
you—for sure—<i>for sure?</i>” she implored.
</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
Her face was so solemn that he almost whispered his answer.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">她的脸色非常严肃，他几乎低声回答。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“Yes—yes!”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“是的，是的!”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“Well, Dickon will come to see you tomorrow morning, and he’ll
bring his creatures with him.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“好吧，迪肯明天早上会来看你，他会带着他的宠物一起来的。”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“Oh! Oh!” Colin cried out in delight.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“噢! 噢!”科林高兴地叫了起来。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“But that’s not all,” Mary went on, almost pale with solemn
excitement. “The rest is better. There is a door into the garden. I found
it. It is under the ivy on the wall.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“但这还不是全部,”玛丽接着说，脸色几乎因为严肃的兴奋而变得苍白。“其余的更好。有一扇通往花园的门。我找到了。它在墙上的常春藤下面。”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
If he had been a strong healthy boy Colin would probably have shouted
“Hooray! Hooray! Hooray!” but he was weak and rather hysterical;
his eyes grew bigger and bigger and he gasped for breath.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">如果他是一个强壮健康的男孩，科林可能会大喊: “万岁！万岁！万岁!”但是他很虚弱，而且相当歇斯底里; 他的眼睛变得越来越大，他喘不过气来。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“Oh! Mary!” he cried out with a half sob. “Shall I see it?
Shall I get into it? Shall I <i>live</i> to get into it?” and he clutched
her hands and dragged her toward him.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“哦！玛丽!”他半哭着喊了出来。我能看看吗？要我进去吗？我能活着进去吗?”他抓住她的手，把她拉向自己。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“Of course you’ll see it!” snapped Mary indignantly.
“Of course you’ll live to get into it! Don’t be silly!”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“你当然会看到!”玛丽气愤地厉声说。“你当然会活着进去! 别傻了!”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
And she was so un-hysterical and natural and childish that she brought him to
his senses and he began to laugh at himself and a few minutes afterward she was
sitting on her stool again telling him not what she imagined the secret garden
to be like but what it really was, and Colin’s aches and tiredness were
forgotten and he was listening enraptured.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">她是如此的不歇斯底里，自然和孩子气，她使他恢复理智，他开始嘲笑自己，几分钟后，她又坐在她的凳子上告诉他，不是她想象的秘密花园是什么样子，但它真的是什么样子，科林的疼痛和疲劳被忘记了，他听着欣喜若狂。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“It is just what you thought it would be,” he said at last.
“It sounds just as if you had really seen it. You know I said that when
you told me first.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“这就是你想的那样,”他最后说。“听起来就好像你真的看到了一样。你知道你第一次告诉我的时候我就这么说了”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
Mary hesitated about two minutes and then boldly spoke the truth.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">玛丽犹豫了两分钟，然后大胆地说出了真相。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“I had seen it—and I had been in,” she said. “I found
the key and got in weeks ago. But I daren’t tell you—I
daren’t because I was so afraid I couldn’t trust you—<i>for
sure!</i>”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">她说: “我看到了，我也进去过。”。”我找到了钥匙，几周前就进来了。但是我不敢告诉你ーー我不敢，因为我太害怕我不能相信你ーー当然!”</p>

“IT HAS COME!”<font class="cyxy-trs-target"> “它来了!”</font></h2>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
Of course Dr. Craven had been sent for the morning after Colin had had his
tantrum. He was always sent for at once when such a thing occurred and he
always found, when he arrived, a white shaken boy lying on his bed, sulky and
still so hysterical that he was ready to break into fresh sobbing at the least
word. In fact, Dr. Craven dreaded and detested the difficulties of these
visits. On this occasion he was away from Misselthwaite Manor until afternoon.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">当然，克雷文医生是在科林发脾气后的第二天早上被派来的。每当这样的事情发生时，他总是立刻被叫去，当他到达时，他总是发现一个浑身发抖的白人男孩躺在他的床上，闷闷不乐，还是那么歇斯底里，以至于他随时准备重新抽泣起来，哪怕只是一句话。事实上，克雷文医生对这些访问的困难感到恐惧和厌恶。这次他离开 Misselthwaite Manor 一直到下午。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“How is he?” he asked Mrs. Medlock rather irritably when he
arrived. “He will break a blood-vessel in one of those fits some day. The
boy is half insane with hysteria and self-indulgence.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“他怎么样?”当他到达时，他很生气地问梅德洛克太太。“总有一天，他会突然发作，把一根血管弄断。这孩子有点神经质，歇斯底里，自我放纵。”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“Well, sir,” answered Mrs. Medlock, “you’ll scarcely
believe your eyes when you see him. That plain sour-faced child that’s
almost as bad as himself has just bewitched him. How she’s done it
there’s no telling. The Lord knows she’s nothing to look at and you
scarcely ever hear her speak, but she did what none of us dare do. She just
flew at him like a little cat last night, and stamped her feet and ordered him
to stop screaming, and somehow she startled him so that he actually did stop,
and this afternoon—well just come up and see, sir. It’s past
crediting.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“好吧，先生,”梅德洛克太太回答说，“当你看到他的时候，你简直不敢相信自己的眼睛。那个几乎和他一样坏的一脸苦相的孩子刚刚迷惑了他。不知道她是怎么做到的。上帝知道她没什么好看的你几乎听不到她说话但她做了我们都不敢做的事。她昨晚像只小猫一样扑向他，跺跺脚，命令他停止尖叫，不知怎么地，她吓到了他，所以他真的停了下来，今天下午我们就上来看看，先生。这已经是过去式了。”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
The scene which Dr. Craven beheld when he entered his patient’s room was
indeed rather astonishing to him. As Mrs. Medlock opened the door he heard
laughing and chattering. Colin was on his sofa in his dressing-gown and he was
sitting up quite straight looking at a picture in one of the garden books and
talking to the plain child who at that moment could scarcely be called plain at
all because her face was so glowing with enjoyment.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">克雷文医生走进病人房间时所看到的景象确实令他感到相当惊讶。当梅德洛克太太打开门时，他听到有人在笑和聊天。科林穿着睡袍，坐在沙发上，笔直地看着一本园林书籍里的一张图片，跟一个平凡的小女孩说着话，那个小女孩此刻几乎称不上平凡，因为她的脸上洋溢着愉悦的光芒。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“Those long spires of blue ones—we’ll have a lot of
those,” Colin was announcing. “They’re called
Del-phin-iums.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“那些蓝色的长尖塔ーー我们会有很多这样的尖塔,”科林宣布，“它们叫做 Del-phin-iums。”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“Dickon says they’re larkspurs made big and grand,” cried
Mistress Mary. “There are clumps there already.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“迪肯说它们是又大又壮的老鹰刺,”玛丽太太喊道，“那里已经有一些树丛了。”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
Then they saw Dr. Craven and stopped. Mary became quite still and Colin looked
fretful.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">然后他们看到了克雷文医生，停了下来。玛丽变得一动不动，科林看起来很烦躁。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“I am sorry to hear you were ill last night, my boy,” Dr. Craven
said a trifle nervously. He was rather a nervous man.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“听说你昨晚生病了，我很难过，孩子,”克雷文医生有点紧张地说。他是个相当紧张的人。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“I’m better now—much better,” Colin answered, rather
like a Rajah. “I’m going out in my chair in a day or two if it is
fine. I want some fresh air.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“我现在好多了，好多了,”科林回答说，很像一个国王。“如果天气好的话，过一两天我就要坐在椅子上出去了。我想呼吸点新鲜空气”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
Dr. Craven sat down by him and felt his pulse and looked at him curiously.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">克雷文医生在他身边坐下，摸了摸他的脉搏，好奇地看着他。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“It must be a very fine day,” he said, “and you must be very
careful not to tire yourself.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“天气一定很好,”他说，“你一定要非常小心，不要累着自己。”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“Fresh air won’t tire me,” said the young Rajah.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“新鲜空气不会使我疲倦,”年轻的国王说。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
As there had been occasions when this same young gentleman had shrieked aloud
with rage and had insisted that fresh air would give him cold and kill him, it
is not to be wondered at that his doctor felt somewhat startled.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">由于这位年轻的绅士曾多次愤怒地大声尖叫，坚称新鲜空气会使他感到寒冷而死亡，因此他的医生感到有些吃惊也就不足为奇了。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“I thought you did not like fresh air,” he said.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“我以为你不喜欢新鲜空气,”他说。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“I don’t when I am by myself,” replied the Rajah; “but
my cousin is going out with me.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“我一个人的时候不会,”国王回答说，“但是我表弟要和我一起出去。”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“And the nurse, of course?” suggested Dr. Craven.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“当然还有那个护士?”克雷文医生建议道。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“No, I will not have the nurse,” so magnificently that Mary could
not help remembering how the young native Prince had looked with his diamonds
and emeralds and pearls stuck all over him and the great rubies on the small
dark hand he had waved to command his servants to approach with salaams and
receive his orders.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“不，我不要护士。”玛丽不禁想起了年轻的土著王子戴着钻石、绿宝石和珍珠的样子，还有他挥手示意仆人接受他的命令时黑色小手上的巨大红宝石。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“My cousin knows how to take care of me. I am always better when she is
with me. She made me better last night. A very strong boy I know will push my
carriage.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“我表哥知道怎么照顾我。当她和我在一起时，我总是感觉更好。她昨晚让我好起来了。我认识的一个很强壮的男孩会推我的马车。”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
Dr. Craven felt rather alarmed. If this tiresome hysterical boy should chance
to get well he himself would lose all chance of inheriting Misselthwaite; but
he was not an unscrupulous man, though he was a weak one, and he did not intend
to let him run into actual danger.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">克雷文医生感到相当惊慌。如果这个令人厌烦的歇斯底里的男孩有机会康复，他自己也将失去继承米瑟斯维特的机会; 但他不是一个肆无忌惮的人，虽然他是一个软弱的人，他不打算让他遇到真正的危险。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“He must be a strong boy and a steady boy,” he said. “And I
must know something about him. Who is he? What is his name?”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“他必须是一个强壮的男孩和一个稳重的男孩,”他说。我必须了解他。他是谁？他叫什么名字?”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“It’s Dickon,” Mary spoke up suddenly. She felt somehow that
everybody who knew the moor must know Dickon. And she was right, too. She saw
that in a moment Dr. Craven’s serious face relaxed into a relieved smile.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“是狄肯,”玛丽突然开口说。不知怎么的，她觉得每个认识沼地的人一定都认识迪肯。她也是对的。她看到克雷文医生严肃的脸一下子放松下来，露出一个如释重负的微笑。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“Oh, Dickon,” he said. “If it is Dickon you will be safe
enough. He’s as strong as a moor pony, is Dickon.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“哦，迪肯,”他说。“如果是迪肯，你会很安全。迪肯就像一匹野马一样强壮</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“And he’s trusty,” said Mary. “He’s th’
trustiest lad i’ Yorkshire.” She had been talking Yorkshire to
Colin and she forgot herself.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“他很可靠,”玛丽说。“他是约克郡最值得信赖的小伙子”她一直在跟科林说约克郡的事，结果忘了自己在说什么。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“Did Dickon teach you that?” asked Dr. Craven, laughing outright.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“迪肯教你的吗?”克雷文医生问，哈哈大笑。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“I’m learning it as if it was French,” said Mary rather
coldly. “It’s like a native dialect in India. Very clever people
try to learn them. I like it and so does Colin.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“我把它当作法语来学,”玛丽冷冷地说。“这就像是印度当地的一种方言。非常聪明的人努力学习它们。我喜欢，科林也是</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“Well, well,” he said. “If it amuses you perhaps it
won’t do you any harm. Did you take your bromide last night, Colin?”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“好吧，好吧,”他说。“如果你觉得有趣，也许它不会对你造成任何伤害。科林，你昨晚有没有服用溴化物?”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“No,” Colin answered. “I wouldn’t take it at first and
after Mary made me quiet she talked me to sleep—in a low
voice—about the spring creeping into a garden.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“不,”科林回答。“一开始我不愿意接受，在玛丽让我安静下来之后，她用低沉的声音让我入睡，告诉我春天悄悄地进入了一个花园。”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“That sounds soothing,” said Dr. Craven, more perplexed than ever
and glancing sideways at Mistress Mary sitting on her stool and looking down
silently at the carpet. “You are evidently better, but you must
remember—”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“听起来很舒服,”克雷文医生说，比以往任何时候都更加困惑，他斜着眼睛看了一眼坐在凳子上的玛丽小姐，低头默默地看着地毯。“你显然好多了，但你必须记住...”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“I don’t want to remember,” interrupted the Rajah, appearing
again. “When I lie by myself and remember I begin to have pains
everywhere and I think of things that make me begin to scream because I hate
them so. If there was a doctor anywhere who could make you forget you were ill
instead of remembering it I would have him brought here.” And he waved a
thin hand which ought really to have been covered with royal signet rings made
of rubies. “It is because my cousin makes me forget that she makes me
better.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“我不想记得,”国王打断了他，又出现了。“当我一个人躺着的时候，我记得我开始到处都感到疼痛，我想到的事情让我开始尖叫，因为我很讨厌它们。如果有医生能让你忘记自己病了而不是记起来，我会把他带到这里来。”他挥舞着一只纤细的手，手上应该戴着用红宝石制成的皇家印章戒指。“那是因为我的表妹让我忘记了她让我变得更好。”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
Dr. Craven had never made such a short stay after a “tantrum”;
usually he was obliged to remain a very long time and do a great many things.
This afternoon he did not give any medicine or leave any new orders and he was
spared any disagreeable scenes. When he went downstairs he looked very
thoughtful and when he talked to Mrs. Medlock in the library she felt that he
was a much puzzled man.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">克雷文医生从来没有在一次“发脾气”之后停留过这么短的时间; 通常他不得不停留很长时间，做很多事情。今天下午，他没有给任何药物，也没有留下任何新的命令，也没有出现任何不愉快的场面。当他下楼的时候，他看起来很沉思，当他在图书馆和梅德洛克太太说话的时候，她觉得他是一个非常困惑的人。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“Well, sir,” she ventured, “could you have believed
it?”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“好吧，先生,”她大胆地说，“你能相信吗?”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“It is certainly a new state of affairs,” said the doctor.
“And there’s no denying it is better than the old one.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“这当然是一种新的情况,”医生说。“不可否认，它比旧的要好。”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“I believe Susan Sowerby’s right—I do that,” said Mrs.
Medlock. “I stopped in her cottage on my way to Thwaite yesterday and had
a bit of talk with her. And she says to me, ‘Well, Sarah Ann, she
mayn’t be a good child, an’ she mayn’t be a pretty one, but
she’s a child, an’ children needs children.’ We went to
school together, Susan Sowerby and me.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“我相信苏珊 · 索尔比是对的ーー我就是这样做的,”梅德洛克太太说。“我昨天在去斯韦特的路上去了她的小屋，和她聊了一会儿。她对我说，‘莎拉 · 安，她可能不是一个好孩子，她可能不是一个漂亮的孩子，但她是一个孩子，孩子需要孩子。’。我们是同学，苏珊 · 索尔比和我。”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“She’s the best sick nurse I know,” said Dr. Craven.
“When I find her in a cottage I know the chances are that I shall save my
patient.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“她是我认识的最好的生病护士,”克雷文医生说。“当我在一间小屋里发现她时，我知道我有机会救我的病人。”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
Mrs. Medlock smiled. She was fond of Susan Sowerby.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">梅德洛克太太笑了，她很喜欢苏珊 · 索尔比。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“She’s got a way with her, has Susan,” she went on quite
volubly. “I’ve been thinking all morning of one thing she said
yesterday. She says, ‘Once when I was givin’ th’ children a
bit of a preach after they’d been fightin’ I ses to ’em all,
“When I was at school my jography told as th’ world was shaped like
a orange an’ I found out before I was ten that th’ whole orange
doesn’t belong to nobody. No one owns more than his bit of a quarter
an’ there’s times it seems like there’s not enow quarters to
go round. But don’t you—none o’ you—think as you own
th’ whole orange or you’ll find out you’re mistaken,
an’ you won’t find it out without hard knocks.” ‘What
children learns from children,’ she says, ‘is that there’s no
sense in grabbin’ at th’ whole orange—peel an’ all. If

too bitter to eat.’”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“苏珊对她很有一套,”她滔滔不绝地继续说。“我整个上午都在想她昨天说的一件事。她说，‘有一次，孩子们打架后，我给他们讲道，‘我感谢他们所有人。’”“当我在学校的时候，我的作文告诉我，世界是橙子形状的，我在十岁之前就发现，整个橙子不属于任何人。没有人拥有超过一个季度的比特和有时似乎没有现在的季度去周转。但是你不要以为你拥有整个橘子，否则你会发现你错了，而且你不会在没有严厉的打击下发现它。”她说，孩子们从孩子们身上学到的是，抓住整个橘子——剥掉所有橘子皮——是没有意义的。如果你这样做，你可能连点心都吃不到，而且它们太苦了，吃不下去。”</p>

“She’s a shrewd woman,” said Dr. Craven, putting on his coat.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“她是个精明的女人,”克雷文医生一边说，一边穿上外套。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“Well, she’s got a way of saying things,” ended Mrs. Medlock,
much pleased. “Sometimes I’ve said to her, ‘Eh! Susan, if you
was a different woman an’ didn’t talk such broad Yorkshire

</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“嗯，她有一套说话的方法,”梅德洛克太太高兴地结束了话。“有时我对她说，‘哎！苏珊，如果你是另外一个女人，而且不说这么宽泛的约克郡话，我见过很多次我应该说你很聪明的时候。”</p>

That night Colin slept without once awakening and when he opened his eyes in
the morning he lay still and smiled without knowing it—smiled because he
felt so curiously comfortable. It was actually nice to be awake, and he turned
over and stretched his limbs luxuriously. He felt as if tight strings which had
held him had loosened themselves and let him go. He did not know that Dr.
Craven would have said that his nerves had relaxed and rested themselves.
Instead of lying and staring at the wall and wishing he had not awakened, his
mind was full of the plans he and Mary had made yesterday, of pictures of the
garden and of Dickon and his wild creatures. It was so nice to have things to
think about. And he had not been awake more than ten minutes when he heard feet
running along the corridor and Mary was at the door. The next minute she was in
the room and had run across to his bed, bringing with her a waft of fresh air
full of the scent of the morning.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">那天晚上，科林一觉没醒，早上睁开眼睛时，他静静地躺着，不知不觉地笑了起来ーー笑是因为他觉得好奇地舒服。醒来的感觉真好，他翻了个身，舒舒服服地伸了伸四肢。他觉得好像束缚着他的紧绷的弦松开了，让他走了。他不知道克雷文医生会说他的神经已经放松和休息了。他没有躺在那里，盯着墙壁，希望自己没有醒来，而是满脑子都是他和玛丽昨天做的计划，花园的图画，狄肯和他的野兽们。有事情可以思考真是太好了。他醒来还不到十分钟，就听到走廊上有脚步声，玛丽就在门口。下一分钟，她来到房间，跑到他的床边，带来一阵清新的空气，充满了早晨的气息。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“You’ve been out! You’ve been out! There’s that nice
smell of leaves!” he cried.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“你出去过了! 你出去过了! 那里有一股树叶的香味!”他喊道。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
She had been running and her hair was loose and blown and she was bright with
the air and pink-cheeked, though he could not see it.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">她一直在跑，她的头发松散和吹，她是明亮的空气和粉红色的脸颊，虽然他不能看到它。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“It’s so beautiful!” she said, a little breathless with her
speed. “You never saw anything so beautiful! It has <i>come!</i> I
thought it had come that other morning, but it was only coming. It is here now!
It has come, the Spring! Dickon says so!”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“太美了!”她说，她的速度有点喘不过气来。“你从未见过如此美丽的东西！它来了！我以为是那天早上，但它只是来了。它现在就在这里！春天来了！迪肯是这么说的!”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“Has it?” cried Colin, and though he really knew nothing about it
he felt his heart beat. He actually sat up in bed.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“是吗?”科林喊道，虽然他真的对此一无所知，但他感到自己的心在跳动。他真的在床上坐起来了。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“Open the window!” he added, laughing half with joyful excitement
and half at his own fancy. “Perhaps we may hear golden trumpets!”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“打开窗户!”他又补充了一句，一半高兴地兴奋地笑着，一半为自己的幻想而笑。“也许我们可以听到金喇叭!”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
And though he laughed, Mary was at the window in a moment and in a moment more
it was opened wide and freshness and softness and scents and birds’ songs
were pouring through.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">尽管他笑了，玛丽还是立刻来到了窗前，不一会儿窗子就打开了，清新、柔软、芬芳和鸟儿的歌声从窗外倾泻而出。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“That’s fresh air,” she said. “Lie on your back and
draw in long breaths of it. That’s what Dickon does when he’s lying
on the moor. He says he feels it in his veins and it makes him strong and he
feels as if he could live forever and ever. Breathe it and breathe it.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“那是新鲜空气,”她说。仰卧，深呼吸。迪肯躺在沼地上的时候就是这么做的。他说他的血管里有这种感觉，这种感觉让他变得坚强，他觉得自己可以永远活下去。深呼吸，深呼吸”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
She was only repeating what Dickon had told her, but she caught Colin’s
fancy.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">她只是在重复迪肯告诉她的话，但她被科林迷住了。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“’Forever and ever’! Does it make him feel like that?”
he said, and he did as she told him, drawing in long deep breaths over and over
again until he felt that something quite new and delightful was happening to
him.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“直到永远”！这让他有这种感觉吗?”他说，他照她说的做了，一遍又一遍地长长地深呼吸，直到他感觉到一些新鲜而令人愉快的事情正在发生在他身上。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
Mary was at his bedside again.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">玛丽又来到他的床边。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“Things are crowding up out of the earth,” she ran on in a hurry.
“And there are flowers uncurling and buds on everything and the green
veil has covered nearly all the gray and the birds are in such a hurry about
their nests for fear they may be too late that some of them are even fighting
for places in the secret garden. And the rose-bushes look as wick as wick can
be, and there are primroses in the lanes and woods, and the seeds we planted
are up, and Dickon has brought the fox and the crow and the squirrels and a
new-born lamb.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“地球上的东西都挤出来了,”她匆匆忙忙地跑着。“所有的东西上都开满了花蕾，绿色的面纱几乎覆盖了所有的灰色，鸟儿们匆匆忙忙地回到自己的巢穴，生怕自己来不及了，甚至有些鸟儿在争夺秘密花园的位置。”。玫瑰丛看起来像灯芯一样，小巷和树林里有报春花，我们种下的种子已经长出来了，迪肯带来了狐狸、乌鸦、松鼠和一只新生的小羊羔。”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
And then she paused for breath. The new-born lamb Dickon had found three days
before lying by its dead mother among the gorse bushes on the moor. It was not
the first motherless lamb he had found and he knew what to do with it. He had
taken it to the cottage wrapped in his jacket and he had let it lie near the
fire and had fed it with warm milk. It was a soft thing with a darling silly
baby face and legs rather long for its body. Dickon had carried it over the
moor in his arms and its feeding bottle was in his pocket with a squirrel, and
when Mary had sat under a tree with its limp warmness huddled on her lap she
had felt as if she were too full of strange joy to speak. A lamb—a lamb!
A living lamb who lay on your lap like a baby!
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">然后她停下来喘口气。迪肯在三天前发现了一只刚出生的小羊羔，它的母亲已经死了，它躺在沼泽地的金雀花丛中。这不是他找到的第一只失去母亲的羔羊，他知道该怎么处理它。他把它裹在外套里带到小屋，让它躺在火边，用热牛奶喂它。它是一个柔软的东西，有一张可爱的傻乎乎的婴儿脸和相当长的腿。迪肯把它抱在怀里，放在口袋里，里面还有一只松鼠。当玛丽坐在一棵树下，松软的温暖蜷缩在她的膝盖上时，她觉得自己好像充满了奇怪的快乐，说不出话来。一只羔羊，一只羔羊！一只活生生的羔羊像婴儿一样躺在你的腿上！</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
She was describing it with great joy and Colin was listening and drawing in
long breaths of air when the nurse entered. She started a little at the sight
of the open window. She had sat stifling in the room many a warm day because
her patient was sure that open windows gave people cold.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">当护士走进来的时候，她正兴高采烈地描述着，科林正在听着，长长地吸着气。她一看到开着的窗户就吓了一跳。她在房间里闷闷不乐地坐了许多天，因为她的病人确信开着的窗户会使人感到寒冷。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“Are you sure you are not chilly, Master Colin?” she inquired.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“你确定你不冷吗，科林少爷?”她问道。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“No,” was the answer. “I am breathing long breaths of fresh
air. It makes you strong. I am going to get up to the sofa for breakfast. My
cousin will have breakfast with me.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“不,”他回答道。”我在呼吸新鲜空气。它让你变得坚强。我要去沙发上吃早饭了。我表哥会和我一起吃早餐”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
The nurse went away, concealing a smile, to give the order for two breakfasts.
She found the servants’ hall a more amusing place than the
invalid’s chamber and just now everybody wanted to hear the news from
upstairs. There was a great deal of joking about the unpopular young recluse
who, as the cook said, “had found his master, and good for him.”
The servants’ hall had been very tired of the tantrums, and the butler,
who was a man with a family, had more than once expressed his opinion that the
invalid would be all the better “for a good hiding.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">护士走开了，掩饰着微笑，点了两份早餐。她发现仆人的大厅比病人的房间更有趣，刚才每个人都想从楼上听到这个消息。有很多关于这个不受欢迎的年轻隐士的玩笑，正如厨师所说，“他找到了他的主人，对他有好处。”仆人们的大厅已经厌倦了发脾气，有家室的男管家不止一次地表达了他的观点，认为病人最好“好好躲一躲”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
When Colin was on his sofa and the breakfast for two was put upon the table he
made an announcement to the nurse in his most Rajah-like manner.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">当科林坐在沙发上，两个人的早餐被放在桌子上时，他用最像王子的方式向护士宣布了一件事。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“A boy, and a fox, and a crow, and two squirrels, and a new-born lamb,
are coming to see me this morning. I want them brought upstairs as soon as they
come,” he said. “You are not to begin playing with the animals in
the servants’ hall and keep them there. I want them here.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“一个男孩，一只狐狸，一只乌鸦，两只松鼠，还有一只刚出生的小羊羔，今天早上要来看我。我希望他们一来就上楼来,”他表示。“你不能在仆人的大厅里和动物们玩耍，并把它们关在那里。我希望他们在这里。”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
The nurse gave a slight gasp and tried to conceal it with a cough.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">护士轻轻地喘了一口气，试图用咳嗽来掩饰。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“Yes, sir,” she answered.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“是的，先生,”她回答。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“I’ll tell you what you can do,” added Colin, waving his
hand. “You can tell Martha to bring them here. The boy is Martha’s
brother. His name is Dickon and he is an animal charmer.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“我来告诉你你能做什么,”科林挥挥手说。“你可以告诉玛莎把他们带到这里来。这个男孩是玛莎的弟弟。他叫迪肯，是个动物迷。”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“I hope the animals won’t bite, Master Colin,” said the
nurse.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“我希望动物不会咬人，科林少爷,”护士说。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“I told you he was a charmer,” said Colin austerely.
“Charmers’ animals never bite.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“我告诉过你，他是个迷人的家伙,”科林严肃地说，“迷人的动物从不咬人。”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“There are snake-charmers in India,” said Mary. “And they can
put their snakes’ heads in their mouths.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“印度有耍蛇人,”玛丽说，“他们可以把蛇头放进嘴里。”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“Goodness!” shuddered the nurse.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“天哪!”护士颤抖着说。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
They ate their breakfast with the morning air pouring in upon them.
Colin’s breakfast was a very good one and Mary watched him with serious
interest.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">他们在早晨的空气中吃早餐。科林的早餐很美味，玛丽饶有兴趣地看着他。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“You will begin to get fatter just as I did,” she said. “I
never wanted my breakfast when I was in India and now I always want it.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“你会像我一样开始变胖,”她说。“我在印度的时候从来不想吃早餐，现在我总是想吃。”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“I wanted mine this morning,” said Colin. “Perhaps it was the
fresh air. When do you think Dickon will come?”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“今天早上我想要我的,”科林说。“也许是因为新鲜空气。你认为迪肯什么时候会来?”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
He was not long in coming. In about ten minutes Mary held up her hand.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">他不久就来了。大约十分钟后，玛丽举起了她的手。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“Listen!” she said. “Did you hear a caw?”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“听!”她说，“你听到一只叫声了吗?”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
Colin listened and heard it, the oddest sound in the world to hear inside a
house, a hoarse “caw-caw.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">科林听着听着，这是世界上在房子里听到的最奇怪的声音，一种嘶哑的“呱呱”声</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“Yes,” he answered.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“是的,”他回答。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“That’s Soot,” said Mary. “Listen again. Do you hear a
bleat—a tiny one?”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“那是烟灰,”玛丽说，“再听一遍，你听到一种叫声吗? 一种很小的叫声。”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“Oh, yes!” cried Colin, quite flushing.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“哦，是的!”科林脸红得厉害，叫道。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“That’s the new-born lamb,” said Mary. “He’s
coming.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“那是新生的小羊羔,”玛丽说，“它来了。”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
Dickon’s moorland boots were thick and clumsy and though he tried to walk
quietly they made a clumping sound as he walked through the long corridors.
Mary and Colin heard him marching—marching, until he passed through the
tapestry door on to the soft carpet of Colin’s own passage.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">迪肯的沼泽地靴子又厚又笨重，尽管他试图悄悄地走，但是当他穿过长长的走廊时，靴子发出一种笨重的声音。玛丽和科林听到他在行军，直到他穿过挂毯门，来到科林走过的柔软地毯上。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“If you please, sir,” announced Martha, opening the door, “if
you please, sir, here’s Dickon an’ his creatures.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“请吧，先生,”玛莎打开门说，“请吧，先生，这是迪肯和他的宠物。”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
Dickon came in smiling his nicest wide smile. The new-born lamb was in his arms
and the little red fox trotted by his side. Nut sat on his left shoulder and
Soot on his right and Shell’s head and paws peeped out of his coat
pocket.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">迪肯带着他最灿烂的笑容走了进来。新生的小羊羔在他怀里，小红狐在他身边小跑。坚果坐在他的左肩上，苏特坐在他的右肩上，壳牌的头和爪子从他的大衣口袋里探出头来。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
Colin slowly sat up and stared and stared—as he had stared when he first
saw Mary; but this was a stare of wonder and delight. The truth was that in
spite of all he had heard he had not in the least understood what this boy
would be like and that his fox and his crow and his squirrels and his lamb were
so near to him and his friendliness that they seemed almost to be part of
himself. Colin had never talked to a boy in his life and he was so overwhelmed
by his own pleasure and curiosity that he did not even think of speaking.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">科林慢慢地坐起来，盯着看——就像他第一次看到玛丽时那样; 但这是一种惊奇和高兴的目光。事实是，尽管他听说了这一切，但他一点也不明白这个男孩会是什么样子，他的狐狸、乌鸦、松鼠和小羊离他如此之近，他的友好似乎是他自己的一部分。科林这辈子从来没有和男孩说过话，他被自己的快乐和好奇心压得喘不过气来，甚至连说话的念头都没有。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
But Dickon did not feel the least shy or awkward. He had not felt embarrassed
because the crow had not known his language and had only stared and had not
spoken to him the first time they met. Creatures were always like that until
they found out about you. He walked over to Colin’s sofa and put the
new-born lamb quietly on his lap, and immediately the little creature turned to
the warm velvet dressing-gown and began to nuzzle and nuzzle into its folds and
butt its tight-curled head with soft impatience against his side. Of course no
boy could have helped speaking then.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">但迪肯一点也不觉得害羞或尴尬。他没有感到尴尬，因为乌鸦不懂他的语言，只是盯着他看，在他们第一次见面时没有和他说话。怪物在发现你之前都是这样的。他走到科林的沙发上，把刚出生的小羊羔安静地放在他的膝盖上，小家伙立刻转向温暖的天鹅绒睡衣，开始用鼻子蹭它的褶皱，用它紧紧卷曲的头顶着他的身体，柔和而不耐烦。当然那时候没有一个男孩会说话。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“What is it doing?” cried Colin. “What does it want?”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“它在干什么?”科林喊道。“它想要什么?”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“It wants its mother,” said Dickon, smiling more and more. “I
brought it to thee a bit hungry because I knowed tha’d like to see it
feed.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“它想要它的妈妈,”迪肯说，笑得越来越多。“我把它带给你的时候有点饿，因为我知道你想看到它进食。”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
He knelt down by the sofa and took a feeding-bottle from his pocket.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">他跪在沙发旁，从口袋里拿出一个奶瓶。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“Come on, little ’un,” he said, turning the small woolly
white head with a gentle brown hand. “This is what tha’s after.
Tha’ll get more out o’ this than tha’ will out o’ silk
velvet coats. There now,” and he pushed the rubber tip of the bottle into
the nuzzling mouth and the lamb began to suck it with ravenous ecstasy.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“来吧，小不点,”他说，用一只温柔的棕色手转动着那个毛茸茸的白色小脑袋。“这就是你想要的”。比起丝绒大衣，你能从中得到更多。现在好了,”他把瓶子的橡胶尖推进鼻子里，小羊开始贪婪地狂喜地吮吸着。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
After that there was no wondering what to say. By the time the lamb fell asleep
questions poured forth and Dickon answered them all. He told them how he had
found the lamb just as the sun was rising three mornings ago. He had been
standing on the moor listening to a skylark and watching him swing higher and
higher into the sky until he was only a speck in the heights of blue.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">从那以后，我就不知道该说些什么了。等到小羊睡着了，问题接踵而至，狄肯全都回答了。他告诉他们他是如何在三天前太阳升起的时候找到这只小羊的。他一直站在荒原上，听着云雀的叫声，看着云雀越飞越高，直到变成蓝色高地上的一个小点。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“I’d almost lost him but for his song an’ I was
wonderin’ how a chap could hear it when it seemed as if he’d get
out o’ th’ world in a minute—an’ just then I heard
somethin’ else far off among th’ gorse bushes. It was a weak
bleatin’ an’ I knowed it was a new lamb as was hungry an’ I
knowed it wouldn’t be hungry if it hadn’t lost its mother somehow,
so I set off searchin’. Eh! I did have a look for it. I went in an’
out among th’ gorse bushes an’ round an’ round an’ I
always seemed to take th’ wrong turnin’. But at last I seed a bit
o’ white by a rock on top o’ th’ moor an’ I climbed up
an’ found th’ little ’un half dead wi’ cold an’
clemmin’.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“我几乎失去了他，但他的歌声和‘我在想，一个小伙子怎么能听到它，当它似乎在一分钟内就要离开这个世界的时候’，就在那时，我听到了金雀花丛中远处的其他声音。那是一只虚弱的咩咩叫声，我知道那是一只新生的小羊羔，因为它饿了，我知道如果它没有失去母亲，它就不会饿，所以我开始寻找。呃！我确实找过了。我在金雀花丛中走了一圈又一圈，似乎总是走错路。但是最后我在荒野上的一块石头旁边种下了一点白色的种子，我爬上去，发现了一个半死不活的小家伙，冻得要死。”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
While he talked, Soot flew solemnly in and out of the open window and cawed
remarks about the scenery while Nut and Shell made excursions into the big
trees outside and ran up and down trunks and explored branches. Captain curled
up near Dickon, who sat on the hearth-rug from preference.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">在他说话的时候，苏特庄严地从开着的窗户进进出出，叽叽喳喳地谈论着风景，而坚果和壳牌则在外面的大树里走来走去，在树干上跑上跑下，探索着树枝。船长蜷缩在迪肯身边，迪肯喜欢坐在壁炉边的地毯上。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
They looked at the pictures in the gardening books and Dickon knew all the
flowers by their country names and knew exactly which ones were already growing
in the secret garden.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">他们看着园艺书籍上的图画，狄肯知道所有的花都是他们国家的名字，并且确切地知道哪些花已经在秘密花园里生长了。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“I couldna’ say that there name,” he said, pointing to one
under which was written “Aquilegia,” “but us calls that a

wild in hedges, but these is garden ones an’ they’re bigger
an’ grander. There’s some big clumps o’ columbine in

very windy days and then Colin was threatened with a cold, which two things
happening one after the other would no doubt have thrown him into a rage but
that there was so much careful and mysterious planning to do and almost every
day Dickon came in, if only for a few minutes, to talk about what was happening
on the moor and in the lanes and hedges and on the borders of streams. The
things he had to tell about otters’ and badgers’ and
water-rats’ houses, not to mention birds’ nests and field-mice and
their burrows, were enough to make you almost tremble with excitement when you
heard all the intimate details from an animal charmer and realized with what
thrilling eagerness and anxiety the whole busy underworld was working.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">但是他们不得不等了一个多星期，因为一开始有几天刮大风，然后科林受到感冒的威胁，这两件事一件接一件的发生无疑会让他大发雷霆，但是有那么多细致和神秘的计划要做，几乎每天迪肯都会来，哪怕只有几分钟，谈论在沼地、小巷、树篱和溪流边缘发生的事情。他不得不告诉你的关于水獭、獾、水鼠的房子，更不用说鸟巢、田鼠和它们的洞穴的事情，足以让你兴奋得几乎颤抖，当你从一个动物玩家那里听到所有私密的细节，并且意识到整个繁忙的地下世界是多么令人激动的渴望和焦虑。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“They’re same as us,” said Dickon, “only they have to
build their homes every year. An’ it keeps ’em so busy they fair
scuffle to get ’em done.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“他们和我们一样,”迪肯说，“只不过他们每年都得盖房子。这让他们忙得不可开交。”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
The most absorbing thing, however, was the preparations to be made before Colin
could be transported with sufficient secrecy to the garden. No one must see the
chair-carriage and Dickon and Mary after they turned a certain corner of the
shrubbery and entered upon the walk outside the ivied walls. As each day
passed, Colin had become more and more fixed in his feeling that the mystery
surrounding the garden was one of its greatest charms. Nothing must spoil that.
No one must ever suspect that they had a secret. People must think that he was
simply going out with Mary and Dickon because he liked them and did not object
to their looking at him. They had long and quite delightful talks about their
route. They would go up this path and down that one and cross the other and go
round among the fountain flower-beds as if they were looking at the
“bedding-out plants” the head gardener, Mr. Roach, had been having
arranged. That would seem such a rational thing to do that no one would think
it at all mysterious. They would turn into the shrubbery walks and lose
themselves until they came to the long walls. It was almost as serious and
elaborately thought out as the plans of march made by great generals in time of
war.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">然而，最吸引人的事情是在科林秘密地被送到花园之前要做的准备工作。当狄肯和玛丽转过灌木丛的某个角落，走进爬满常青藤的墙外的步道时，没有人可以看见他们，也没有人可以看见他们。随着日子一天天过去，科林越来越坚定地认为，围绕着花园的神秘感是它最大的魅力之一。什么都不能破坏这一点。不能让任何人怀疑他们有秘密。人们一定认为他只是在和玛丽和迪肯约会，因为他喜欢她们，而且不反对她们看他。他们就他们的路线进行了漫长而愉快的谈话。他们会沿着这条小路，沿着那条小路，穿过另一条小路，在喷泉花坛中转来转去，就好像他们在看园丁头儿罗奇先生已经安排好的那些“用来铺垫的植物”。这样做似乎很合理，没有人会认为它是神秘的。他们会转入灌木丛中，迷失自我，直到来到长长的城墙前。这几乎和战时大将军们制定的进军计划一样严肃和精心。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
Rumors of the new and curious things which were occurring in the
invalid’s apartments had of course filtered through the servants’
hall into the stable yards and out among the gardeners, but notwithstanding
this, Mr. Roach was startled one day when he received orders from Master
Colin’s room to the effect that he must report himself in the apartment
no outsider had ever seen, as the invalid himself desired to speak to him.

“Well, well,” he said to himself as he hurriedly changed his coat,

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
Mr. Roach was not without curiosity. He had never caught even a glimpse of the
boy and had heard a dozen exaggerated stories about his uncanny looks and ways
and his insane tempers. The thing he had heard oftenest was that he might die
at any moment and there had been numerous fanciful descriptions of a humped
back and helpless limbs, given by people who had never seen him.

“They couldn’t well change for the worse,” she continued;

more at home than you or me could ever be.”

It was perhaps well he had been prepared or he might have been startled. When
the bedroom door was opened a large crow, which seemed quite at home perched on
the high back of a carven chair, announced the entrance of a visitor by saying

Not a human creature was to be caught sight of in the paths they took. In fact

</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“这就是知更鸟飞过围墙的地方,”她说。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“Is it?” cried Colin. “Oh! I wish he’d come
again!”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“是吗?”科林喊道。“噢! 我希望他能再来一次!”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“And that,” said Mary with solemn delight, pointing under a big
lilac bush, “is where he perched on the little heap of earth and showed
me the key.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“那儿,”玛丽指着一棵大丁香树下，神情庄重而高兴地说，“就是他栖息在那小土堆上，给我看钥匙的地方。”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
Then Colin sat up.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">然后科林坐了起来。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“Where? Where? There?” he cried, and his eyes were as big as the
wolf’s in Red Riding-Hood, when Red Riding-Hood felt called upon to
remark on them. Dickon stood still and the wheeled chair stopped.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“在哪里？在哪里？那里?”他叫了起来，当小红帽觉得有必要评论他们的时候，他的眼睛就像小红帽里的狼一样大。迪肯站着不动，轮椅停了下来。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“And this,” said Mary, stepping on to the bed close to the ivy,
“is where I went to talk to him when he chirped at me from the top of the
wall. And this is the ivy the wind blew back,” and she took hold of the
hanging green curtain.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“还有这个,”玛丽说，一边走到靠近常春藤的床上，“就是他从墙顶上对我叽叽喳喳的时候我去和他说话的地方。这就是被风吹回来的常春藤,”她抓住挂着的绿色窗帘。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“Oh! is it—is it!” gasped Colin.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“哦! 就是它——就是它!”科林气喘吁吁地说。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“And here is the handle, and here is the door. Dickon push him
in—push him in quickly!”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“这里是把手，这里是门。迪肯把他推进去——快把他推进去!”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
And Dickon did it with one strong, steady, splendid push.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">迪肯用了一个有力的，稳定的，精彩的推力。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
But Colin had actually dropped back against his cushions, even though he gasped
with delight, and he had covered his eyes with his hands and held them there
shutting out everything until they were inside and the chair stopped as if by
magic and the door was closed. Not till then did he take them away and look
round and round and round as Dickon and Mary had done. And over walls and earth
and trees and swinging sprays and tendrils the fair green veil of tender little
leaves had crept, and in the grass under the trees and the gray urns in the
alcoves and here and there everywhere were touches or splashes of gold and
purple and white and the trees were showing pink and snow above his head and
there were fluttering of wings and faint sweet pipes and humming and scents and
scents. And the sun fell warm upon his face like a hand with a lovely touch.
And in wonder Mary and Dickon stood and stared at him. He looked so strange and
different because a pink glow of color had actually crept all over
him—ivory face and neck and hands and all.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">但是科林实际上已经退到了他的靠垫上，尽管他高兴地喘着气，他用手捂住眼睛，把它们挡在外面，直到它们进入里面，椅子停了下来，好像变魔术一样，门关上了。直到那时，他才把他们带走，像狄肯和玛丽那样四处张望。墙壁上，土地上，树木上，摇摆的花朵和卷须上，柔嫩的小叶子爬上了美丽的绿色面纱，在树下的草地上，在壁龛里的灰色骨灰瓮里，到处都是金色、紫色和白色的东西，树木在他的头顶上显示出粉红色和雪，有翅膀的飘动和微弱的甜美的管道，嗡嗡声和气味。阳光温暖地照在他的脸上，就像一只可爱的手。玛丽和狄肯站在那里惊奇地盯着他看。他看起来如此奇怪和不同，因为一种粉红色的光芒实际上爬满了他ーー象牙般的脸，脖子，手和所有。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“I shall get well! I shall get well!” he cried out. “Mary!
Dickon! I shall get well! And I shall live forever and ever and ever!”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“我会好起来的！我会好起来的!”他喊道。“玛丽！迪肯！我会好起来的！我将永远活着，直到永远!”</p>

BEN WEATHERSTAFF</h2>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
One of the strange things about living in the world is that it is only now and
then one is quite sure one is going to live forever and ever and ever. One
knows it sometimes when one gets up at the tender solemn dawn-time and goes out
and stands alone and throws one’s head far back and looks up and up and
watches the pale sky slowly changing and flushing and marvelous unknown things
happening until the East almost makes one cry out and one’s heart stands
still at the strange unchanging majesty of the rising of the sun—which
has been happening every morning for thousands and thousands and thousands of
years. One knows it then for a moment or so. And one knows it sometimes when
one stands by oneself in a wood at sunset and the mysterious deep gold
stillness slanting through and under the branches seems to be saying slowly
again and again something one cannot quite hear, however much one tries. Then
sometimes the immense quiet of the dark blue at night with millions of stars
waiting and watching makes one sure; and sometimes a sound of far-off music
makes it true; and sometimes a look in someone’s eyes.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">生活在这个世界上最奇怪的事情之一就是，只有现在和过去，人们才能确信自己会永远永远永远地活下去。有时候，当你在温柔而庄严的黎明时分起床，独自一人走出去，仰望天空，看着苍白的天空慢慢变化、泛红，看着不可思议的未知事物发生，直到东方几乎让人发出呼喊，看着千百万年来每天早晨一成不变的壮丽太阳升起，你的心静止不动。人们在那一刻或那么一瞬间就知道了。有时候，当你独自一人站在夕阳下的树林里，那神秘而深邃的金色寂静在树枝间斜斜地流淌，似乎在一遍又一遍地缓慢地说着一些你无法完全听到的话，无论你如何尝试。然后，有时深蓝色的夜空中无边无际的寂静，数以百万计的星星在等待和观看，使人确信; 有时，远处的音乐声使人确信; 有时，一个人的眼神使人确信。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
And it was like that with Colin when he first saw and heard and felt the
Springtime inside the four high walls of a hidden garden. That afternoon the
whole world seemed to devote itself to being perfect and radiantly beautiful
and kind to one boy. Perhaps out of pure heavenly goodness the spring came and
crowded everything it possibly could into that one place. More than once Dickon
paused in what he was doing and stood still with a sort of growing wonder in
his eyes, shaking his head softly.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">科林第一次看到、听到、感受到春天的气息就是这样，在一个隐蔽花园的四面高墙里。那天下午，整个世界似乎都致力于对一个男孩变得完美、光彩照人、和蔼可亲。也许出于纯粹的天意，春天来了，把一切可能的东西都挤到了那个地方。狄肯不止一次地停下手中的活儿，站在那儿不动，眼里闪过一丝越来越奇怪的神色，轻轻地摇着头。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“Eh! it is graidely,” he said. “I’m twelve goin’
on thirteen an’ there’s a lot o’ afternoons in thirteen
years, but seems to me like I never seed one as graidely as this
’ere.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“呃！这是渐进的。”。“我十二岁快十三岁了，十三年里有很多个下午，但在我看来，似乎我从来没有像现在这样平静地播种过。”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“Aye, it is a graidely one,” said Mary, and she sighed for mere
joy. “I’ll warrant it’s the graidelest one as ever was in
this world.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“是啊，这是一个庄严的一个,”玛丽说，她只是高兴地叹了口气。“我保证这是世界上最大的一个”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“Does tha’ think,” said Colin with dreamy carefulness,
“as happen it was made loike this ’ere all o’ purpose for
me?”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“你认为,”科林带着梦幻般的小心翼翼地说，“这一切碰巧都是为了我而设计的吗?”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“My word!” cried Mary admiringly, “that there is a bit
o’ good Yorkshire. Tha’rt shapin’ first-rate—that
tha’ art.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“我的天哪!”玛丽羡慕地喊道，“这儿有一点儿好的约克郡。那儿的形状真是一流——那就是你的艺术。”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
And delight reigned.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">喜悦占据了一切。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
They drew the chair under the plum-tree, which was snow-white with blossoms and
musical with bees. It was like a king’s canopy, a fairy king’s.
There were flowering cherry-trees near and apple-trees whose buds were pink and
white, and here and there one had burst open wide. Between the blossoming
branches of the canopy bits of blue sky looked down like wonderful eyes.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">他们把椅子拉到梅树下，梅树是雪白的，开着花，蜜蜂在上面歌唱。它就像一个国王的华盖，一个精灵国王的。附近有开花的樱桃树和苹果树，它们的花蕾是粉红色和白色的，到处都有一棵开得很大。在盛开的树枝之间，蓝色的天空像一双美丽的眼睛向下望去。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
Mary and Dickon worked a little here and there and Colin watched them. They
brought him things to look at—buds which were opening, buds which were
tight closed, bits of twig whose leaves were just showing green, the feather of
a woodpecker which had dropped on the grass, the empty shell of some bird early
hatched. Dickon pushed the chair slowly round and round the garden, stopping
every other moment to let him look at wonders springing out of the earth or
trailing down from trees. It was like being taken in state round the country of
a magic king and queen and shown all the mysterious riches it contained.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">玛丽和迪肯到处工作一会儿，科林看着他们。他们带来了一些东西给他看——正在开放的花蕾，紧闭的花蕾，刚刚露出绿色叶子的小树枝，落在草地上的啄木鸟的羽毛，一些早期孵化的鸟的空壳。迪肯慢慢地把椅子推到花园里，一圈又一圈，隔一会儿就停下来，让他看看从土里冒出来的奇观，或者从树上拖下来的奇观。这就像是在一个魔法国王和王后的国家周围展示它所包含的所有神秘财富。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“I wonder if we shall see the robin?” said Colin.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“我想知道我们是否能看到知更鸟?”科林说。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“Tha’ll see him often enow after a bit,” answered Dickon.
“When th’ eggs hatches out th’ little chap he’ll be
kep’ so busy it’ll make his head swim. Tha’ll see him
flyin’ backward an’ for’ard carryin’ worms nigh as big
as himsel’ an’ that much noise goin’ on in th’ nest
when he gets there as fair flusters him so as he scarce knows which big mouth
to drop th’ first piece in. An’ gapin’ beaks an’
squawks on every side. Mother says as when she sees th’ work a robin has
to keep them gapin’ beaks filled, she feels like she was a lady with
nothin’ to do. She says she’s seen th’ little chaps when it
seemed like th’ sweat must be droppin’ off ’em, though folk
can’t see it.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“过一会儿你就会经常见到他了,”狄肯回答说。“当蛋孵出小家伙时，他会忙得头晕目眩”。你会看到他向后飞，带着和他差不多大的虫子在巢里发出那么大的声音当他到达那里的时候，他很慌乱因为他几乎不知道该把第一块塞进哪个大嘴巴里。到处都是张开的嘴和嘎嘎的叫声。母亲说，当她看到这份工作时，知更鸟必须让它们张开的嘴里塞满食物，她觉得自己是一个无所事事的女士。她说她见过这些小家伙，他们看起来一定是在流汗，尽管人们看不到。”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
This made them giggle so delightedly that they were obliged to cover their
mouths with their hands, remembering that they must not be heard. Colin had
been instructed as to the law of whispers and low voices several days before.
He liked the mysteriousness of it and did his best, but in the midst of excited
enjoyment it is rather difficult never to laugh above a whisper.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">这使他们高兴地咯咯笑起来，他们不得不用手捂住嘴巴，记住不能让别人听到他们的声音。几天前，科林已经学会了低语和低声说话的规律。他喜欢这种神秘的感觉，并且尽了最大的努力，但是在兴奋的享受中，要笑得胜过耳语是相当困难的。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
Every moment of the afternoon was full of new things and every hour the
sunshine grew more golden. The wheeled chair had been drawn back under the
canopy and Dickon had sat down on the grass and had just drawn out his pipe
when Colin saw something he had not had time to notice before.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">下午的每一刻都充满了新鲜事物，每一个小时的阳光都变得更加灿烂。轮椅已经拉回到天篷下，迪肯坐在草地上，刚刚抽完烟斗，科林看到了一些他以前没有时间注意到的东西。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“That’s a very old tree over there, isn’t it?” he said.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“那边有一棵很老的树，不是吗?”他说。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
Dickon looked across the grass at the tree and Mary looked and there was a
brief moment of stillness.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">迪肯透过草地看着那棵树，玛丽也看着，有一阵短暂的寂静。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“Yes,” answered Dickon, after it, and his low voice had a very
gentle sound.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“是的,”狄肯回答，在它之后，和他的低沉的声音有一个非常温和的声音。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
Mary gazed at the tree and thought.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">玛丽凝视着那棵树，思索着。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“The branches are quite gray and there’s not a single leaf
anywhere,” Colin went on. “It’s quite dead, isn’t
it?”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“树枝是灰色的，到处都没有一片叶子,”科林接着说，“它死气沉沉的，不是吗?”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“Aye,” admitted Dickon. “But them roses as has climbed all
over it will near hide every bit o’ th’ dead wood when
they’re full o’ leaves an’ flowers. It won’t look dead
then. It’ll be th’ prettiest of all.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“是的,”迪肯承认。“但是这些玫瑰爬满了整个树林，当它们长满了叶子和花朵时，它们几乎可以隐藏所有的枯木。那样看起来就不会死了。这将是最美丽的</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
Mary still gazed at the tree and thought.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">玛丽仍然凝视着那棵树，心里想着。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“It looks as if a big branch had been broken off,” said Colin.
“I wonder how it was done.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“看起来好像一根大树枝被折断了,”科林说，“我想知道这是怎么做到的。”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“It’s been done many a year,” answered Dickon.
“Eh!” with a sudden relieved start and laying his hand on Colin.
“Look at that robin! There he is! He’s been foragin’ for his
mate.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“已经做了很多年了,”迪肯回答说。“呃!”突然松了一口气，把手放在科林身上。“看那只知更鸟！他在那儿！他一直在找他的伴侣</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
Colin was almost too late but he just caught sight of him, the flash of
red-breasted bird with something in his beak. He darted through the greenness
and into the close-grown corner and was out of sight. Colin leaned back on his
cushion again, laughing a little.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">科林几乎是太晚了，但他刚刚看到他，闪光的红胸鸟在他的嘴里的东西。他飞快地穿过一片绿地，来到一个矮小的角落，消失在人们的视线之外。科林又靠在靠垫上，笑了笑。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“He’s taking her tea to her. Perhaps it’s five o’clock.
I think I’d like some tea myself.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“他正在给她送茶。也许已经五点了。我想我自己也想喝点茶。”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
And so they were safe.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">所以他们很安全。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“It was Magic which sent the robin,” said Mary secretly to Dickon
afterward. “I know it was Magic.” For both she and Dickon had been
afraid Colin might ask something about the tree whose branch had broken off ten
years ago and they had talked it over together and Dickon had stood and rubbed
his head in a troubled way.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“是魔法把知更鸟送来的,”玛丽后来偷偷地对迪肯说。“我知道是魔法”因为她和迪肯都担心科林会问起十年前那棵树的事情，那棵树的树枝已经折断了，他们一起讨论过了，迪肯站在那儿，用一种不安的方式揉着他的头。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“We mun look as if it wasn’t no different from th’ other
trees,” he had said. “We couldn’t never tell him how it
broke, poor lad. If he says anything about it we mun—we mun try to look
cheerful.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“我们看起来好像和其他树没有什么不同,”他说。我们永远不能告诉他它是怎么坏的，可怜的孩子。如果他说起这件事，我们会说——我们会努力让自己看起来很高兴。”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“Aye, that we mun,” had answered Mary.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">玛丽回答说: “是啊，那我们走吧。”。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
But she had not felt as if she looked cheerful when she gazed at the tree. She
wondered and wondered in those few moments if there was any reality in that
other thing Dickon had said. He had gone on rubbing his rust-red hair in a
puzzled way, but a nice comforted look had begun to grow in his blue eyes.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">但是，当她凝视着那棵树时，她并没有觉得自己看起来很高兴。在那短短的几分钟里，她不知道迪肯说的另一件事是否真实。他继续不解地揉着自己铁锈红的头发，但是他那蓝色的眼睛里已经开始生出一种令人欣慰的神情。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“Mrs. Craven was a very lovely young lady,” he had gone on rather
hesitatingly. “An’ mother she thinks maybe she’s about
Misselthwaite many a time lookin’ after Mester Colin, same as all mothers
do when they’re took out o’ th’ world. They have to come
back, tha’ sees. Happen she’s been in the garden an’ happen
it was her set us to work, an’ told us to bring him here.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“克雷文太太是一位非常可爱的年轻女士,”他有些犹豫地继续说道。“她的母亲认为她可能是米瑟斯韦特很多时候照顾科林先生，就像所有的母亲一样，当她们被带到外面的世界。他们必须回来，你看。碰巧她在花园里碰巧是她让我们干活的，让我们把他带到这儿来。”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
Mary had thought he meant something about Magic. She was a great believer in
Magic. Secretly she quite believed that Dickon worked Magic, of course good
Magic, on everything near him and that was why people liked him so much and
wild creatures knew he was their friend. She wondered, indeed, if it were not
possible that his gift had brought the robin just at the right moment when
Colin asked that dangerous question. She felt that his Magic was working all
the afternoon and making Colin look like an entirely different boy. It did not
seem possible that he could be the crazy creature who had screamed and beaten
and bitten his pillow. Even his ivory whiteness seemed to change. The faint
glow of color which had shown on his face and neck and hands when he first got
inside the garden really never quite died away. He looked as if he were made of
flesh instead of ivory or wax.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">玛丽以为他说的是魔术师。她是魔法的忠实信徒。私下里，她相信迪肯对魔术，当然是好魔术，对他身边的一切都很有用，这就是为什么人们那么喜欢他，野生动物知道他是他们的朋友。事实上，她想知道，当科林问出那个危险的问题时，他的礼物是否恰好把知更鸟带来了。她觉得他的魔法整个下午都在发挥作用，让科林看起来像是一个完全不同的男孩。他似乎不可能是那个尖叫、殴打和咬他枕头的疯子。甚至他的象牙白似乎也发生了变化。当他第一次走进花园的时候，他的脸、脖子和手上所显示的那种淡淡的颜色的光芒确实一直没有完全消失。他看起来就像是肉做的，而不是象牙或者蜡做的。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
They saw the robin carry food to his mate two or three times, and it was so
suggestive of afternoon tea that Colin felt they must have some.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">他们看到知更鸟两三次把食物带给它的伴侣，这是如此暗示下午茶，科林觉得他们必须有一些。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“Go and make one of the men servants bring some in a basket to the
rhododendron walk,” he said. “And then you and Dickon can bring it
here.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">他说: “去叫一个男仆把一些装在篮子里的东西拿到杜鹃花园去。”。“然后你和迪肯可以把它带到这里。”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
It was an agreeable idea, easily carried out, and when the white cloth was
spread upon the grass, with hot tea and buttered toast and crumpets, a
delightfully hungry meal was eaten, and several birds on domestic errands
paused to inquire what was going on and were led into investigating crumbs with
great activity. Nut and Shell whisked up trees with pieces of cake and Soot
took the entire half of a buttered crumpet into a corner and pecked at and
examined and turned it over and made hoarse remarks about it until he decided
to swallow it all joyfully in one gulp.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">这是一个令人愉快的想法，很容易实现，当白布铺在草地上，与热茶，奶油吐司和松饼，一个令人愉快的饥饿的饭菜被吃，几个家务鸟停下来询问发生了什么事，并被引导到调查面包屑的巨大活动。坚果和壳牌用蛋糕搅拌树木，苏特把整个半个黄油松饼拿到一个角落里，啄了啄，检查了一遍，翻过来，说了一些粗哑的话，直到他决定快乐地一口吞下。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
The afternoon was dragging towards its mellow hour. The sun was deepening the
gold of its lances, the bees were going home and the birds were flying past
less often. Dickon and Mary were sitting on the grass, the tea-basket was
repacked ready to be taken back to the house, and Colin was lying against his
cushions with his heavy locks pushed back from his forehead and his face
looking quite a natural color.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">这个下午慢慢地走向了它的圆润时刻。太阳正在加深它的长矛的金色，蜜蜂正在回家，鸟儿也越来越少地飞过。迪肯和玛丽坐在草地上，茶篮已经重新打包好准备带回家，科林躺在靠垫上，厚重的头发从前额向后梳着，他的脸看起来很自然。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“I don’t want this afternoon to go,” he said; “but I
shall come back tomorrow, and the day after, and the day after, and the day
after.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“我不想今天下午去,”他说，“但我明天、后天、后天、后天都会回来。”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“You’ll get plenty of fresh air, won’t you?” said Mary.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“你会呼吸到很多新鲜空气的，是吗?”玛丽说。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“I’m going to get nothing else,” he answered.
“I’ve seen the spring now and I’m going to see the summer.
I’m going to see everything grow here. I’m going to grow here
myself.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“我什么也得不到,”他回答。“我已经看到了春天，我要去看看夏天。我要看着这里的一切成长。我要自己在这里成长。”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“That tha’ will,” said Dickon. “Us’ll have thee
walkin’ about here an’ diggin’ same as other folk afore
long.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“那好吧,”狄肯说，“不久以后，我们就让你在这儿四处走动，像其他人一样挖掘。”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
Colin flushed tremendously.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">科林脸红得厉害。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“Walk!” he said. “Dig! Shall I?”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“走!”他说。“挖! 我可以吗?”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
Dickon’s glance at him was delicately cautious. Neither he nor Mary had
ever asked if anything was the matter with his legs.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">迪肯看了他一眼，显得非常谨慎。他和玛丽都没有问过他的腿是不是有什么毛病。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“For sure tha’ will,” he said stoutly.
“Tha—tha’s got legs o’ thine own, same as other
folks!”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“你一定会的,”他坚定地说，“你有你自己的腿，和其他人一样!”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
Mary was rather frightened until she heard Colin’s answer.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">玛丽非常害怕，直到听到科林的回答。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“Nothing really ails them,” he said, “but they are so thin
and weak. They shake so that I’m afraid to try to stand on them.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“没有什么真正使他们生病,”他说，“但是他们又瘦又弱。它们抖得我都不敢站在上面了。”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
Both Mary and Dickon drew a relieved breath.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">玛丽和迪肯都松了一口气。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“When tha’ stops bein’ afraid tha’lt stand on
’em,” Dickon said with renewed cheer. “An’ tha’lt
stop bein’ afraid in a bit.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“当你不再害怕它站在他们身上的时候,”迪肯再次欢呼起来。“一会儿就不会再害怕了”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“I shall?” said Colin, and he lay still as if he were wondering
about things.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“我会吗?”科林说，他静静地躺着，好像在思索着什么。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
They were really very quiet for a little while. The sun was dropping lower. It
was that hour when everything stills itself, and they really had had a busy and
exciting afternoon. Colin looked as if he were resting luxuriously. Even the
creatures had ceased moving about and had drawn together and were resting near
them. Soot had perched on a low branch and drawn up one leg and dropped the
gray film drowsily over his eyes. Mary privately thought he looked as if he
might snore in a minute.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">他们安静了一会儿。太阳越来越低。就是那个时候，一切都静止了，他们真的度过了一个忙碌而令人兴奋的下午。科林看上去好像正在豪华地休息。甚至那些生物也停止了活动，聚集在一起，在他们附近休息。烟灰栖息在一根矮树枝上，抬起一条腿，昏昏欲睡地把灰色的薄膜盖在他的眼睛上。玛丽私下里觉得他看起来好像马上就要打鼾了。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
In the midst of this stillness it was rather startling when Colin half lifted
his head and exclaimed in a loud suddenly alarmed whisper:
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">在这一片寂静中，科林半抬起头，突然惊恐地大声低声说:</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“Who is that man?”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“那个人是谁?”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
Dickon and Mary scrambled to their feet.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">迪肯和玛丽慌忙站了起来。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“Man!” they both cried in low quick voices.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“伙计!”他们都用低而快的声音喊道。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
Colin pointed to the high wall.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">科林指着高墙。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“Look!” he whispered excitedly. “Just look!”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“快看!”他激动地低声说，“快看!”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
Mary and Dickon wheeled about and looked. There was Ben Weatherstaff’s
indignant face glaring at them over the wall from the top of a ladder! He
actually shook his fist at Mary.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">玛丽和狄肯转过身来，四处张望。那是本 · 威瑟斯塔夫愤怒的脸从梯子顶端越过墙面怒视着他们！他真的对玛丽挥了挥拳头。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“If I wasn’t a bachelder, an’ tha’ was a wench o’
mine,” he cried, “I’d give thee a hidin’!”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“如果我不是个单身汉，那你就是我的姑娘,”他喊道，“我会让你躲起来!”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
He mounted another step threateningly as if it were his energetic intention to
jump down and deal with her; but as she came toward him he evidently thought
better of it and stood on the top step of his ladder shaking his fist down at
her.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">他又向前迈了一步，威胁似的，好像是要跳下去对付她; 但是当她向他走来时，他显然想通了，站在梯子的最高一级，向她挥舞着拳头。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“I never thowt much o’ thee!” he harangued. “I
couldna’ abide thee th’ first time I set eyes on thee. A scrawny
buttermilk-faced young besom, allus askin’ questions an’
pokin’ tha’ nose where it wasna, wanted. I never knowed how
tha’ got so thick wi’ me. If it hadna’ been for th’
robin— Drat him—”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“我从来没有对你说过这么多!”他高谈阔论。“我第一次见到你的时候，我不能容忍你。一个瘦骨嶙峋的乳臭未干的年轻女人，总是问问题，到处打探消息。我从来不知道你怎么跟我这么亲密。如果不是为了那只知更鸟，该死的</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“Ben Weatherstaff,” called out Mary, finding her breath. She stood
below him and called up to him with a sort of gasp. “Ben Weatherstaff, it
was the robin who showed me the way!”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“本 · 韦瑟斯塔夫,”玛丽喘着气喊道。她站在他下面，喘着气向他呼喊。“ Ben Weatherstaff 是知更鸟给我指的路!”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
Then it did seem as if Ben really would scramble down on her side of the wall,
he was so outraged.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">然后看起来本真的会从她那边的墙上爬下来，他是如此的愤怒。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“Tha’ young bad ’un!” he called down at her.
“Layin’ tha’ badness on a robin—not but what he’s
impidint enow for anythin’. Him showin’ thee th’ way! Him!
Eh! tha’ young nowt”—she could see his next words burst out
because he was overpowered by curiosity—“however i’ this
world did tha’ get in?”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“你这小坏蛋!”他朝她喊道。“把你的邪恶放在知更鸟身上”“不是放在它身上，而是放在它现在无法做任何事情的地方”。他在给你指路！就是他！呃！“你这个小不点儿”ーー她可以看到他接下来的话突然冒出来，因为他被好奇心征服了ーー“不管这个世界是怎么进来的?”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“It was the robin who showed me the way,” she protested
obstinately. “He didn’t know he was doing it but he did. And I
can’t tell you from here while you’re shaking your fist at
me.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“是知更鸟给我指的路,”她顽固地抗议道。“他不知道自己在做什么，但他做到了。在这里我不能告诉你，当你对我挥拳头的时候</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
He stopped shaking his fist very suddenly at that very moment and his jaw
actually dropped as he stared over her head at something he saw coming over the
grass toward him.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">就在那一刻，他突然停止了挥动拳头，当他从她头顶上方看到有什么东西从草地上向他走来时，他的下巴竟然张得老大。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
At the first sound of his torrent of words Colin had been so surprised that he
had only sat up and listened as if he were spellbound. But in the midst of it
he had recovered himself and beckoned imperiously to Dickon.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">他滔滔不绝的话一出口，科林就感到非常惊讶，他只是坐起来听着，好像着了魔似的。但在这过程中，他已经恢复过来，专横地向狄肯招手。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“Wheel me over there!” he commanded. “Wheel me quite close
and stop right in front of him!”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“把我推到那边去!”他命令道。“把我推到离他很近的地方，然后在他面前停下来!”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
And this, if you please, this is what Ben Weatherstaff beheld and which made
his jaw drop. A wheeled chair with luxurious cushions and robes which came
toward him looking rather like some sort of State Coach because a young Rajah
leaned back in it with royal command in his great black-rimmed eyes and a thin
white hand extended haughtily toward him. And it stopped right under Ben
Weatherstaff’s nose. It was really no wonder his mouth dropped open.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">还有这个，如果你愿意的话，这就是 Ben Weatherstaff 看到的让他目瞪口呆的东西。一把带着豪华靠垫和长袍的轮椅向他走来，看起来有点像某种国家教练，因为一个年轻的国王斜靠在轮椅上，黑框大眼睛里带着皇室的命令，一只白色的瘦手傲慢地向他伸出。就在 Ben Weatherstaff 的眼皮底下。难怪他张大了嘴巴。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“Do you know who I am?” demanded the Rajah.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“你知道我是谁吗?”国王问道。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
How Ben Weatherstaff stared! His red old eyes fixed themselves on what was
before him as if he were seeing a ghost. He gazed and gazed and gulped a lump
down his throat and did not say a word.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">本 · 韦瑟斯塔夫瞪得多大啊！他那双红红的老眼睛定定地看着眼前的一切，仿佛看见了一个鬼魂。他凝视着，凝视着，咽了咽喉咙里的一块东西，一句话也没说。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“Do you know who I am?” demanded Colin still more imperiously.
“Answer!”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“你知道我是谁吗?”科林更加专横地问道。“回答我!”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
Ben Weatherstaff put his gnarled hand up and passed it over his eyes and over
his forehead and then he did answer in a queer shaky voice.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">本 · 韦瑟斯塔夫举起他那只粗糙的手，把它递过眼睛和额头，然后用一种奇怪的颤抖的声音回答了。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“Who tha’ art?” he said. “Aye, that I
do—wi’ tha’ mother’s eyes starin’ at me out
o’ tha’ face. Lord knows how tha’ come here. But tha’rt
th’ poor cripple.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“你是谁?”他说。“是的，我是这样做的，用你妈妈的眼睛从你的脸上看着我。天知道你是怎么来的。可是那个可怜的瘸子</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
Colin forgot that he had ever had a back. His face flushed scarlet and he sat
bolt upright.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">科林忘记了他曾经有过一个背。他的脸涨得通红，他笔直地坐了起来。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“I’m not a cripple!” he cried out furiously. “I’m
not!”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“我不是瘸子!”他愤怒地喊道。“我不是!”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“He’s not!” cried Mary, almost shouting up the wall in her
fierce indignation. “He’s not got a lump as big as a pin! I looked
and there was none there—not one!”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“他不是!”玛丽气得几乎要冲着墙喊叫起来。“他没有大头针那么大的肿块！我一看，什么也没有，一个也没有!”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
Ben Weatherstaff passed his hand over his forehead again and gazed as if he
could never gaze enough. His hand shook and his mouth shook and his voice
shook. He was an ignorant old man and a tactless old man and he could only
remember the things he had heard.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">本 · 韦瑟斯塔夫又把手放在额头上，凝视着，好像永远也凝视不够似的。他的手在颤抖，他的嘴在颤抖，他的声音在颤抖。他是一个无知的老人，一个不老练的老人，他只记得他听到的事情。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“Tha’—tha’ hasn’t got a crooked back?” he
said hoarsely.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“你——你没有驼背吧?”他沙哑地说。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“No!” shouted Colin.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“不!”科林喊道。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“Tha’—tha’ hasn’t got crooked legs?”
quavered Ben more hoarsely yet.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“你的腿没有歪吧?”本的声音更加沙哑了。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
It was too much. The strength which Colin usually threw into his tantrums
rushed through him now in a new way. Never yet had he been accused of crooked
legs—even in whispers—and the perfectly simple belief in their
existence which was revealed by Ben Weatherstaff’s voice was more than
Rajah flesh and blood could endure. His anger and insulted pride made him
forget everything but this one moment and filled him with a power he had never
known before, an almost unnatural strength.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">太过分了。科林平时发脾气的力量现在以一种新的方式冲击着他。从来没有人指责过他的腿是弯曲的ーー即使是在耳语中ーー而且从本 · 韦瑟斯塔夫的声音中透露出来的对他们存在的完全简单的信念，是拉贾的血肉之躯所无法忍受的。他的愤怒和被侮辱的骄傲使他忘记了一切，除了这一刻，并且使他充满了一种他从来不知道的力量，一种几乎不自然的力量。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“Come here!” he shouted to Dickon, and he actually began to tear
the coverings off his lower limbs and disentangle himself. “Come here!
Come here! This minute!”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“过来!”他向迪肯喊道，然后他开始撕掉下肢的衣服，解开自己的手铐。“过来！过来！就现在!”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
Dickon was by his side in a second. Mary caught her breath in a short gasp and
felt herself turn pale.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">迪肯马上就到了他身边。玛丽喘了一口气，觉得自己脸色发白。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“He can do it! He can do it! He can do it! He can!” she gabbled
over to herself under her breath as fast as ever she could.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“他能做到！他可以的！他可以的！他可以!”她以最快的速度喃喃自语。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
There was a brief fierce scramble, the rugs were tossed on the ground, Dickon
held Colin’s arm, the thin legs were out, the thin feet were on the
grass. Colin was standing upright—upright—as straight as an arrow
and looking strangely tall—his head thrown back and his strange eyes
flashing lightning.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">有一个短暂的激烈的争夺，地毯被扔在地上，迪肯抓住科林的胳膊，瘦腿是出来的，瘦脚是在草地上。科林站得笔直ーー笔直ーー像箭一样笔直，看起来高得出奇ーー他的头向后仰，他那双奇怪的眼睛闪烁着电光。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“Look at me!” he flung up at Ben Weatherstaff. “Just look at
me—you! Just look at me!”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“看着我!”他猛地朝本 · 韦瑟斯塔夫喊道，“看着我——你! 看着我!”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“He’s as straight as I am!” cried Dickon. “He’s
as straight as any lad i’ Yorkshire!”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“他和我一样直!”迪肯喊道。“他和约克郡的其他小伙子一样直!”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
What Ben Weatherstaff did Mary thought queer beyond measure. He choked and
gulped and suddenly tears ran down his weather-wrinkled cheeks as he struck his
old hands together.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">本 · 韦瑟斯塔夫做了什么，玛丽觉得奇怪得不可思议。他哽咽着，吞咽着，突然泪水顺着他布满皱纹的脸颊流下来，双手合十。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“Eh!” he burst forth, “th’ lies folk tells!
Tha’rt as thin as a lath an’ as white as a wraith, but
there’s not a knob on thee. Tha’lt make a mon yet. God bless
thee!”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“呃!”他爆发出来，“这是民间的谎言！你瘦得像条木条，白得像个幽灵，但你身上却没有一个把手。这样还不错。上帝保佑你!”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
Dickon held Colin’s arm strongly but the boy had not begun to falter. He
stood straighter and straighter and looked Ben Weatherstaff in the face.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">迪肯紧紧地抓住科林的胳膊，但是这个男孩还没有开始动摇。他站得越来越直，直视着本 · 韦瑟斯塔夫的脸。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“I’m your master,” he said, “when my father is away.
And you are to obey me. This is my garden. Don’t dare to say a word about
it! You get down from that ladder and go out to the Long Walk and Miss Mary
will meet you and bring you here. I want to talk to you. We did not want you,
but now you will have to be in the secret. Be quick!”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“我是你的主人,”他说，“当我父亲不在的时候。你必须服从我。这是我的花园。一个字都不要说！你从梯子上下来，去长途步行玛丽小姐会带你来这里。我想跟你谈谈。我们不想要你，但现在你必须在秘密。快点!”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
Ben Weatherstaff’s crabbed old face was still wet with that one queer
rush of tears. It seemed as if he could not take his eyes from thin straight
Colin standing on his feet with his head thrown back.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">本 · 韦瑟斯塔夫苍老的脸上还挂着一阵奇怪的泪水。他似乎无法把视线从瘦削笔直的科林身上移开，他正仰着头站着。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“Eh! lad,” he almost whispered. “Eh! my lad!” And then
remembering himself he suddenly touched his hat gardener fashion and said,
“Yes, sir! Yes, sir!” and obediently disappeared as he descended
the ladder.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“呃！“小伙子,”他几乎低声说。“呃！我的孩子!”然后他想起了自己，他突然摸了摸他的帽子园丁时尚，说: “是的，先生！是，长官!”顺从地走下梯子。</p>

WHEN THE SUN WENT DOWN<font class="cyxy-trs-target"> 当太阳下山的时候</font></h2>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
When his head was out of sight Colin turned to Mary.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">当他的头看不见时，科林转向玛丽。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“Go and meet him,” he said; and Mary flew across the grass to the
door under the ivy.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“去见见他,”他说，玛丽飞过草地，来到常春藤下的门口。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
Dickon was watching him with sharp eyes. There were scarlet spots on his cheeks
and he looked amazing, but he showed no signs of falling.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">迪肯用锐利的目光注视着他。他的脸颊上有红色的斑点，看起来很惊人，但是他没有摔倒的迹象。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“I can stand,” he said, and his head was still held up and he said
it quite grandly.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“我能站起来,”他说，他的头仍然抬着，他说得相当隆重。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“I told thee tha’ could as soon as tha’ stopped bein’
afraid,” answered Dickon. “An’ tha’s stopped.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“我告诉过你，只要你不再害怕，你就能做到,”狄肯回答说，“而且你已经不害怕了。”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“Yes, I’ve stopped,” said Colin.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“是的，我停下来了,”科林说。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
Then suddenly he remembered something Mary had said.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">然后他突然想起玛丽说过的话。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“Are you making Magic?” he asked sharply.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“你在制作《魔法》吗?”他尖锐地问道。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
Dickon’s curly mouth spread in a cheerful grin.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">迪肯的卷唇张开，露出一个愉快的笑容。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“Tha’s doin’ Magic thysel’,” he said.
“It’s same Magic as made these ’ere work out o’
th’ earth,” and he touched with his thick boot a clump of crocuses
in the grass.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“你在做‘神奇的百里香’,”他说。“就是这种魔法让这些番红花在地球上生根发芽的,”他用他那只厚靴子在草丛中摸了摸一丛番红花。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
Colin looked down at them.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">科林低头看着他们。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“Aye,” he said slowly, “there couldna’ be bigger Magic
than that there—there couldna’ be.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“是啊,”他慢慢地说，“不可能有比这更大的魔法了，不可能有。”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
He drew himself up straighter than ever.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">他把自己画得比以往任何时候都笔直。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“I’m going to walk to that tree,” he said, pointing to one a
few feet away from him. “I’m going to be standing when Weatherstaff
comes here. I can rest against the tree if I like. When I want to sit down I
will sit down, but not before. Bring a rug from the chair.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“我要走向那棵树,”他说，指着几英尺外的一棵树。”韦瑟斯塔夫来的时候，我会站在这里。如果我愿意，我可以靠在树上休息。当我想坐下的时候，我会坐下来，但不会提前。把椅子上的地毯拿来</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
He walked to the tree and though Dickon held his arm he was wonderfully steady.
When he stood against the tree trunk it was not too plain that he supported
himself against it, and he still held himself so straight that he looked tall.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">他走到树边，尽管迪肯挽着他的胳膊，他却异常稳定。当他靠着树干站着的时候，并不是很明显，他是靠着树干支撑着自己的，而且他仍然挺直着身子，看上去很高。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
When Ben Weatherstaff came through the door in the wall he saw him standing
there and he heard Mary muttering something under her breath.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">当本 · 韦瑟斯塔夫从墙上的门进来时，他看见他站在那里，他听见玛丽低声喃喃地说着什么。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“What art sayin’?” he asked rather testily because he did not
want his attention distracted from the long thin straight boy figure and proud
face.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“艺术在说什么?”他相当不耐烦地问，因为他不想让自己的注意力从那个瘦长的直男身材和骄傲的脸上分散开来。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
But she did not tell him. What she was saying was this:
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">但是她没有告诉他，她说的是:</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“You can do it! You can do it! I told you you could! You can do it! You
can do it! You <i>can!</i>”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“你能做到！你可以的！我说过你可以的！你可以的！你可以的！你可以的!”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
She was saying it to Colin because she wanted to make Magic and keep him on his
feet looking like that. She could not bear that he should give in before Ben
Weatherstaff. He did not give in. She was uplifted by a sudden feeling that he
looked quite beautiful in spite of his thinness. He fixed his eyes on Ben
Weatherstaff in his funny imperious way.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">她对科林这么说是因为她想让魔术师保持这样的状态。她不能忍受他在本 · 韦瑟斯塔夫面前屈服。他没有屈服。尽管他很瘦，但她突然觉得他看起来很漂亮，这使她感到振奋。他以一种滑稽而专横的方式盯着本 · 韦瑟斯塔夫。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“Look at me!” he commanded. “Look at me all over! Am I a
hunchback? Have I got crooked legs?”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“看着我!”他命令道。“看着我全身! 我是驼背吗? 我的腿是不是弯的?”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
Ben Weatherstaff had not quite got over his emotion, but he had recovered a
little and answered almost in his usual way.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">本 · 韦瑟斯塔夫还没有完全从情绪中恢复过来，但是他已经恢复了一些，并且几乎用他惯常的方式回答了。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“Not tha’,” he said. “Nowt o’ th’ sort.
What’s tha’ been doin’ with thysel’—hidin’
out o’ sight an’ lettin’ folk think tha’ was cripple
an’ half-witted?”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“不是那个,”他说。“不是这样的。你跟你自己在干什么? 躲起来，让别人以为你是个瘸子和笨蛋?”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“Half-witted!” said Colin angrily. “Who thought that?”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“笨蛋!”科林生气地说。“谁想到的?”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“Lots o’ fools,” said Ben. “Th’ world’s
full o’ jackasses brayin’ an’ they never bray nowt but lies.
What did tha’ shut thysel’ up for?”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“很多傻瓜,”本说。“世界上到处都是蠢货，他们只会说谎，什么也不会说”。你为什么要闭嘴?”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“Everyone thought I was going to die,” said Colin shortly.
“I’m not!”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“每个人都以为我要死了,”科林简短地说。“我没有!”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
And he said it with such decision Ben Weatherstaff looked him over, up and
down, down and up.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">他说，这样的决定本韦瑟斯塔夫看了他，上上下下，下来，上来。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“Tha’ die!” he said with dry exultation. “Nowt o’
th’ sort! Tha’s got too much pluck in thee. When I seed thee put
tha’ legs on th’ ground in such a hurry I knowed tha’ was all

orders.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“去死吧!”他兴高采烈地说。“不是这样的！你胆子太大了。当我看见你匆匆忙忙地把腿放在地上时，我知道你一切都好。年轻的先生，请坐在地毯上，给我下命令吧。”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
There was a queer mixture of crabbed tenderness and shrewd understanding in his
manner. Mary had poured out speech as rapidly as she could as they had come
down the Long Walk. The chief thing to be remembered, she had told him, was
that Colin was getting well—getting well. The garden was doing it. No one
must let him remember about having humps and dying.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">他的举止有一种古怪的混合物，既有难以捉摸的温柔，又有精明的理解力。玛丽已经尽可能快地把话说完了，就像他们走过长长的步道一样。她告诉他，最值得记住的是，科林正在康复。是花园在搞鬼。没人能让他记起驼峰和死亡。</p>

“What work do you do in the gardens, Weatherstaff?” he inquired.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“你在花园里做什么工作，威瑟斯塔夫?”他问道。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“Anythin’ I’m told to do,” answered old Ben.
“I’m kep’ on by favor—because she liked me.”

“She?” said Colin.

“Tha’ mother,” answered Ben Weatherstaff.

“My mother?” said Colin, and he looked about him quietly.

“Aye, it was that!” and Ben Weatherstaff looked about him too.
“She were main fond of it.”

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“It is my garden now. I am fond of it. I shall come here every
day,” announced Colin. “But it is to be a secret. My orders are
that no one is to know that we come here. Dickon and my cousin have worked and
made it come alive. I shall send for you sometimes to help—but you must
come when no one can see you.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">现在这是我的花园。我很喜欢。我将每天来这里,”科林宣布。但这是个秘密。我的命令是不能让任何人知道我们来这里。迪肯和我的表弟已经工作，使它活了过来。我有时会派人去请你帮忙，但你必须在没人看见你的时候来。”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
Ben Weatherstaff’s face twisted itself in a dry old smile.

“What!” exclaimed Colin. “When?”

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“Th’ last time I was here,” rubbing his chin and looking
round, “was about two year’ ago.”

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“But no one has been in it for ten years!” cried Colin.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“可是已经十年没有人进去过了!”科林喊道。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“There was no door!”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“没有门!”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“I’m no one,” said old Ben dryly. “An’ I

rheumatics held me back th’ last two year’.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“我谁也不是,”老本干巴巴地说。“我没有穿过那扇门”。我翻过那堵墙。过去两年，风湿病拖了我的后腿。”</p>

“Tha’ come an’ did a bit o’ prunin’!” cried
Dickon. “I couldn’t make out how it had been done.”

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“She was so fond of it—she was!” said Ben Weatherstaff
slowly. “An’ she was such a pretty young thing. She says to me
once, ‘Ben,’ says she laughin’, ‘if ever I’m ill

th’ orders was no one was ever to come nigh. But I come,” with
grumpy obstinacy. “Over th’ wall I come—until th’

She’d gave her order first.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“她非常喜欢它，真的!”本 · 威瑟斯塔夫慢慢地说。她那么年轻漂亮。有一次她对我说，“本,”她笑着说，“如果我生病了或者我离开了，你一定要照顾好我的玫瑰花。”。当她离开的时候，命令是不许任何人靠近。但我还是来了。”。“我翻墙而来ーー直到风湿病阻止了我ーー我每年做一点工作。她先下了命令”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“It wouldn’t have been as wick as it is if tha’ hadn’t
done it,” said Dickon. “I did wonder.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">迪肯说: “如果你没有这么做，那就不会像现在这么糟糕了。我真的很想知道。”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“I’m glad you did it, Weatherstaff,” said Colin.
“You’ll know how to keep the secret.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“我很高兴你这么做了，韦瑟斯塔夫,”科林说，“你会知道如何保守这个秘密的。”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“Aye, I’ll know, sir,” answered Ben. “An’
it’ll be easier for a man wi’ rheumatics to come in at th’

</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“是的，我知道，先生。”本回答。“一个患风湿病的人来这里比较容易”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
On the grass near the tree Mary had dropped her trowel. Colin stretched out his
hand and took it up. An odd expression came into his face and he began to
scratch at the earth. His thin hand was weak enough but presently as they
watched him—Mary with quite breathless interest—he drove the end of
the trowel into the soil and turned some over.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">在树旁边的草地上，玛丽丢下了她的铲子。科林伸出手，把它拿了起来。他脸上露出一种奇怪的表情，开始抓地。他那只瘦弱的手已经足够虚弱了，但是不久，当他们注视着他的时候ーー玛丽兴致勃勃地看着他ーー他把铲子的末端插进土里，把一些铲子翻了过来。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“You can do it! You can do it!” said Mary to herself. “I tell
you, you can!”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“你可以的! 你可以的!”玛丽对自己说。“我告诉你，你可以的!”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
Dickon’s round eyes were full of eager curiousness but he said not a
word. Ben Weatherstaff looked on with interested face.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">狄肯圆圆的眼睛里充满了热切的好奇，但他一句话也没说。本 · 韦瑟斯塔夫饶有兴趣地看着。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
Colin persevered. After he had turned a few trowelfuls of soil he spoke
exultantly to Dickon in his best Yorkshire.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">科林坚持了下来。在他用铲子铲了几铲土之后，他在他最好的约克郡兴高采烈地和迪肯说话。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“Tha’ said as tha’d have me walkin’ about here same as
other folk—an’ tha’ said tha’d have me diggin’. I
thowt tha’ was just leein’ to please me. This is only th’
first day an’ I’ve walked—an’ here I am

</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“你说过你会让我像其他人一样在这里走动，你说过你会让我挖掘。我以为你只是想取悦我。这只是我第一天走路，我在这里挖土。”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
Ben Weatherstaff’s mouth fell open again when he heard him, but he ended
by chuckling.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">本 · 韦瑟斯塔夫听到这话，嘴巴又张开了，但最后还是咯咯地笑了起来。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“Eh!” he said, “that sounds as if tha’d got wits enow.
Tha’rt a Yorkshire lad for sure. An’ tha’rt diggin’,
too. How’d tha’ like to plant a bit o’ somethin’? I can
get thee a rose in a pot.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“呃!”他说“听起来你现在很聪明”。肯定是个约克郡小伙子。而且还在挖。你想不想种点什么？我可以在花盆里给你一朵玫瑰</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“Go and get it!” said Colin, digging excitedly. “Quick!
Quick!”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“去拿来!”科林兴奋地说，“快! 快!”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
It was done quickly enough indeed. Ben Weatherstaff went his way forgetting
rheumatics. Dickon took his spade and dug the hole deeper and wider than a new
digger with thin white hands could make it. Mary slipped out to run and bring
back a watering-can. When Dickon had deepened the hole Colin went on turning
the soft earth over and over. He looked up at the sky, flushed and glowing with
the strangely new exercise, slight as it was.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">确实很快就完成了。Ben Weatherstaff 忘记了风湿病。迪肯拿起他的铁锹，把洞挖得又深又宽，比一个新来的挖掘者用一双瘦削的白手挖出来的还要宽。玛丽溜出去跑步，带回一个喷壶。迪肯把洞挖深了，科林继续把松软的泥土翻了一遍又一遍。他抬头看着天空，脸红了，因为这个奇怪的新活动而发光，尽管它很轻微。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“I want to do it before the sun goes quite—quite down,” he
said.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">他说: “我想在太阳还没有完全落山之前做这件事。”。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
Mary thought that perhaps the sun held back a few minutes just on purpose. Ben
Weatherstaff brought the rose in its pot from the greenhouse. He hobbled over
the grass as fast as he could. He had begun to be excited, too. He knelt down
by the hole and broke the pot from the mould.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">玛丽想，也许太阳是故意拖延了几分钟。本 · 韦瑟斯塔夫从温室里把玫瑰花放在花盆里。他以最快的速度在草地上蹒跚而行。他也开始兴奋起来。他跪在洞边，把壶从霉菌中打破。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“Here, lad,” he said, handing the plant to Colin. “Set it in
the earth thysel’ same as th’ king does when he goes to a new
place.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“给，小伙子,”他说着把植物递给科林。“把它放在土里，就像国王去新地方一样”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
The thin white hands shook a little and Colin’s flush grew deeper as he
set the rose in the mould and held it while old Ben made firm the earth. It was
filled in and pressed down and made steady. Mary was leaning forward on her
hands and knees. Soot had flown down and marched forward to see what was being
done. Nut and Shell chattered about it from a cherry-tree.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">瘦削的白手抖了一下，科林的红晕变得更深了，他把玫瑰放在模具里，拿着它，而老本做坚实的土地。它被填充，压缩，并使稳定。玛丽用手和膝盖向前倾。烟尘飞下来，向前走，看看发生了什么事。坚果和壳牌从一棵樱桃树上聊起了这件事。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“It’s planted!” said Colin at last. “And the sun is
only slipping over the edge. Help me up, Dickon. I want to be standing when it
goes. That’s part of the Magic.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“这是栽赃!”科林最后说。太阳只是从边缘滑落。扶我起来，迪肯。我想站在那里等它消失。这是魔术的一部分。”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
And Dickon helped him, and the Magic—or whatever it was—so gave him
strength that when the sun did slip over the edge and end the strange lovely
afternoon for them there he actually stood on his two feet—laughing.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">狄肯帮助了他，魔法(不管是什么)给了他力量，以至于当太阳从边缘滑落，结束了这个奇怪而美好的下午时，他实际上是站着笑的。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
Dr. Craven had been waiting some time at the house when they returned to it. He
had indeed begun to wonder if it might not be wise to send someone out to
explore the garden paths. When Colin was brought back to his room the poor man
looked him over seriously.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">当他们回到房子时，克雷文医生已经在那里等了一段时间了。他确实开始怀疑派人出去探索花园小径是否明智。当科林被带回他的房间时，那个可怜的人认真地打量着他。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“You should not have stayed so long,” he said. “You must not
overexert yourself.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“你不应该呆这么久,”他说，“你不应该过度劳累。”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“I am not tired at all,” said Colin. “It has made me well.
Tomorrow I am going out in the morning as well as in the afternoon.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“我一点也不累,”科林说。“它让我好起来了。明天我上午出去，下午也出去。”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“I am not sure that I can allow it,” answered Dr. Craven. “I
am afraid it would not be wise.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“我不确定我能允许这样做,”克雷文医生回答说，“恐怕这样做不明智。”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“It would not be wise to try to stop me,” said Colin quite
seriously. “I am going.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“试图阻止我是不明智的,”科林相当严肃地说，“我要去。”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
Even Mary had found out that one of Colin’s chief peculiarities was that
he did not know in the least what a rude little brute he was with his way of
ordering people about. He had lived on a sort of desert island all his life and
as he had been the king of it he had made his own manners and had had no one to
compare himself with. Mary had indeed been rather like him herself and since
she had been at Misselthwaite had gradually discovered that her own manners had
not been of the kind which is usual or popular. Having made this discovery she
naturally thought it of enough interest to communicate to Colin. So she sat and
looked at him curiously for a few minutes after Dr. Craven had gone. She wanted
to make him ask her why she was doing it and of course she did.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">就连玛丽也发现了科林的一个主要特点，那就是他根本不知道自己是个多么粗鲁的小畜生，总是对人指手画脚。他一生都生活在一个荒岛上，因为他是这里的国王，所以他有自己的风度，没有人可以与他相比。玛丽自己也确实很像他，自从她来到 Misselthwaite 后，她逐渐发现自己的举止并不是那种通常或受欢迎的举止。既然发现了这个问题，她自然觉得有足够的兴趣与科林沟通。克雷文医生走后，她坐在那里好奇地看了他几分钟。她想让他问她为什么要这么做，她当然这么做了。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“What are you looking at me for?” he said.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“你看着我干什么?”他说。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“I’m thinking that I am rather sorry for Dr. Craven.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“我在想，我为克雷文医生感到遗憾”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“So am I,” said Colin calmly, but not without an air of some
satisfaction. “He won’t get Misselthwaite at all now I’m not
going to die.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“我也是,”科林平静地说，但是带着一种满足的神情。“他不会得到米瑟斯韦特，现在我不会死了。”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“I’m sorry for him because of that, of course,” said Mary,
“but I was thinking just then that it must have been very horrid to have
had to be polite for ten years to a boy who was always rude. I would never have
done it.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“当然，我为他感到遗憾,”玛丽说，“但是我刚才在想，对一个总是粗鲁的男孩礼貌十年一定是非常可怕的。我绝不会这么做。”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“Am I rude?” Colin inquired undisturbedly.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“我很粗鲁吗?”科林平静地问。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“If you had been his own boy and he had been a slapping sort of
man,” said Mary, “he would have slapped you.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“如果你是他自己的孩子，他是那种会扇耳光的人,”玛丽说，“他会扇你耳光的。”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“But he daren’t,” said Colin.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“可是他不敢,”科林说。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“No, he daren’t,” answered Mistress Mary, thinking the thing
out quite without prejudice. “Nobody ever dared to do anything you
didn’t like—because you were going to die and things like that. You
were such a poor thing.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“不，他不敢,”玛丽太太回答，毫无偏见地想了想。“从来没有人敢做任何你不喜欢的事情ーー因为你就要死了之类的事情。你太可怜了”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“But,” announced Colin stubbornly, “I am not going to be a
poor thing. I won’t let people think I’m one. I stood on my feet
this afternoon.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“但是,”科林固执地宣布，“我不会成为一个可怜的东西。我不会让别人以为我是。我今天下午站起来了。”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“It is always having your own way that has made you so queer,” Mary
went on, thinking aloud.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“总是有自己的方式使你变得如此古怪,”玛丽继续说，大声思考着。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
Colin turned his head, frowning.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">科林转过头，皱着眉头。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“Am I queer?” he demanded.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“我是同性恋吗?”他质问道。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“Yes,” answered Mary, “very. But you needn’t be
cross,” she added impartially, “because so am I queer—and so
is Ben Weatherstaff. But I am not as queer as I was before I began to like
people and before I found the garden.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“是的,”玛丽回答，“非常喜欢。但你不必生气,”她不偏不倚地补充道，“因为我也是同性恋ーー本 · 韦瑟斯塔夫也是。但我不像开始喜欢别人之前那样古怪了，也不像发现花园之前那样古怪了。”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“I don’t want to be queer,” said Colin. “I am not going
to be,” and he frowned again with determination.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“我不想变成同性恋,”科林说。“我不会变成同性恋的,”他又坚决地皱起眉头。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
He was a very proud boy. He lay thinking for a while and then Mary saw his
beautiful smile begin and gradually change his whole face.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">他是个非常骄傲的孩子。他躺在床上想了一会儿，然后玛丽看到他美丽的微笑开始了，渐渐地改变了他的整张脸。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“I shall stop being queer,” he said, “if I go every day to
the garden. There is Magic in there—good Magic, you know, Mary. I am sure
there is.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“如果我每天去花园,”他说，“我就不再是怪人了。里面有魔法，好魔法，你知道的，玛丽。我相信肯定有。”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“So am I,” said Mary.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“我也是,”玛丽说。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“Even if it isn’t real Magic,” Colin said, “we can
pretend it is. <i>Something</i> is there—<i>something!</i>”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“即使它不是真正的魔术,”科林说，“我们也可以假装它是。那里有东西ーー有东西!”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“It’s Magic,” said Mary, “but not black. It’s as
white as snow.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“这是魔法,”玛丽说，“但不是黑色的。它像雪一样白。”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
They always called it Magic and indeed it seemed like it in the months that
followed—the wonderful months—the radiant months—the amazing
ones. Oh! the things which happened in that garden! If you have never had a
garden you cannot understand, and if you have had a garden you will know that
it would take a whole book to describe all that came to pass there. At first it
seemed that green things would never cease pushing their way through the earth,
in the grass, in the beds, even in the crevices of the walls. Then the green
things began to show buds and the buds began to unfurl and show color, every
shade of blue, every shade of purple, every tint and hue of crimson. In its
happy days flowers had been tucked away into every inch and hole and corner.
Ben Weatherstaff had seen it done and had himself scraped out mortar from
between the bricks of the wall and made pockets of earth for lovely clinging
things to grow on. Iris and white lilies rose out of the grass in sheaves, and
the green alcoves filled themselves with amazing armies of the blue and white
flower lances of tall delphiniums or columbines or campanulas.

“She was main fond o’ them—she was,” Ben Weatherstaff

The seeds Dickon and Mary had planted grew as if fairies had tended them.
Satiny poppies of all tints danced in the breeze by the score, gaily defying
flowers which had lived in the garden for years and which it might be confessed
seemed rather to wonder how such new people had got there. And the
roses—the roses! Rising out of the grass, tangled round the sun-dial,
wreathing the tree trunks and hanging from their branches, climbing up the
walls and spreading over them with long garlands falling in cascades—they
came alive day by day, hour by hour. Fair fresh leaves, and buds—and
buds—tiny at first but swelling and working Magic until they burst and
uncurled into cups of scent delicately spilling themselves over their brims and
filling the garden air.

Colin saw it all, watching each change as it took place. Every morning he was
brought out and every hour of each day when it didn’t rain he spent in
the garden. Even gray days pleased him. He would lie on the grass
“watching things growing,” he said. If you watched long enough, he
declared, you could see buds unsheath themselves. Also you could make the
acquaintance of strange busy insect things running about on various unknown but
evidently serious errands, sometimes carrying tiny scraps of straw or feather
or food, or climbing blades of grass as if they were trees from whose tops one
could look out to explore the country. A mole throwing up its mound at the end
of its burrow and making its way out at last with the long-nailed paws which
looked so like elfish hands, had absorbed him one whole morning. Ants’
ways, beetles’ ways, bees’ ways, frogs’ ways, birds’
ways, plants’ ways, gave him a new world to explore and when Dickon
revealed them all and added foxes’ ways, otters’ ways,
ferrets’ ways, squirrels’ ways, and trout’ and
water-rats’ and badgers’ ways, there was no end to the things to
talk about and think over.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">科林目睹了一切，看着每一个变化发生。每天早晨他都被带出来，每天不下雨的时候他就在花园里度过每一个小时。即使是灰暗的日子也能让他高兴。他说，他会躺在草地上“看着东西生长”。他宣称，如果你观察的时间足够长的话，你可以看到花蕾自己出鞘。此外，你还可以认识一些奇怪的忙碌的昆虫，它们在各种未知但显然是严肃的任务中四处奔波，有时带着一些小草屑、羽毛或食物，或者爬上草叶，就好像它们是树，从树顶可以看到外面的世界。一天早上，一只鼹鼠在它的洞穴的尽头吐出它的土堆，最后用长钉子似的爪子朝外走去，那爪子看起来像精灵的手，把它吸引住了。蚂蚁的方式，甲虫的方式，蜜蜂的方式，青蛙的方式，鸟的方式，植物的方式，给了他一个新的世界去探索，当迪肯揭示了这一切，并增加了狐狸的方式，水獭的方式，雪貂的方式，松鼠的方式，鳟鱼，水鼠和獾的方式，没有尽头的事情来谈论和思考。</p>

And this was not the half of the Magic. The fact that he had really once stood

It was the first time Mary had heard of them, either, but even at this stage
she had begun to realize that, queer as he was, Colin had read about a great
many singular things and was somehow a very convincing sort of boy. When he
held up his head and fixed his strange eyes on you it seemed as if you believed
him almost in spite of yourself though he was only ten years old—going on

the fascination of actually making a sort of speech like a grown-up person.

“The great scientific discoveries I am going to make,” he went on,
“will be about Magic. Magic is a great thing and scarcely anyone knows
anything about it except a few people in old books—and Mary a little,
because she was born in India where there are fakirs. I believe Dickon knows
some Magic, but perhaps he doesn’t know he knows it. He charms animals
and people. I would never have let him come to see me if he had not been an
animal charmer—which is a boy charmer, too, because a boy is an animal. I
am sure there is Magic in everything, only we have not sense enough to get hold
of it and make it do things for us—like electricity and horses and
steam.”

“When Mary found this garden it looked quite dead,” the orator
proceeded. “Then something began pushing things up out of the soil and
making things out of nothing. One day things weren’t there and another
they were. I had never watched things before and it made me feel very curious.
Scientific people are always curious and I am going to be scientific. I keep
saying to myself, ‘What is it? What is it?’ It’s something.
It can’t be nothing! I don’t know its name so I call it Magic. I
have never seen the sun rise but Mary and Dickon have and from what they tell
me I am sure that is Magic too. Something pushes it up and draws it. Sometimes
since I’ve been in the garden I’ve looked up through the trees at
the sky and I have had a strange feeling of being happy as if something were
pushing and drawing in my chest and making me breathe fast. Magic is always
pushing and drawing and making things out of nothing. Everything is made out of
Magic, leaves and trees, flowers and birds, badgers and foxes and squirrels and
people. So it must be all around us. In this garden—in all the places.
The Magic in this garden has made me stand up and know I am going to live to be
a man. I am going to make the scientific experiment of trying to get some and
put it in myself and make it push and draw me and make me strong. I don’t
know how to do it but I think that if you keep thinking about it and calling it
perhaps it will come. Perhaps that is the first baby way to get it. When I was
going to try to stand that first time Mary kept saying to herself as fast as
she could, ‘You can do it! You can do it!’ and I did. I had to try
myself at the same time, of course, but her Magic helped me—and so did
Dickon’s. Every morning and evening and as often in the daytime as I can
remember I am going to say, ‘Magic is in me! Magic is making me well! I
am going to be as strong as Dickon, as strong as Dickon!’ And you must
all do it, too. That is my experiment Will you help, Ben Weatherstaff?”

gratified at being called upon to assist. Mistress Mary felt solemnly
enraptured. Dickon held his rabbit in his arm, and perhaps he made some
charmer’s signal no one heard, for when he sat down, cross-legged like

soothed into a sort of dream which was quite agreeable. The humming of the bees
in the blossoms mingled with the chanting voice and drowsily melted into a
doze. Dickon sat cross-legged with his rabbit asleep on his arm and a hand
resting on the lamb’s back. Soot had pushed away a squirrel and huddled
close to him on his shoulder, the gray film dropped over his eyes. At last
Colin stopped.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">他说了很多次，不是一千次，而是很多次。玛丽听得入了迷。她觉得这样既奇怪又美丽，她希望他继续说下去。本 · 韦瑟斯塔夫开始感到一种安慰，仿佛进入了一种非常惬意的梦境。花丛中蜜蜂的嗡嗡声和吟唱的声音交织在一起，昏昏欲睡地融化成一种打盹的声音。迪肯盘腿坐着，手臂上抱着睡着的兔子，一只手放在羊羔的背上。煤烟推开一只松鼠，蜷缩在他的肩膀上，灰色的薄膜落在他的眼睛上。最后科林停了下来。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“Now I am going to walk round the garden,” he announced.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“现在我要在花园里散步,”他宣布。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
Ben Weatherstaff’s head had just dropped forward and he lifted it with a
jerk.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">本 · 韦瑟斯塔夫的头刚刚向前倾，他猛地抬了起来。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“You have been asleep,” said Colin.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“你一直在睡觉,”科林说。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“Nowt o’ th’ sort,” mumbled Ben. “Th’
sermon was good enow—but I’m bound to get out afore th’
collection.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“不是那种,”本喃喃地说，“那次布道现在已经很好了ーー但是我一定要在收藏之前离开。”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
He was not quite awake yet.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">他还没有完全清醒。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“You’re not in church,” said Colin.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“你不是在教堂里,”科林说。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“Not me,” said Ben, straightening himself. “Who said I were?
I heard every bit of it. You said th’ Magic was in my back. Th’
doctor calls it rheumatics.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“不是我,”本说，站直了身子。“谁说我是了？我全都听到了。你说魔法在我背上。医生称之为风湿病</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
The Rajah waved his hand.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">国王挥了挥手。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“That was the wrong Magic,” he said. “You will get better.
You have my permission to go to your work. But come back tomorrow.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“那是错误的魔术师,”他说。你会好起来的。我允许你去工作了。明天再来吧”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“I’d like to see thee walk round the garden,” grunted Ben.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“我想看你在花园里走走,”本咕哝着说。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
It was not an unfriendly grunt, but it was a grunt. In fact, being a stubborn
old party and not having entire faith in Magic he had made up his mind that if
he were sent away he would climb his ladder and look over the wall so that he
might be ready to hobble back if there were any stumbling.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">这不是一声不友好的咕哝，而是一声咕哝。事实上，作为一个固执的老家伙，他并不完全相信魔法，他已经下定决心，如果自己被送走了，他会爬上梯子，翻过墙壁，这样一来，如果有什么绊脚石的话，他就可以一瘸一拐的回来了。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
The Rajah did not object to his staying and so the procession was formed. It
really did look like a procession. Colin was at its head with Dickon on one
side and Mary on the other. Ben Weatherstaff walked behind, and the
“creatures” trailed after them, the lamb and the fox cub keeping
close to Dickon, the white rabbit hopping along or stopping to nibble and Soot
following with the solemnity of a person who felt himself in charge.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">国王不反对他留下来，于是队伍就组成了。看起来确实像一个游行队伍。科林在它的头上，迪肯在一边，玛丽在另一边。本 · 韦瑟斯塔夫走在后面，那些“生物”跟在他们后面，小羊和小狐狸紧紧跟着迪肯，小白兔蹦蹦跳跳或者停下来啃咬，而苏特则严肃地跟在后面，仿佛觉得自己在掌控一切。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
It was a procession which moved slowly but with dignity. Every few yards it
stopped to rest. Colin leaned on Dickon’s arm and privately Ben
Weatherstaff kept a sharp lookout, but now and then Colin took his hand from
its support and walked a few steps alone. His head was held up all the time and
he looked very grand.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">这是一支缓慢而庄严的队伍。每隔几码它就停下来休息。科林靠在迪肯的胳膊上，本 · 韦瑟斯塔夫私下里保持着敏锐的警惕，但是不时地，科林从迪肯的支撑下抽出手，独自走了几步。他的头一直昂着，看起来非常壮观。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“The Magic is in me!” he kept saying. “The Magic is making me
strong! I can feel it! I can feel it!”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“魔法在我体内!”他一直说。“魔术让我变得强大！我能感觉到！我能感觉到!”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
It seemed very certain that something was upholding and uplifting him. He sat
on the seats in the alcoves, and once or twice he sat down on the grass and
several times he paused in the path and leaned on Dickon, but he would not give
up until he had gone all round the garden. When he returned to the canopy tree
his cheeks were flushed and he looked triumphant.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">似乎有什么东西在支持和鼓舞着他。他坐在凉亭里的座位上，有一两次他坐在草地上，有几次他在小路上停下来，靠在迪肯身上，但他不会放弃，直到他绕着花园走了一圈。当他回到树冠树，他的脸颊通红，他看起来胜利。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“I did it! The Magic worked!” he cried. “That is my first
scientific discovery.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“我成功了! 魔法起作用了!”他喊道，“这是我的第一个科学发现。”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“What will Dr. Craven say?” broke out Mary.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“克雷文医生会怎么说?”玛丽突然说。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“He won’t say anything,” Colin answered, “because he
will not be told. This is to be the biggest secret of all. No one is to know
anything about it until I have grown so strong that I can walk and run like any
other boy. I shall come here every day in my chair and I shall be taken back in
it. I won’t have people whispering and asking questions and I won’t
let my father hear about it until the experiment has quite succeeded. Then
sometime when he comes back to Misselthwaite I shall just walk into his study
and say ‘Here I am; I am like any other boy. I am quite well and I shall
live to be a man. It has been done by a scientific experiment.’”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“他什么也不会说,”科林回答，“因为他不会被告知。这是最大的秘密。除非我变得足够强壮，能像其他男孩一样走路和跑步，否则谁也不能知道这件事。我会每天坐在我的椅子上来这里，然后再坐回去。我不会让人们窃窃私语，问问题我也不会让我父亲听到这些直到实验完全成功。然后，当他回到 Misselthwaite 的时候，我会走进他的书房，对他说: “我在这里，我和其他男孩一样。我很好，我会活到成为一个男人。这是通过科学实验完成的。”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“He will think he is in a dream,” cried Mary. “He won’t
believe his eyes.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“他会以为自己在做梦,”玛丽喊道，“他不会相信自己的眼睛。”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
Colin flushed triumphantly. He had made himself believe that he was going to
get well, which was really more than half the battle, if he had been aware of
it. And the thought which stimulated him more than any other was this imagining
what his father would look like when he saw that he had a son who was as
straight and strong as other fathers’ sons. One of his darkest miseries
in the unhealthy morbid past days had been his hatred of being a sickly
weak-backed boy whose father was afraid to look at him.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">科林得意洋洋地脸红了。他让自己相信他会好起来，如果他意识到这一点的话，那真的是胜利的一半。最激发他的想法是想象他的父亲看到他有一个和其他父亲的儿子一样正直和强壮的儿子时会是什么样子。在过去那些病态的日子里，他最痛苦的事情之一就是痛恨自己是一个病弱的男孩，他的父亲不敢看他。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“He’ll be obliged to believe them,” he said.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“他不得不相信他们,”他说。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“One of the things I am going to do, after the Magic works and before I
begin to make scientific discoveries, is to be an athlete.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“在魔术开始之后，在我开始进行科学发现之前，我要做的事情之一就是成为一名运动员。”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“We shall have thee takin’ to boxin’ in a week or so,”
said Ben Weatherstaff. “Tha’lt end wi’ winnin’
th’ Belt an’ bein’ champion prize-fighter of all
England.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“再过一个星期左右，我们就要让你去打拳击了,”本 · 威瑟斯塔夫说。“最后赢得腰带，成为全英格兰的冠军拳击手”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
Colin fixed his eyes on him sternly.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">科林严厉地盯着他。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“Weatherstaff,” he said, “that is disrespectful. You must not
take liberties because you are in the secret. However much the Magic works I
shall not be a prize-fighter. I shall be a Scientific Discoverer.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“天气预报员,”他说，“这是不尊重。你不能随便乱来，因为你在秘密之中。无论魔术如何发挥作用，我都不会成为职业拳击手。我将成为一名科学发现者”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“Ax pardon—ax pardon, sir” answered Ben, touching his
forehead in salute. “I ought to have seed it wasn’t a jokin’
matter,” but his eyes twinkled and secretly he was immensely pleased. He
really did not mind being snubbed since the snubbing meant that the lad was
gaining strength and spirit.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“对不起，对不起，先生,”本回答说，一边抚摸着前额行礼。“我应该有种的，这不是开玩笑的事情,”但是他的眼睛闪烁着，暗地里他非常高兴。他真的不介意被冷落，因为冷落意味着这个小伙子正在获得力量和精神。</p>

“LET THEM LAUGH”<font class="cyxy-trs-target"> “让他们笑吧”</font></h2>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
The secret garden was not the only one Dickon worked in. Round the cottage on
the moor there was a piece of ground enclosed by a low wall of rough stones.
Early in the morning and late in the fading twilight and on all the days Colin
and Mary did not see him, Dickon worked there planting or tending potatoes and
cabbages, turnips and carrots and herbs for his mother. In the company of his
“creatures” he did wonders there and was never tired of doing them,
it seemed. While he dug or weeded he whistled or sang bits of Yorkshire moor
songs or talked to Soot or Captain or the brothers and sisters he had taught to
help him.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">迪肯工作的地方不仅仅是秘密花园。沼地上的小屋四周有一块地，被一堵粗石砌成的矮墙围住了。在科林和玛丽没有看到他的日子里，迪肯一大早就在那里工作，为他的母亲种植或照料土豆和卷心菜、萝卜、胡萝卜和香草。在他的“动物”的陪伴下，他在那里创造奇迹，而且似乎从不厌倦创造奇迹。当他挖土或除草时，他吹口哨或唱一些约克郡的荒野歌曲，或与苏特、上尉或他教过的帮助他的兄弟姐妹们交谈。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“We’d never get on as comfortable as we do,” Mrs. Sowerby
said, “if it wasn’t for Dickon’s garden. Anything’ll
grow for him. His ’taters and cabbages is twice th’ size of anyone
else’s an’ they’ve got a flavor with ’em as
nobody’s has.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“要不是迪肯的花园，我们永远不会过得这么舒服,”索尔比太太说。任何东西都会为他生长。他的洋芋和卷心菜是其他人的两倍大，而且它们的味道比任何人的都好。”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
When she found a moment to spare she liked to go out and talk to him. After
supper there was still a long clear twilight to work in and that was her quiet
time. She could sit upon the low rough wall and look on and hear stories of the
day. She loved this time. There were not only vegetables in this garden. Dickon
had bought penny packages of flower seeds now and then and sown bright
sweet-scented things among gooseberry bushes and even cabbages and he grew
borders of mignonette and pinks and pansies and things whose seeds he could
save year after year or whose roots would bloom each spring and spread in time
into fine clumps. The low wall was one of the prettiest things in Yorkshire
because he had tucked moorland foxglove and ferns and rock-cress and hedgerow
flowers into every crevice until only here and there glimpses of the stones
were to be seen.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">当她找到空闲的时间时，她喜欢出去和他说话。晚饭后，她还有一段漫长而清晰的黄昏要工作，那是她安静的时间。她可以坐在低矮粗糙的墙上，看着，听着当天的故事。她喜欢这次。这个花园里不仅有蔬菜。迪肯时不时地买一便士包的花籽，在醋栗丛甚至卷心菜中播种带有明亮香味的东西，他种植木犀草、粉红色、三色紫罗兰和那些他可以年复一年保存下来的种子，或者那些每年春天都会开花并及时蔓延成一簇簇的东西。矮墙是约克郡最漂亮的东西之一，因为他把荒原地带的毛地黄、蕨类植物、水芹和灌木丛中的花插入每一个缝隙，直到只能在这里或那里瞥见石头。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“All a chap’s got to do to make ’em thrive, mother,” he
would say, “is to be friends with ’em for sure. They’re just
like th’ ‘creatures.’ If they’re thirsty give ’em
drink and if they’re hungry give ’em a bit o’ food. They want
to live same as we do. If they died I should feel as if I’d been a bad
lad and somehow treated them heartless.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“一个小伙子要使他们茁壮成长，母亲,”他会说，“就是一定要和他们成为朋友。”。他们就像那些生物一样如果他们渴了，给他们喝水，如果他们饿了，给他们一点食物。他们想和我们一样生活。如果他们死了，我会觉得自己是个坏小子，不知怎么地对他们无情。”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
It was in these twilight hours that Mrs. Sowerby heard of all that happened at
Misselthwaite Manor. At first she was only told that “Mester Colin”
had taken a fancy to going out into the grounds with Miss Mary and that it was
doing him good. But it was not long before it was agreed between the two
children that Dickon’s mother might “come into the secret.”
Somehow it was not doubted that she was “safe for sure.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">正是在这个黄昏时分，索尔比太太听说了在 Misselthwaite Manor 发生的一切。一开始，她只听说“科林先生”喜欢和玛丽小姐一起出去玩，这对他有好处。但没过多久，两个孩子就达成了一致，狄肯的母亲可能会“知道这个秘密”不知何故，毫无疑问，她“肯定是安全的”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
So one beautiful still evening Dickon told the whole story, with all the
thrilling details of the buried key and the robin and the gray haze which had
seemed like deadness and the secret Mistress Mary had planned never to reveal.
The coming of Dickon and how it had been told to him, the doubt of Mester Colin
and the final drama of his introduction to the hidden domain, combined with the
incident of Ben Weatherstaff’s angry face peering over the wall and
Mester Colin’s sudden indignant strength, made Mrs. Sowerby’s
nice-looking face quite change color several times.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">于是，在一个美丽而宁静的夜晚，狄肯讲述了整个故事，讲述了所有关于被埋藏的钥匙、知更鸟、似乎已经死亡的灰色薄雾以及玛丽女主人计划永远不要透露的秘密的令人兴奋的细节。迪肯的到来以及他被告知的事情，科林先生的怀疑以及他对隐藏领域介绍的最后一幕戏剧，再加上本 · 威瑟斯塔夫愤怒的脸朝墙外张望的事件，以及科林先生突如其来的愤怒力量，使得索尔比夫人那张好看的脸色变了好几次。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“My word!” she said. “It was a good thing that little lass
came to th’ Manor. It’s been th’ makin’ o’ her
an’ th’ savin, o’ him. Standin’ on his feet! An’
us all thinkin’ he was a poor half-witted lad with not a straight bone in
him.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“我的话!”她说。“那个小姑娘来到庄园是件好事。一直以来都是他让她和他的救命恩人。站在他的脚上！我们都认为他是个没有骨气的可怜的傻小子。”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
She asked a great many questions and her blue eyes were full of deep thinking.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">她问了很多问题，蓝色的眼睛里充满了深思。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“What do they make of it at th’ Manor—him being so well
an’ cheerful an’ never complainin’?” she inquired.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“他们在庄园里是怎么看待这件事的? 他看起来那么健康，那么开朗，那么从不抱怨。”她问道。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“They don’t know what to make of it,” answered Dickon.
“Every day as comes round his face looks different. It’s
fillin’ out and doesn’t look so sharp an’ th’ waxy
color is goin’. But he has to do his bit o’
complainin’,” with a highly entertained grin.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“他们不知道这是怎么回事,”迪肯回答说。“每天他的脸看起来都不一样。它在变大，看起来不那么锋利了，颜色也变得蜡黄了。但是他不得不做他的一点’抱怨’,”带着一个高度娱乐的笑容。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“What for, i’ Mercy’s name?” asked Mrs. Sowerby.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“为什么，我叫梅西?”索尔比太太问。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
Dickon chuckled.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">迪肯咯咯地笑了。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“He does it to keep them from guessin’ what’s happened. If
the doctor knew he’d found out he could stand on his feet he’d
likely write and tell Mester Craven. Mester Colin’s savin’
th’ secret to tell himself. He’s goin’ to practise his Magic
on his legs every day till his father comes back an’ then he’s
goin’ to march into his room an’ show him he’s as straight as
other lads. But him an’ Miss Mary thinks it’s best plan to do a bit
o’ groanin’ an’ frettin’ now an’ then to throw
folk off th’ scent.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">他这么做是为了让他们猜不到发生了什么。如果医生知道他发现自己可以站起来，他很可能会写信告诉克雷文先生。科林先生把这个秘密留给了自己。他要每天用他的腿练习魔法直到他父亲回来然后他要大步走进他的房间让他看到他和其他小伙子一样正直。但是他和玛丽小姐认为最好的办法是现在发发牢骚，然后转移人们的注意力。”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
Mrs. Sowerby was laughing a low comfortable laugh long before he had finished
his last sentence.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">他还没说完最后一句话，索尔比太太就发出一声低沉而舒服的笑声。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“Eh!” she said, “that pair’s enjoyin’
theirselves I’ll warrant. They’ll get a good bit o’
actin’ out of it an’ there’s nothin’ children likes as
much as play actin’. Let’s hear what they do, Dickon lad.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“呃!”她说“我敢保证，那一对玩得很开心”。他们会从中获得很多表演的乐趣，孩子们最喜欢的就是表演了。让我们听听他们是怎么做的，迪肯小子</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
Dickon stopped weeding and sat up on his heels to tell her. His eyes were
twinkling with fun.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">迪肯停止除草，坐起来告诉她。他的眼睛里闪烁着快乐的光芒。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“Mester Colin is carried down to his chair every time he goes out,”
he explained. “An’ he flies out at John, th’ footman, for not
carryin’ him careful enough. He makes himself as helpless lookin’
as he can an’ never lifts his head until we’re out o’ sight
o’ th’ house. An’ he grunts an’ frets a good bit when
he’s bein’ settled into his chair. Him an’ Miss Mary’s
both got to enjoyin’ it an’ when he groans an’ complains
she’ll say, ‘Poor Colin! Does it hurt you so much? Are you so weak
as that, poor Colin?’—but th’ trouble is that sometimes they
can scarce keep from burstin’ out laughin’. When we get safe into
the garden they laugh till they’ve no breath left to laugh with.
An’ they have to stuff their faces into Mester Colin’s cushions to
keep the gardeners from hearin’, if any of, ’em’s
about.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“科林先生每次出门都会被抬到椅子上,”他解释说。“男仆约翰因为没有小心地把他抬起来，他就飞走了。他尽量让自己看起来无助，直到我们看不到房子，他才抬起头来。当他坐在椅子上的时候，他会发出咕噜声，有点烦躁。他和玛丽小姐都乐在其中，当他呻吟和抱怨时，玛丽小姐会说: “可怜的科林!”！你很受伤吗？你就这么软弱吗，可怜的科林？但问题是有时他们会忍不住大笑起来。当我们安全地进入花园，他们笑到没有气息留下来笑。他们不得不把脸塞进科林先生的坐垫里以防园丁听到他们的动静</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“Th’ more they laugh th’ better for ’em!” said
Mrs. Sowerby, still laughing herself. “Good healthy child laughin’s
better than pills any day o’ th’ year. That pair’ll plump up
for sure.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“他们笑得越多越好!”索尔比太太说，自己还在笑。“孩子们健康的笑声比药片好多了。那一对肯定会胖起来的。”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“They are plumpin’ up,” said Dickon. “They’re
that hungry they don’t know how to get enough to eat without makin’
talk. Mester Colin says if he keeps sendin’ for more food they
won’t believe he’s an invalid at all. Miss Mary says she’ll
let him eat her share, but he says that if she goes hungry she’ll get
thin an’ they mun both get fat at once.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">迪肯说: “他们的肚子都鼓起来了。”。“他们太饿了，不说话都不知道怎么弄到足够的食物。科林先生说如果他继续送食物过来他们就不会相信他是个残废了。玛丽小姐说她会让他吃她那份，但他说如果她饿了，她就会变瘦，他们就会同时变胖</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
Mrs. Sowerby laughed so heartily at the revelation of this difficulty that she
quite rocked backward and forward in her blue cloak, and Dickon laughed with
her.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">索尔比太太一听到这个难题就哈哈大笑起来，穿着蓝色斗篷，前后摇晃着，狄肯也跟着笑了起来。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“I’ll tell thee what, lad,” Mrs. Sowerby said when she could
speak. “I’ve thought of a way to help ’em. When tha’
goes to ’em in th’ mornin’s tha’ shall take a pail
o’ good new milk an’ I’ll bake ’em a crusty cottage
loaf or some buns wi’ currants in ’em, same as you children like.
Nothin’s so good as fresh milk an’ bread. Then they could take off
th’ edge o’ their hunger while they were in their garden an’
th, fine food they get indoors ’ud polish off th’ corners.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“我告诉你，小伙子,”索尔比太太说。我想到了一个办法来帮助他们。你们今天早上去的时候，要拿一桶新鲜的牛奶，我要给他们烤一条脆皮小屋面包或者一些加了醋栗的面包，就像你们这些孩子喜欢的那样。没有什么比鲜牛奶和面包更好的了。这样他们就可以在自己的花园里消除饥饿感，在室内获得美味的食物，并把墙角擦亮。”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“Eh! mother!” said Dickon admiringly, “what a wonder
tha’ art! Tha’ always sees a way out o’ things. They was
quite in a pother yesterday. They didn’t see how they was to manage
without orderin’ up more food—they felt that empty inside.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“呃！妈妈!”狄肯羡慕地说: “你的艺术真是奇迹！你总能找到出路。他们昨天忙得不可开交。他们不知道如何在不点更多食物的情况下管理自己的生活ーー他们感到内心空虚。”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“They’re two young ’uns growin’ fast, an’
health’s comin’ back to both of ’em. Children like that feels
like young wolves an’ food’s flesh an’ blood to

smile. “Eh! but they’re enjoyin’ theirselves for sure,”
she said.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“他们是两个快速成长的年轻人，他们的健康正在恢复。索尔比太太说: “这样的孩子感觉就像小狼，对他们来说，食物就是肉，就是血。”。然后她笑了，迪肯也笑了。“呃！但他们肯定玩得很开心,”她说。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
She was quite right, the comfortable wonderful mother creature—and she
had never been more so than when she said their “play actin’”

of entertainment. The idea of protecting themselves from suspicion had been
unconsciously suggested to them first by the puzzled nurse and then by Dr.
Craven himself.

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“Your appetite. Is improving very much, Master Colin,” the nurse
had said one day. “You used to eat nothing, and so many things disagreed
with you.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">你的胃口。正在好转，科林少爷,”有一天护士说。“你以前什么都不吃，很多东西都不适合你。”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“Nothing disagrees with me now” replied Colin, and then seeing the
nurse looking at him curiously he suddenly remembered that perhaps he ought not
to appear too well just yet. “At least things don’t so often
disagree with me. It’s the fresh air.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“现在没有什么不适合我了,”科林回答，然后看到护士好奇地看着他，他突然想起来，也许他现在还不应该表现得太好。“至少事情并不总是与我意见相左。是新鲜空气。”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“Perhaps it is,” said the nurse, still looking at him with a
mystified expression. “But I must talk to Dr. Craven about it.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“也许是吧,”护士说，仍然带着疑惑的表情看着他。“但我必须和克雷文医生谈谈”</p>

“How she stared at you!” said Mary when she went away. “As if
she thought there must be something to find out.”

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“I won’t have her finding out things,” said Colin. “No
one must begin to find out yet.”

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
When Dr. Craven came that morning he seemed puzzled, also. He asked a number of
questions, to Colin’s great annoyance.

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“You stay out in the garden a great deal,” he suggested.
“Where do you go?”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“你经常呆在花园里,”他建议道，“你去哪儿?”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
Colin put on his favorite air of dignified indifference to opinion.

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“I will not let anyone know where I go,” he answered. “I go
to a place I like. Everyone has orders to keep out of the way. I won’t
be watched and stared at. You know that!”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“我不会让任何人知道我去了哪里,”他回答。“我去一个我喜欢的地方。每个人都接到命令，不要挡道。我不想被人盯着看。你知道的!”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“You seem to be out all day but I do not think it has done you

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“Perhaps,” said Colin, prompted by a sudden inspiration,
“perhaps it is an unnatural appetite.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“也许,”科林突然灵机一动，说道，“也许这是一种反常的胃口。”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“I do not think so, as your food seems to agree with you,” said Dr.
Craven. “You are gaining flesh rapidly and your color is better.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">克雷文博士说: “我不这么认为，因为你的食物似乎很适合你。”。“你的肉长得很快，你的肤色也更好了。”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“Perhaps—perhaps I am bloated and feverish,” said Colin,
assuming a discouraging air of gloom. “People who are not going to live
are often—different.”

Dr. Craven shook his head. He was holding Colin’s wrist and he pushed up
his sleeve and felt his arm.

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“You are not feverish,” he said thoughtfully, “and such flesh
as you have gained is healthy. If you can keep this up, my boy, we need not
talk of dying. Your father will be happy to hear of this remarkable
improvement.”

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“I won’t have him told!” Colin broke forth fiercely.
“It will only disappoint him if I get worse again—and I may get
worse this very night. I might have a raging fever. I feel as if I might be
beginning to have one now. I won’t have letters written to my
father—I won’t—I won’t! You are making me angry and you
know that is bad for me. I feel hot already. I hate being written about and
being talked over as much as I hate being stared at!”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“我不会让他知道的!”科林激烈地发表了意见。“如果我的情况再次恶化，只会让他失望ーー而且今晚我可能会变得更糟。我可能会发高烧。我觉得我现在可能开始有了。我不会让人给我父亲写信ーー我不会ーー我不会！你让我很生气，你知道这对我不好。我已经觉得热了。我讨厌被人写，讨厌被人议论，就像我讨厌被人盯着看一样!”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“Hush-h! my boy,” Dr. Craven soothed him. “Nothing shall be
written without your permission. You are too sensitive about things. You must
not undo the good which has been done.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“嘘！我的孩子,”克雷文医生安慰他说。没有你的允许，什么都不能写。你对事情太敏感了。你不能毁掉已经做过的好事”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
He said no more about writing to Mr. Craven and when he saw the nurse he
privately warned her that such a possibility must not be mentioned to the
patient.

“The boy is extraordinarily better,” he said. “His advance
seems almost abnormal. But of course he is doing now of his own free will what
we could not make him do before. Still, he excites himself very easily and
nothing must be said to irritate him.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“这个男孩好得不得了,”他说。“他的进展似乎不太正常。但是，当然，他现在是在自愿地做我们以前不能让他做的事情。尽管如此，他还是很容易兴奋，不能说任何话来激怒他。”</p>

Mary and Colin were much alarmed and talked together anxiously. From this time
dated their plan of “play actin’.”

“I may be obliged to have a tantrum,” said Colin regretfully.
“I don’t want to have one and I’m not miserable enough now to
work myself into a big one. Perhaps I couldn’t have one at all. That lump

of horrible ones. But if they talk about writing to my father I shall have to
do something.”

He made up his mind to eat less, but unfortunately it was not possible to carry
out this brilliant idea when he wakened each morning with an amazing appetite
and the table near his sofa was set with a breakfast of home-made bread and
fresh butter, snow-white eggs, raspberry jam and clotted cream. Mary always
breakfasted with him and when they found themselves at the
table—particularly if there were delicate slices of sizzling ham sending
forth tempting odors from under a hot silver cover—they would look into
each other’s eyes in desperation.

“It’s enough for a person who is going to die,” answered Mary
when first she heard this, “but it’s not enough for a person who is

</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“对于一个即将死去的人来说，这已经足够了,”玛丽第一次听到这句话时回答道，“但对于一个即将活下去的人来说，这还不够。”。有时候，当沼泽地上那些新鲜的石南花和金雀花的香味从敞开的窗户涌进来时，我觉得自己好像可以吃下三个。”</p>

The morning that Dickon—after they had been enjoying themselves in the
garden for about two hours—went behind a big rosebush and brought forth
two tin pails and revealed that one was full of rich new milk with cream on the
top of it, and that the other held cottage-made currant buns folded in a clean
blue and white napkin, buns so carefully tucked in that they were still hot,
there was a riot of surprised joyfulness. What a wonderful thing for Mrs.

were! And what delicious fresh milk!
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">那天早上，迪肯——他们在花园里玩了大约两个小时之后——走到一棵大玫瑰花丛后面，拿出两个锡桶，发现其中一个装满了新鲜的牛奶，上面还有奶油，另一个拿着家庭制作的葡萄干面包，用干净的蓝白色餐巾包着，小心翼翼地塞进去，面包还是热的，那里充满了惊喜。对索尔比太太来说，这是多么美妙的事情啊！她一定是个多么善良、聪明的女人啊！包子真好吃！多么美味的鲜奶啊！</p>

“Magic is in her just as it is in Dickon,” said Colin. “It

And then forgetting his grandeur he fell to and stuffed himself with buns and

This was the beginning of many agreeable incidents of the same kind. They
actually awoke to the fact that as Mrs. Sowerby had fourteen people to provide

they asked her to let them send some of their shillings to buy things.

Dickon made the stimulating discovery that in the wood in the park outside the
garden where Mary had first found him piping to the wild creatures there was a
deep little hollow where you could build a sort of tiny oven with stones and
roast potatoes and eggs in it. Roasted eggs were a previously unknown luxury
and very hot potatoes with salt and fresh butter in them were fit for a
woodland king—besides being deliciously satisfying. You could buy both
potatoes and eggs and eat as many as you liked without feeling as if you were
taking food out of the mouths of fourteen people.

Every beautiful morning the Magic was worked by the mystic circle under the
plum-tree which provided a canopy of thickening green leaves after its brief
blossom-time was ended. After the ceremony Colin always took his walking
exercise and throughout the day he exercised his newly found power at
intervals. Each day he grew stronger and could walk more steadily and cover
more ground. And each day his belief in the Magic grew stronger—as well
it might. He tried one experiment after another as he felt himself gaining
strength and it was Dickon who showed him the best things of all.

“Yesterday,” he said one morning after an absence, “I went to
Thwaite for mother an’ near th’ Blue Cow Inn I seed Bob Haworth.
He’s the strongest chap on th’ moor. He’s the champion

th’ hammer farther. He’s gone all th’ way to Scotland for
th’ sports some years. He’s knowed me ever since I was a little
’un an’ he’s a friendly sort an’ I axed him some
questions. Th’ gentry calls him a athlete and I thought o’ thee,
Mester Colin, and I says, ‘How did tha’ make tha’ muscles
stick out that way, Bob? Did tha’ do anythin’ extra to make
thysel’ so strong?’ An’ he says ‘Well, yes, lad, I did.
A strong man in a show that came to Thwaite once showed me how to exercise my
arms an’ legs an’ every muscle in my body. An’ I says,
‘Could a delicate chap make himself stronger with ’em, Bob?’
an’ he laughed an’ says, ‘Art tha’ th’ delicate
chap?’ an’ I says, ‘No, but I knows a young gentleman
that’s gettin’ well of a long illness an’ I wish I knowed
some o’ them tricks to tell him about.’ I didn’t say no names
an’ he didn’t ask none. He’s friendly same as I said

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
Dickon stood up on the grass and slowly went through a carefully practical but
simple series of muscle exercises. Colin watched them with widening eyes. He
could do a few while he was sitting down. Presently he did a few gently while
he stood upon his already steadied feet. Mary began to do them also. Soot, who
was watching the performance, became much disturbed and left his branch and
hopped about restlessly because he could not do them too.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">迪肯站在草地上，慢慢地进行了一系列精心实践但简单的肌肉锻炼。科林睁大眼睛看着他们。他可以在坐着的时候做一些。不一会儿，他站稳了脚，轻轻地做了几个动作。玛丽也开始这样做。正在观看表演的苏特感到非常不安，他离开了树枝，不安地跳来跳去，因为他也跳不动。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
From that time the exercises were part of the day’s duties as much as the
Magic was. It became possible for both Colin and Mary to do more of them each
time they tried, and such appetites were the results that but for the basket
Dickon put down behind the bush each morning when he arrived they would have
been lost. But the little oven in the hollow and Mrs. Sowerby’s bounties
were so satisfying that Mrs. Medlock and the nurse and Dr. Craven became
mystified again. You can trifle with your breakfast and seem to disdain your
dinner if you are full to the brim with roasted eggs and potatoes and richly
frothed new milk and oatcakes and buns and heather honey and clotted cream.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">从那时起，这些练习就和魔术一样成为了一天的任务之一。科林和玛丽每次尝试的时候都可以做更多的这样的事情，这样的欲望就是结果，如果没有迪肯每天早上到达时放在灌木丛后面的那个篮子，他们就会迷路。但是洞里的小烤箱和索尔比太太的赏金是如此令人满意，以至于梅德洛克太太、护士和克雷文医生再次变得迷惑不解。你可以随意摆弄你的早餐，如果你吃的满满的都是烤鸡蛋、土豆、泡沫丰富的新鲜牛奶、燕麦饼、小圆面包、石南花蜂蜜和凝固奶油，你似乎会鄙视你的晚餐。</p>

Dr. Craven came and looked at Colin long and carefully, He wore an extremely
worried expression when the nurse talked with him and showed him the almost
untouched tray of breakfast she had saved for him to look at—but it was
even more worried when he sat down by Colin’s sofa and examined him. He
had been called to London on business and had not seen the boy for nearly two
weeks. When young things begin to gain health they gain it rapidly. The waxen
tinge had left, Colins skin and a warm rose showed through it; his beautiful
eyes were clear and the hollows under them and in his cheeks and temples had
filled out. His once dark, heavy locks had begun to look as if they sprang
healthily from his forehead and were soft and warm with life. His lips were
fuller and of a normal color. In fact as an imitation of a boy who was a
confirmed invalid he was a disgraceful sight. Dr. Craven held his chin in his
hand and thought him over.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">克雷文医生走过来，长时间仔细地看着科林，护士和他说话的时候，他的表情非常担心，把她留给他看的几乎没有动过的早餐托盘拿给他看ーー但是当他坐在科林的沙发边检查他的时候，他的表情更加担心。他被叫到伦敦出差，差不多有两个星期没有见到那个男孩了。当年轻人开始获得健康时，他们很快就会获得健康。蜡黄的颜色已经褪去，柯林斯的皮肤和一朵温暖的玫瑰从中显露出来; 他美丽的眼睛是清澈的，眼睛下面、脸颊和太阳穴里的空洞已经填满了。他那曾经黝黑沉重的头发开始看起来像是健康地从他的前额上垂下来，柔软而温暖。他的嘴唇更饱满，颜色也正常。事实上，作为一个被确认为残疾的男孩的模仿者，他是一个可耻的景象。克雷文医生用手托着下巴，仔细想了想。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“I am sorry to hear that you do not eat anything,” he said.

“But,” she said afterward to Colin, “I couldn’t stop
myself. It just burst out because all at once I couldn’t help remembering
that last big potato you ate and the way your mouth stretched when you bit
through that thick lovely crust with jam and clotted cream on it.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“但是,”她后来对科林说，“我控制不住自己。它突然爆发出来，因为我突然想起了你上次吃的那个大土豆，还有当你咬破厚厚的、上面有果酱和凝固奶油的可爱面包皮时，你张开嘴的样子。”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“Is there any way in which those children can get food secretly?”
Dr. Craven inquired of Mrs. Medlock.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“有没有什么办法可以让那些孩子偷偷地得到食物?”克雷文医生问梅德洛克太太。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“There’s no way unless they dig it out of the earth or pick it off
the trees,” Mrs. Medlock answered. “They stay out in the grounds
all day and see no one but each other. And if they want anything different to
eat from what’s sent up to them they need only ask for it.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“除非他们把它从地里挖出来，或者从树上摘下来，否则没有办法,”梅德洛克太太回答。“他们整天呆在外面，除了彼此谁也看不见。如果他们想要的东西与送上来的东西不同，他们只需要开口就可以了。”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“Well,” said Dr. Craven, “so long as going without food
agrees with them we need not disturb ourselves. The boy is a new
creature.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“好吧,”克雷文医生说，“只要不吃东西对它们有好处，我们就不必打扰自己。这孩子是个新生儿”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“So is the girl,” said Mrs. Medlock. “She’s begun to be
downright pretty since she’s filled out and lost her ugly little sour
look. Her hair’s grown thick and healthy looking and she’s got a
bright color. The glummest, ill-natured little thing she used to be and now her
and Master Colin laugh together like a pair of crazy young ones. Perhaps
they’re growing fat on that.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“那个女孩也是,”梅德洛克太太说。“她已经开始变得非常漂亮了，因为她已经变得丰满了，而且不再那么难看了。她的头发长得又厚又健康，而且颜色很鲜艳。她曾经是个阴郁、坏脾气的小东西，现在她和科林少爷像一对疯狂的年轻人一样在一起大笑。也许他们正因此变得越来越胖。”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“Perhaps they are,” said Dr. Craven. “Let them laugh.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“也许是吧,”克雷文医生说，“让他们笑吧。”</p>

THE CURTAIN<font class="cyxy-trs-target"> 窗帘</font></h2>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
And the secret garden bloomed and bloomed and every morning revealed new
miracles. In the robin’s nest there were Eggs and the robin’s mate
sat upon them keeping them warm with her feathery little breast and careful
wings. At first she was very nervous and the robin himself was indignantly
watchful. Even Dickon did not go near the close-grown corner in those days, but
waited until by the quiet working of some mysterious spell he seemed to have
conveyed to the soul of the little pair that in the garden there was nothing
which was not quite like themselves—nothing which did not understand the
wonderfulness of what was happening to them—the immense, tender,
terrible, heart-breaking beauty and solemnity of Eggs. If there had been one
person in that garden who had not known through all his or her innermost being
that if an Egg were taken away or hurt the whole world would whirl round and
crash through space and come to an end—if there had been even one who did
not feel it and act accordingly there could have been no happiness even in that
golden springtime air. But they all knew it and felt it and the robin and his
mate knew they knew it.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">秘密花园开了又开，每天早上都有新的奇迹出现。知更鸟的巢里有一些蛋，知更鸟的伴侣坐在蛋上，用她那羽毛般的小胸脯和小心翼翼的翅膀给它们保暖。起初，她非常紧张，知更鸟自己也愤怒地警惕着。在那些日子里，甚至连狄肯也没有走近过那个密闭的角落，而是静静地等待着，直到他用某种神秘的咒语向这对小夫妻的灵魂传达了这样的信息: 在花园里，没有什么东西不像他们自己ーー没有什么东西不理解发生在他们身上的事情的奇妙ーー鸡蛋那巨大的、温柔的、可怕的、令人心碎的美丽和庄严。如果那个花园里有一个人，他的内心深处并不知道，如果一个蛋被带走或者受到伤害，整个世界都会在空中旋转，撞碎，然后结束。如果有一个人没有感觉到，并且做出相应的行动，那么即使在那金色的春天的空气中，也不会有幸福。但是他们都知道，也感觉到了知更鸟和它的伙伴知道他们知道。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
At first the robin watched Mary and Colin with sharp anxiety. For some
mysterious reason he knew he need not watch Dickon. The first moment he set his
dew-bright black eye on Dickon he knew he was not a stranger but a sort of
robin without beak or feathers. He could speak robin (which is a quite distinct
language not to be mistaken for any other). To speak robin to a robin is like
speaking French to a Frenchman. Dickon always spoke it to the robin himself, so
the queer gibberish he used when he spoke to humans did not matter in the
least. The robin thought he spoke this gibberish to them because they were not
intelligent enough to understand feathered speech. His movements also were
robin. They never startled one by being sudden enough to seem dangerous or
threatening. Any robin could understand Dickon, so his presence was not even
disturbing.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">起初，知更鸟焦急地看着玛丽和科林。出于某种神秘的原因，他知道他不需要照看迪肯。他第一眼看到迪肯时，就知道他不是一个陌生人，而是一只没有喙和羽毛的知更鸟。他会说知更鸟语(这是一种非常独特的语言，不会被误认为是其他语言)。对知更鸟说知更鸟就像对法国人说法语。迪肯总是亲自对知更鸟说这些话，所以他对人类说话时的那些奇怪的胡言乱语一点也不重要。知更鸟认为他对它们说这些胡言乱语是因为它们没有足够的智力来理解羽毛语言。他的动作也像知更鸟。他们从来不会突然地让人感到危险或者有威胁。任何知更鸟都能听懂迪肯的话，所以他的存在并不令人不安。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
But at the outset it seemed necessary to be on guard against the other two. In
the first place the boy creature did not come into the garden on his legs. He
was pushed in on a thing with wheels and the skins of wild animals were thrown
over him. That in itself was doubtful. Then when he began to stand up and move
about he did it in a queer unaccustomed way and the others seemed to have to
help him. The robin used to secrete himself in a bush and watch this anxiously,
his head tilted first on one side and then on the other. He thought that the
slow movements might mean that he was preparing to pounce, as cats do. When
cats are preparing to pounce they creep over the ground very slowly. The robin
talked this over with his mate a great deal for a few days but after that he
decided not to speak of the subject because her terror was so great that he was
afraid it might be injurious to the Eggs.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">但一开始，似乎有必要提防另外两种情况。首先，这个男孩并不是用双腿走进花园的。他被推上一个带轮子的东西，野兽的皮扔在他身上。这本身就值得怀疑。然后，当他开始站起来走动的时候，他以一种奇怪的、不习惯的方式这样做了，其他人似乎不得不帮助他。知更鸟过去常常躲在灌木丛里，焦急地看着这一切，它的头先歪向一边，然后又歪向另一边。他认为这种缓慢的动作可能意味着他正准备像猫一样猛扑过去。当猫准备扑击时，它们在地上爬得很慢。知更鸟和它的伴侣就这个问题讨论了好几天，但是之后他决定不再谈论这个话题，因为她的恐惧是如此的强烈，以至于他害怕它会伤害到蛋。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
When the boy began to walk by himself and even to move more quickly it was an
immense relief. But for a long time—or it seemed a long time to the
robin—he was a source of some anxiety. He did not act as the other humans
did. He seemed very fond of walking but he had a way of sitting or lying down
for a while and then getting up in a disconcerting manner to begin again.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">当男孩开始自己走路，甚至走得更快，这是一个巨大的解脱。但在很长一段时间里——或者说在知更鸟看来是很长一段时间——它成了焦虑的来源。他的行为与其他人类不同。他似乎很喜欢走路，但他有一种方法，坐下或躺下一会儿，然后以一种令人不安的方式站起来重新开始。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
One day the robin remembered that when he himself had been made to learn to fly
by his parents he had done much the same sort of thing. He had taken short
flights of a few yards and then had been obliged to rest. So it occurred to him
that this boy was learning to fly—or rather to walk. He mentioned this to
his mate and when he told her that the Eggs would probably conduct themselves
in the same way after they were fledged she was quite comforted and even became
eagerly interested and derived great pleasure from watching the boy over the
edge of her nest—though she always thought that the Eggs would be much
cleverer and learn more quickly. But then she said indulgently that humans were
always more clumsy and slow than Eggs and most of them never seemed really to
learn to fly at all. You never met them in the air or on tree-tops.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">有一天，知更鸟想起当他自己被父母教导学习飞行时，他也做过同样的事情。他飞了几码远，然后不得不休息。于是他想到这个男孩正在学习飞行ーー或者更确切地说是学习走路。他把这件事告诉了他的配偶，当他告诉她蛋羽毛长大后可能会以同样的方式行动时，她感到非常安慰，甚至变得非常热切地感兴趣，从看着男孩在她的巢边缘获得了巨大的快乐ーー尽管她总是认为蛋会更聪明，学得更快。但是她又放纵地说，人类总是比蛋蛋更笨拙和迟钝，他们中的大多数似乎从来没有真正学会飞翔。你从没在空中或树顶上见过他们。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
After a while the boy began to move about as the others did, but all three of
the children at times did unusual things. They would stand under the trees and
move their arms and legs and heads about in a way which was neither walking nor
running nor sitting down. They went through these movements at intervals every
day and the robin was never able to explain to his mate what they were doing or
tying to do. He could only say that he was sure that the Eggs would never flap
about in such a manner; but as the boy who could speak robin so fluently was
doing the thing with them, birds could be quite sure that the actions were not
of a dangerous nature. Of course neither the robin nor his mate had ever heard
of the champion wrestler, Bob Haworth, and his exercises for making the muscles
stand out like lumps. Robins are not like human beings; their muscles are
always exercised from the first and so they develop themselves in a natural
manner. If you have to fly about to find every meal you eat, your muscles do
not become atrophied (atrophied means wasted away through want of use).
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">过了一会儿，男孩开始像其他孩子一样四处走动，但是三个孩子有时都会做一些不寻常的事情。他们会站在树下，以一种既不走路，也不跑步，也不坐着的方式来回移动他们的胳膊、腿和头。它们每天都有间歇性地做这些动作，知更鸟从来不能向它的配偶解释它们在做什么或打算做什么。他只能说，他确信鸟蛋不会以这种方式飞来飞去; 但是因为这个能说流利知更鸟语的男孩正在和它们做这件事，鸟儿可以确信这种行为不是危险的。当然，无论是知更鸟还是它的伴侣都没有听说过摔跤冠军鲍勃 · 霍沃斯，也没有听说过他为了使肌肉突出而做的练习。知更鸟不像人类，它们的肌肉总是从一开始就被锻炼，因此它们以一种自然的方式发展自己。如果你必须飞来飞去才能找到你吃的每一顿饭，你的肌肉就不会萎缩(萎缩意味着由于缺乏使用而消耗殆尽)。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
When the boy was walking and running about and digging and weeding like the
others, the nest in the corner was brooded over by a great peace and content.
Fears for the Eggs became things of the past. Knowing that your Eggs were as
safe as if they were locked in a bank vault and the fact that you could watch
so many curious things going on made setting a most entertaining occupation. On
wet days the Eggs’ mother sometimes felt even a little dull because the
children did not come into the garden.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">当男孩像其他孩子一样走路、跑来跑去、挖掘、除草时，角落里的鸟巢显得非常平静和满足。对蛋的恐惧成为过去。知道你的鸡蛋就像被锁在银行金库里一样安全，而且你可以看到这么多奇怪的事情发生，这使得设置一个最有趣的职业。在下雨的日子里，鸡蛋的妈妈有时甚至觉得有点迟钝，因为孩子们没有进入花园。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
But even on wet days it could not be said that Mary and Colin were dull. One
morning when the rain streamed down unceasingly and Colin was beginning to feel
a little restive, as he was obliged to remain on his sofa because it was not
safe to get up and walk about, Mary had an inspiration.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">但即使是在雨天，也不能说玛丽和科林很无趣。一天早上，雨不停地下着，科林开始感到有点不安，因为起床走动不安全，他不得不呆在沙发上，玛丽突然有了灵感。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“Now that I am a real boy,” Colin had said, “my legs and arms
and all my body are so full of Magic that I can’t keep them still. They
want to be doing things all the time. Do you know that when I waken in the
morning, Mary, when it’s quite early and the birds are just shouting
outside and everything seems just shouting for joy—even the trees and
things we can’t really hear—I feel as if I must jump out of bed and
shout myself. If I did it, just think what would happen!”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“现在我是一个真正的男孩了,”科林说，“我的腿、胳膊和全身都充满了魔力，我无法让它们安静下来。他们想一直做事。你知道吗，玛丽，当我早上醒来时，天还很早，鸟儿在外面叫喊，一切似乎都在欢呼ーー甚至是树木和我们听不到的东西ーー我觉得我必须从床上跳起来，大声呼喊自己。如果我这么做了，想想会发生什么吧!”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
Mary giggled inordinately.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">玛丽无节制地咯咯笑。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“The nurse would come running and Mrs. Medlock would come running and
they would be sure you had gone crazy and they’d send for the
doctor,” she said.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“护士会跑过来，梅德洛克太太也会跑过来，他们肯定你已经疯了，他们会派人去请医生,”她说。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
Colin giggled himself. He could see how they would all look—how horrified
by his outbreak and how amazed to see him standing upright.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">科林咯咯地笑。他可以看到他们看起来都是什么样子ーー对自己的疾病爆发有多么恐惧，看到自己直立起来有多么惊讶。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“I wish my father would come home,” he said. “I want to tell
him myself. I’m always thinking about it—but we couldn’t go
on like this much longer. I can’t stand lying still and pretending, and
besides I look too different. I wish it wasn’t raining today.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“我希望我父亲能回家,”他说。我想亲自告诉他。我一直在想这件事，但我们不能再这样下去了。我受不了一动不动地躺着假装，而且我看起来太不一样了。我希望今天不下雨。”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
It was then Mistress Mary had her inspiration.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">就在那时，玛丽小姐得到了她的灵感。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“Colin,” she began mysteriously, “do you know how many rooms
there are in this house?”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“科林,”她神秘地开口说，“你知道这房子里有多少个房间吗?”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“About a thousand, I suppose,” he answered.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“我想大约有一千人吧,”他回答说。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“There’s about a hundred no one ever goes into,” said Mary.
“And one rainy day I went and looked into ever so many of them. No one
ever knew, though Mrs. Medlock nearly found me out. I lost my way when I was
coming back and I stopped at the end of your corridor. That was the second time
I heard you crying.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“大约有一百个地方从来没有人进去过,”玛丽说。“有一天下雨，我去调查了他们中的许多人。没人知道，尽管梅德洛克夫人差点发现了我。我回来的时候迷路了，在你家走廊的尽头停了下来。这是我第二次听到你哭了”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
Colin started up on his sofa.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">科林开始在他的沙发上。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“A hundred rooms no one goes into,” he said. “It sounds
almost like a secret garden. Suppose we go and look at them. Wheel me in my
chair and nobody would know we went.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“一百个房间没人进去,”他说。“听起来就像一个秘密花园。我们去看看吧。把我推到椅子上，没人会知道我们去了。”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“That’s what I was thinking,” said Mary. “No one would
dare to follow us. There are galleries where you could run. We could do our
exercises. There is a little Indian room where there is a cabinet full of ivory
elephants. There are all sorts of rooms.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“我也是这么想的,”玛丽说。没人敢跟着我们。有些画廊你可以去。我们可以做练习。有一个印第安人的小房间，里面有一个装满象牙大象的橱柜。这里有各种各样的房间。”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“Ring the bell,” said Colin.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“按门铃,”科林说。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
When the nurse came in he gave his orders.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">当护士进来时，他发出了命令。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“I want my chair,” he said. “Miss Mary and I are going to
look at the part of the house which is not used. John can push me as far as the
picture-gallery because there are some stairs. Then he must go away and leave
us alone until I send for him again.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“我要我的椅子,”他说。“玛丽小姐和我要去看看房子里没有使用的部分。约翰可以把我推到画廊那边，因为那里有楼梯。那么他必须离开，离开我们，直到我再次派人去找他。”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
Rainy days lost their terrors that morning. When the footman had wheeled the
chair into the picture-gallery and left the two together in obedience to
orders, Colin and Mary looked at each other delighted. As soon as Mary had made
sure that John was really on his way back to his own quarters below stairs,
Colin got out of his chair.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">那天早晨，雨天失去了恐惧。当男仆把椅子推进画廊，让两个人按照命令坐在一起时，科林和玛丽高兴地互相看了看。玛丽一确定约翰真的要回楼下自己的住处，科林就从椅子上站了起来。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“I am going to run from one end of the gallery to the other,” he
said, “and then I am going to jump and then we will do Bob
Haworth’s exercises.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“我要从画廊的一头跑到另一头,”他说，“然后我要跳下去，然后我们做鲍勃 · 霍沃斯的练习。”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
And they did all these things and many others. They looked at the portraits and
found the plain little girl dressed in green brocade and holding the parrot on
her finger.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">他们做了所有这些事情，还有许多其他的事情。他们看着那些画像，发现那个穿着绿色锦缎的朴素小女孩手指上拿着一只鹦鹉。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“All these,” said Colin, “must be my relations. They lived a
long time ago. That parrot one, I believe, is one of my great, great, great,
great aunts. She looks rather like you, Mary—not as you look now but as
you looked when you came here. Now you are a great deal fatter and better
looking.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“所有这些,”科林说，“一定是我的亲戚。他们生活在很久以前。那只鹦鹉，我相信，是我的一位伟大的，伟大的，伟大的，伟大的阿姨。她长得很像你，玛丽ーー不是现在的样子，而是你来这里时的样子。现在你胖多了，长得也好看多了。”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“So are you,” said Mary, and they both laughed.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“你也是,”玛丽说，他们俩都笑了。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
They went to the Indian room and amused themselves with the ivory elephants.
They found the rose-colored brocade boudoir and the hole in the cushion the
mouse had left, but the mice had grown up and run away and the hole was empty.
They saw more rooms and made more discoveries than Mary had made on her first
pilgrimage. They found new corridors and corners and flights of steps and new
old pictures they liked and weird old things they did not know the use of. It
was a curiously entertaining morning and the feeling of wandering about in the
same house with other people but at the same time feeling as if one were miles
away from them was a fascinating thing.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">他们来到印第安人的房间，和象牙象一起消遣。他们发现了玫瑰色的锦绣闺房和老鼠留下的垫子上的洞，但是老鼠已经长大并且逃跑了，而且那个洞是空的。他们看到了比玛丽第一次朝圣时更多的房间和更多的发现。他们发现了新的走廊、角落、台阶和他们喜欢的新旧图片，还有他们不知道用途的古怪的旧东西。这是一个奇怪而有趣的早晨，和其他人在同一所房子里游荡的感觉，但同时感觉好像离他们有几英里远，这是一件令人着迷的事情。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“I’m glad we came,” Colin said. “I never knew I lived
in such a big queer old place. I like it. We will ramble about every rainy day.
We shall always be finding new queer corners and things.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“我很高兴我们来了,”科林说。“我从来不知道我住在一个这么大的古怪的老地方。我喜欢。我们将在每个雨天漫步。我们总会发现新的奇怪的角落和事物。”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
That morning they had found among other things such good appetites that when
they returned to Colin’s room it was not possible to send the luncheon
away untouched.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">那天早上，他们发现除了别的事情以外，他们的胃口非常好，所以当他们回到科林的房间时，不可能把午餐原封不动地送走。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
When the nurse carried the tray downstairs she slapped it down on the kitchen
dresser so that Mrs. Loomis, the cook, could see the highly polished dishes and
plates.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">当护士端着托盘下楼的时候，她把托盘重重地放在厨房的梳妆台上，这样厨师卢米斯太太就可以看到那些精心打磨过的盘子和盘子了。</p>

“Look at that!” she said. “This is a house of mystery, and
those two children are the greatest mysteries in it.”

“If they keep that up every day,” said the strong young footman
John, “there’d be small wonder that he weighs twice as much today
as he did a month ago. I should have to give up my place in time, for fear of
doing my muscles an injury.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“如果他们每天都这样,”强壮的年轻男仆约翰说，“那就不足为奇了，他现在的体重是一个月前的两倍。”。我必须及时放弃我的位置，因为我担心我的肌肉会受伤。”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
That afternoon Mary noticed that something new had happened in Colin’s
room. She had noticed it the day before but had said nothing because she
thought the change might have been made by chance. She said nothing today but
she sat and looked fixedly at the picture over the mantel. She could look at it
because the curtain had been drawn aside. That was the change she noticed.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">那天下午玛丽注意到科林的房间里发生了一些新的事情。她前一天就注意到了，但是一直没有说什么，因为她认为这个改变可能是偶然发生的。她今天什么也没说，只是坐在那里，目不转睛地盯着壁炉架上的那幅画。她可以看看，因为窗帘已经拉开了。这就是她注意到的变化。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“I know what you want me to tell you,” said Colin, after she had
stared a few minutes. “I always know when you want me to tell you
something. You are wondering why the curtain is drawn back. I am going to keep
it like that.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“我知道你想让我告诉你什么,”科林盯着她看了几分钟后说。我总是知道你什么时候想让我告诉你什么。你想知道为什么窗帘拉开了。我会一直保持下去。”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“Why?” asked Mary.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“为什么?”玛丽问。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“Because it doesn’t make me angry any more to see her laughing. I
wakened when it was bright moonlight two nights ago and felt as if the Magic
was filling the room and making everything so splendid that I couldn’t
lie still. I got up and looked out of the window. The room was quite light and
there was a patch of moonlight on the curtain and somehow that made me go and
pull the cord. She looked right down at me as if she were laughing because she
was glad I was standing there. It made me like to look at her. I want to see
her laughing like that all the time. I think she must have been a sort of Magic
person perhaps.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">”因为看到她笑我就不生气了。两天前的晚上，我在明亮的月光下醒来，感觉好像魔法充满了整个房间，把一切都变得如此美好，以至于我无法安静地躺着。我站起来向窗外看去。房间很亮，窗帘上有一片月光，不知怎么的，我就去拉了一下电线。她低头看着我，好像在笑，因为她很高兴我站在那里。这让我喜欢看着她。我想看到她一直那样笑。我想她一定是个有魔力的人。”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“You are so like her now,” said Mary, “that sometimes I think
perhaps you are her ghost made into a boy.”

That idea seemed to impress Colin. He thought it over and then answered her
slowly.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">这个想法似乎给科林留下了深刻的印象。他考虑了一下，然后慢慢地回答她。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“If I were her ghost—my father would be fond of me,” he said.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“如果我是她的鬼魂ーー我父亲会喜欢我的,”他说。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“Do you want him to be fond of you?” inquired Mary.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“你希望他喜欢你吗?”玛丽问道。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“I used to hate it because he was not fond of me. If he grew fond of me I
think I should tell him about the Magic. It might make him more
cheerful.”

“IT’S MOTHER!”<font class="cyxy-trs-target"> “是妈妈!”</font></h2>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
Their belief in the Magic was an abiding thing. After the morning’s
incantations Colin sometimes gave them Magic lectures.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">他们对魔法的信仰是一种持久的东西。在早晨的咒语之后，科林有时给他们上魔法课。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“I like to do it,” he explained, “because when I grow up and
make great scientific discoveries I shall be obliged to lecture about them and
so this is practise. I can only give short lectures now because I am very
young, and besides Ben Weatherstaff would feel as if he were in church and he
would go to sleep.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“我喜欢这样做,”他解释说，“因为当我长大了，有了伟大的科学发现，我就有义务讲授它们，所以这就是实践。我现在只能做简短的演讲，因为我还很年轻，而且本 · 韦瑟斯塔夫会觉得自己好像在教堂里，他会睡着。”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“Th’ best thing about lecturin’,” said Ben, “is
that a chap can get up an’ say aught he pleases an’ no other chap
can answer him back. I wouldn’t be agen’ lecturin’ a bit
mysel’ sometimes.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“说教的好处是,”本说，“一个小伙子可以站起来说任何他想说的话，没有其他小伙子可以回答他。有时候我也不会说教</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
But when Colin held forth under his tree old Ben fixed devouring eyes on him
and kept them there. He looked him over with critical affection. It was not so
much the lecture which interested him as the legs which looked straighter and
stronger each day, the boyish head which held itself up so well, the once sharp
chin and hollow cheeks which had filled and rounded out and the eyes which had
begun to hold the light he remembered in another pair. Sometimes when Colin
felt Ben’s earnest gaze meant that he was much impressed he wondered what
he was reflecting on and once when he had seemed quite entranced he questioned
him.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">但是当科林在他的树下说话的时候，老本盯着他那双贪婪的眼睛，一直盯着他。他用批判的眼光打量着他。让他感兴趣的不是讲座，而是那双每天看起来更直更强壮的腿，那个孩子气的头挺得那么好，那个曾经尖尖的下巴和凹陷的脸颊变得丰满而圆润，那双眼睛开始承载着他记忆中另一双眼睛的光芒。有时，当科林感觉到本认真的凝视意味着他被深深打动时，他想知道自己在思考什么，有一次，当他看起来相当着迷时，他问他。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“What are you thinking about, Ben Weatherstaff?” he asked.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“你在想什么，本 · 韦瑟斯塔夫?”他问。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“I was thinkin’” answered Ben, “as I’d warrant
tha’s gone up three or four pound this week. I was lookin’ at
tha’ calves an’ tha’ shoulders. I’d like to get thee on
a pair o’ scales.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“我在想,”本回答，“我敢保证这个星期你的体重增加了三四磅。我看着你的小腿和肩膀。我要把你放在一对天平上”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“It’s the Magic and—and Mrs. Sowerby’s buns and milk
and things,” said Colin. “You see the scientific experiment has
succeeded.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">科林说: “这是‘魔法’和‘索尔比太太的面包、牛奶和其他东西’，你看，科学实验已经成功了。”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
That morning Dickon was too late to hear the lecture. When he came he was ruddy
with running and his funny face looked more twinkling than usual. As they had a
good deal of weeding to do after the rains they fell to work. They always had
plenty to do after a warm deep sinking rain. The moisture which was good for
the flowers was also good for the weeds which thrust up tiny blades of grass
and points of leaves which must be pulled up before their roots took too firm
hold. Colin was as good at weeding as anyone in these days and he could
lecture while he was doing it.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">那天早晨，迪肯来不及听讲座了。当他来的时候，他已经跑得通红，而且他那滑稽的脸看起来比平时更加闪亮。因为雨后他们有大量的杂草要除，所以他们开始工作。在一场温暖而又深沉的雨后，他们总是有许多事情要做。对花有益的水分也有益于杂草，杂草把小草的叶片和叶子的尖端伸出来，在它们的根扎得太牢固之前，必须把它们拔起来。这些天来，科林和其他人一样擅长除草，他在除草的时候还可以边除草边讲课。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“The Magic works best when you work, yourself,” he said this
morning. “You can feel it in your bones and muscles. I am going to read
books about bones and muscles, but I am going to write a book about Magic. I am
making it up now. I keep finding out things.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">他今天早上说: “当你自己工作的时候，魔术的效果最好。”。“你可以感觉到它在你的骨骼和肌肉。我打算读一些关于骨骼和肌肉的书，但是我打算写一本关于魔法的书。我现在就在编。我一直在寻找答案</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
It was not very long after he had said this that he laid down his trowel and
stood up on his feet. He had been silent for several minutes and they had seen
that he was thinking out lectures, as he often did. When he dropped his trowel
and stood upright it seemed to Mary and Dickon as if a sudden strong thought
had made him do it. He stretched himself out to his tallest height and he threw
out his arms exultantly. Color glowed in his face and his strange eyes widened
with joyfulness. All at once he had realized something to the full.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">他说完这话没多久，就放下了铲子，站了起来。他沉默了好几分钟，他们看到他在像往常一样思考演讲。当他放下手中的铲子，笔直地站着时，玛丽和狄肯似乎突然产生了一种强烈的想法，促使他这样做了。他把自己伸展到最高的高度，兴高采烈地伸出双臂。他的脸色发红，奇怪的眼睛因喜悦而睁大。突然间，他完全明白了一件事。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“Mary! Dickon!” he cried. “Just look at me!”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“玛丽! 迪肯!”他喊道，“看着我!”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
They stopped their weeding and looked at him.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">他们停止除草，看着他。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“Do you remember that first morning you brought me in here?” he
demanded.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“你还记得你把我带到这里的第一个早晨吗?”他问道。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
Dickon was looking at him very hard. Being an animal charmer he could see more
things than most people could and many of them were things he never talked
about. He saw some of them now in this boy.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">迪肯死死地盯着他。作为一个动物迷，他比大多数人能看到更多的东西，其中许多是他从来没有谈论过的东西。他现在在这个男孩身上看到了一些。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“Aye, that we do,” he answered.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“是的，我们有。”他回答。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
Mary looked hard too, but she said nothing.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">玛丽也努力地看着，但她什么也没说。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“Just this minute,” said Colin, “all at once I remembered it
myself—when I looked at my hand digging with the trowel—and I had
to stand up on my feet to see if it was real. And it is real! I’m
<i>well</i>—I’m <i>well!</i>”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“就在这一分钟,”科林说，“我自己突然想起来了ーー当我看着自己用铲子挖东西的时候ーー我不得不站起来看看那是不是真的。而且是真的！我很好，我很好!”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“Aye, that th’ art!” said Dickon.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“是啊，那就是艺术!”迪肯说。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“I’m well! I’m well!” said Colin again, and his face
went quite red all over.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“我很好! 我很好!”科林又说了一遍，他的脸涨得通红。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
He had known it before in a way, he had hoped it and felt it and thought about
it, but just at that minute something had rushed all through him—a sort
of rapturous belief and realization and it had been so strong that he could not
help calling out.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">他以前在某种程度上知道它，他希望它，感觉到它，想到它，但就在那一刻，一种狂喜的信念和领悟冲击着他的全身，它是如此强烈，以至于他忍不住大声呼喊。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“I shall live forever and ever and ever!” he cried grandly.
“I shall find out thousands and thousands of things. I shall find out
about people and creatures and everything that grows—like
Dickon—and I shall never stop making Magic. I’m well! I’m
well! I feel—I feel as if I want to shout out something—something
thankful, joyful!”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“我将永远活着，直到永远!”他大声地哭了起来。”我会发现成千上万的事情。我将了解人类、生物和一切生长的东西ーー就像狄肯ーー我将永远不会停止制作《魔法》。我很好！我很好！我觉得ーー我觉得我好像想大声喊出一些东西ーー一些感恩的、快乐的东西!”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
Ben Weatherstaff, who had been working near a rose-bush, glanced round at him.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">本 · 韦瑟斯塔夫一直在玫瑰花丛附近干活，他向四周看了一眼。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“Tha’ might sing th’ Doxology,” he suggested in his
dryest grunt. He had no opinion of the Doxology and he did not make the
suggestion with any particular reverence.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“你可以唱《教义》 ,”他用最干涩的哼声建议道。他对教义没有任何意见，也没有带着任何特别的敬意提出这个建议。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
But Colin was of an exploring mind and he knew nothing about the Doxology.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">但是科林是一个爱探索的人，他对教义一无所知。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“What is that?” he inquired.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“那是什么?”他问。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“Dickon can sing it for thee, I’ll warrant,” replied Ben
Weatherstaff.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“狄肯可以为你唱，我保证,”本 · 韦瑟斯塔夫回答说。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
Dickon answered with his all-perceiving animal charmer’s smile.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">迪肯用他那全知全能的动物迷人的微笑回答。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“They sing it i’ church,” he said. “Mother says she
believes th’ skylarks sings it when they gets up i’ th’
mornin’.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“他们在教堂里唱这首歌,”他说。“妈妈说她相信云雀早上起来会唱这首歌”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“If she says that, it must be a nice song,” Colin answered.
“I’ve never been in a church myself. I was always too ill. Sing it,
Dickon. I want to hear it.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“如果她这样说，那一定是一首好歌,”科林回答。”我自己从没去过教堂。我一直病得很重。唱吧，迪肯。我想听</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
Dickon was quite simple and unaffected about it. He understood what Colin felt
better than Colin did himself. He understood by a sort of instinct so natural
that he did not know it was understanding. He pulled off his cap and looked
round still smiling.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">迪肯对此十分简单，也不为所动。他比科林自己更理解科林的感受。他的理解是出于一种本能，这种本能是如此自然，以至于他不知道这就是理解。他摘下帽子，仍然面带微笑地环顾四周。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“Tha’ must take off tha’ cap,” he said to Colin,
“an’ so mun tha’, Ben—an’ tha’ mun stand
up, tha’ knows.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“你必须把帽子摘下来,”他对科林说，“班，你必须站起来，你知道的。”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
Colin took off his cap and the sun shone on and warmed his thick hair as he
watched Dickon intently. Ben Weatherstaff scrambled up from his knees and bared
his head too with a sort of puzzled half-resentful look on his old face as if
he didn’t know exactly why he was doing this remarkable thing.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">科林摘下帽子，阳光照射在他头上，温暖了他浓密的头发，他专注地看着迪肯。本 · 韦瑟斯塔夫从膝盖上爬起来，也露出了他的头，老脸上带着一种迷惑不解的半怨恨的表情，好像他不知道自己到底为什么要做这件了不起的事情。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
Dickon stood out among the trees and rose-bushes and began to sing in quite a
simple matter-of-fact way and in a nice strong boy voice:
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">迪肯站在树丛和玫瑰丛中，开始用一种非常简单的、实事求是的方式，用一种很好听的、强壮的男孩嗓音唱道:</p>

<p class="poem cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“Praise God from whom all blessings flow,<br>
Praise Him all creatures here below,<br>
Praise Him above ye Heavenly Host,<br>
Praise Father, Son, and Holy Ghost.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amen.”<br>
</p><p class="poem cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“赞美上帝，一切祝福从他而来，赞美上帝，赞美下面所有的生物，赞美上帝，赞美天主，赞美父亲，儿子，和圣灵。阿门</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
When he had finished, Ben Weatherstaff was standing quite still with his jaws
set obstinately but with a disturbed look in his eyes fixed on Colin.
Colin’s face was thoughtful and appreciative.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">当他说完后，本 · 韦瑟斯塔夫站在那里一动不动，下巴固执地咬着，但眼睛却不安地盯着科林。科林的脸上露出若有所思和感激的神情。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“It is a very nice song,” he said. “I like it. Perhaps it
means just what I mean when I want to shout out that I am thankful to the
Magic.” He stopped and thought in a puzzled way. “Perhaps they are
both the same thing. How can we know the exact names of everything? Sing it
again, Dickon. Let us try, Mary. I want to sing it, too. It’s my song.
How does it begin? ‘Praise God from whom all blessings
flow’?”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“这是一首非常好的歌,”他说。我喜欢。也许这正是我想要大声说出我感谢魔术的意思。”他停下来，困惑地想。“也许它们是一回事。我们怎么知道所有东西的确切名字？再唱一遍，迪肯。让我们试试，玛丽。我也想唱。这是我的歌。怎么开始的？“感谢上帝赐予我们一切”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
And they sang it again, and Mary and Colin lifted their voices as musically as
they could and Dickon’s swelled quite loud and beautiful—and at the
second line Ben Weatherstaff raspingly cleared his throat and at the third line
he joined in with such vigor that it seemed almost savage and when the
“Amen” came to an end Mary observed that the very same thing had
happened to him which had happened when he found out that Colin was not a
cripple—his chin was twitching and he was staring and winking and his
leathery old cheeks were wet.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">他们又唱了一遍，玛丽和科林尽可能地提高音量，迪肯的声音也变得响亮而美丽。在第二行，本 · 韦瑟斯塔夫(Ben Weatherstaff)沙哑地清了清嗓子，在第三行，他加入的声音如此有活力，几乎是野蛮的。当“阿门”结束时，玛丽注意到，同样的事情发生在他身上，当他发现科林不是一个瘸子时，他也发生了同样的事情——他的下巴在抽搐，他在瞪着眼睛，眨着眼睛，苍老的脸颊湿漉漉的。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“I never seed no sense in th’ Doxology afore,” he said
hoarsely, “but I may change my mind i’ time. I should say
tha’d gone up five pound this week Mester Colin—five on
’em!”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“我以前从来没有在教义上没有任何意义,”他沙哑地说，“但是我可能会改变我的想法。科林先生，我得说这个星期你的体重增加了五磅ーー五磅加在他们身上!”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
Colin was looking across the garden at something attracting his attention and
his expression had become a startled one.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">科林正望着花园对面吸引他注意力的东西，他的表情变得吃惊起来。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“Who is coming in here?” he said quickly. “Who is it?”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“谁要进来?”他飞快地说，“是谁?”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
The door in the ivied wall had been pushed gently open and a woman had entered.
She had come in with the last line of their song and she had stood still
listening and looking at them. With the ivy behind her, the sunlight drifting
through the trees and dappling her long blue cloak, and her nice fresh face
smiling across the greenery she was rather like a softly colored illustration
in one of Colin’s books. She had wonderful affectionate eyes which seemed
to take everything in—all of them, even Ben Weatherstaff and the
“creatures” and every flower that was in bloom. Unexpectedly as she
had appeared, not one of them felt that she was an intruder at all.
Dickon’s eyes lighted like lamps.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">爬满常春藤的墙上的门被轻轻地推开了，一个女人走了进来。她带着他们歌曲的最后一行走进来，站在那里一动不动地听着，看着他们。身后是常春藤，阳光穿过树林，把她那件蓝色的长斗篷弄得斑斑驳驳，她那张清新的漂亮脸蛋在绿色的树丛中微笑着，她就像科林书中一幅色彩柔和的插画。她有一双充满爱意的美丽眼睛，似乎把一切都看在眼里ーー包括本 · 韦瑟斯塔夫(Ben Weatherstaff)和那些“生物”以及每一朵盛开的花。出乎意料的是，当她出现的时候，他们没有一个人觉得她是一个入侵者。迪肯的眼睛像灯一样发亮。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“It’s mother—that’s who it is!” he cried and went
across the grass at a run.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“是妈妈，就是她!”他喊道，跑着穿过草地。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
Colin began to move toward her, too, and Mary went with him. They both felt
their pulses beat faster.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">科林也开始向她靠近，玛丽也跟着走了过去。他们都感到自己的脉搏跳得更快了。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“It’s mother!” Dickon said again when they met halfway.
“I knowed tha’ wanted to see her an’ I told her where
th’ door was hid.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“是妈妈!”当他们半路相遇时，迪肯又说了一遍。“我知道你想见她，我告诉了她门藏在哪里”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
Colin held out his hand with a sort of flushed royal shyness but his eyes quite
devoured her face.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">科林伸出他的手，脸上带着一种皇室般的羞涩，但是他的眼睛完全吞噬了她的脸。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“Even when I was ill I wanted to see you,” he said, “you and
Dickon and the secret garden. I’d never wanted to see anyone or anything
before.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“即使在我生病的时候，我也想见你,”他说，“你和迪肯，还有那个秘密花园。我以前从来不想见任何人或任何事。”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
The sight of his uplifted face brought about a sudden change in her own. She
flushed and the corners of her mouth shook and a mist seemed to sweep over her
eyes.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">看到他抬起的脸，她自己也突然变了脸色。她的脸涨得通红，嘴角微微颤抖，眼睛里似乎蒙上了一层薄雾。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“Eh! dear lad!” she broke out tremulously. “Eh! dear
lad!” as if she had not known she were going to say it. She did not say,
“Mester Colin,” but just “dear lad” quite suddenly. She
might have said it to Dickon in the same way if she had seen something in his
face which touched her. Colin liked it.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“呃！亲爱的小伙子!”她颤抖着爆发出来。“呃！亲爱的小伙子!”好像她不知道自己要说出来似的。她没有说“科林先生”，而只是突然地说“亲爱的小伙子”。如果她看到迪肯脸上有什么东西触动了她，她可能也会用同样的方式对他说。科林很喜欢。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“Are you surprised because I am so well?” he asked.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“我身体这么好，你感到惊讶吗?”他问道。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
She put her hand on his shoulder and smiled the mist out of her eyes.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">她把手放在他的肩膀上，微笑着从眼睛里挤出雾气。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“Aye, that I am!” she said; “but tha’rt so like thy

</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“是的，我是!”她说，“但是你太像你的母亲了，你使我的心跳得厉害。”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“Do you think,” said Colin a little awkwardly, “that will
make my father like me?”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“你认为,”科林有点尴尬地说，“这会使我父亲喜欢我吗?”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“Aye, for sure, dear lad,” she answered and she gave his shoulder a
soft quick pat. “He mun come home—he mun come home.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“是的，当然，亲爱的小伙子,”她回答说，轻轻地拍了拍他的肩膀。“他要回家了，他要回家了”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“Susan Sowerby,” said Ben Weatherstaff, getting close to her.
“Look at th’ lad’s legs, wilt tha’? They was like
drumsticks i’ stockin’ two month’ ago—an’ I heard
folk tell as they was bandy an’ knock-kneed both at th’ same time.
Look at ’em now!”

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
Susan Sowerby laughed a comfortable laugh.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">苏珊 · 索尔比舒服地笑了。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“They’re goin’ to be fine strong lad’s legs in a

a finer pair i’ Yorkshire, thank God for it.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“过一会儿他们就会变得非常强壮，小伙子的腿也会变得非常健壮,”她说。“让他继续在花园里玩耍，工作，吃得丰盛，喝大量的甜牛奶，感谢上帝，在约克郡没有比这更好的了。”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
She put both hands on Mistress Mary’s shoulders and looked her little
face over in a motherly fashion.

Mary had not had time to pay much attention to her changing face. She had only
known that she looked “different” and seemed to have a great deal

Susan Sowerby went round their garden with them and was told the whole story of
it and shown every bush and tree which had come alive. Colin walked on one side
of her and Mary on the other. Each of them kept looking up at her comfortable
rosy face, secretly curious about the delightful feeling she gave them—a
sort of warm, supported feeling. It seemed as if she understood them as Dickon
understood his “creatures.” She stooped over the flowers and talked
about them as if they were children. Soot followed her and once or twice cawed
at her and flew upon her shoulder as if it were Dickon’s. When they told
her about the robin and the first flight of the young ones she laughed a
motherly little mellow laugh in her throat.

She had packed a basket which held a regular feast this morning, and when the
hungry hour came and Dickon brought it out from its hiding place, she sat down
with them under their tree and watched them devour their food, laughing and
quite gloating over their appetites. She was full of fun and made them laugh at
all sorts of odd things. She told them stories in broad Yorkshire and taught
them new words. She laughed as if she could not help it when they told her of
the increasing difficulty there was in pretending that Colin was still a
fretful invalid.

“You see we can’t help laughing nearly all the time when we are

Susan Sowerby got up at last to return to the house and Mrs. Medlock. It was

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
In each century since the beginning of the world wonderful things have been
discovered. In the last century more amazing things were found out than in any
century before. In this new century hundreds of things still more astounding
will be brought to light. At first people refuse to believe that a strange new
thing can be done, then they begin to hope it can be done, then they see it can
be done—then it is done and all the world wonders why it was not done
centuries ago. One of the new things people began to find out in the last
century was that thoughts—just mere thoughts—are as powerful as
electric batteries—as good for one as sunlight is, or as bad for one as
poison. To let a sad thought or a bad one get into your mind is as dangerous as
letting a scarlet fever germ get into your body. If you let it stay there after
it has got in you may never get over it as long as you live.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">自世界诞生以来，每个世纪都有奇妙的事物被发现。上个世纪发现的惊人事物比以往任何一个世纪都要多。在这个新世纪，还有数百件更令人震惊的事情将被揭示出来。起初，人们拒绝相信一件奇怪的新事物可以做到，然后他们开始希望它可以做到，然后他们看到它可以做到ーー然后它做到了，所有的世界都想知道为什么几个世纪以前没有做到。人们在上个世纪开始发现的新事物之一是，思想ーー仅仅是思想ーー就像电池一样强大ーー对一个人来说就像阳光一样好，对一个人来说就像毒药一样坏。让一个悲伤的想法或者一个不好的想法进入你的大脑，就像让猩红热病菌进入你的身体一样危险。如果你让它留在那里后，它已经进入你可能永远不会得到它，只要你还活着。</p>

So long as Mistress Mary’s mind was full of disagreeable thoughts about
her dislikes and sour opinions of people and her determination not to be
pleased by or interested in anything, she was a yellow-faced, sickly, bored and
wretched child. Circumstances, however, were very kind to her, though she was
not at all aware of it. They began to push her about for her own good. When her
mind gradually filled itself with robins, and moorland cottages crowded with
children, with queer crabbed old gardeners and common little Yorkshire
housemaids, with springtime and with secret gardens coming alive day by day,
and also with a moor boy and his “creatures,” there was no room
left for the disagreeable thoughts which affected her liver and her digestion
and made her yellow and tired.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">只要玛丽小姐的脑子里充满了她对别人的厌恶和尖酸刻薄的看法以及她对任何事情都不满意和不感兴趣的决心，她就是一个黄脸、多病、无聊和可怜的孩子。然而，环境对她非常友好，尽管她完全没有意识到这一点。他们开始为了她自己的利益把她推来推去。当她的脑海里逐渐充满了知更鸟，荒野小屋里挤满了孩子，有古怪的螃蟹老园丁和普通的约克郡女仆，有春天，有一个秘密的花园日复一日地生机勃勃，还有一个荒野男孩和他的“生物”，没有空间留给那些影响她的肝脏和消化，使她变得黄色和疲惫的不愉快的想法。</p>

So long as Colin shut himself up in his room and thought only of his fears and
weakness and his detestation of people who looked at him and reflected hourly
on humps and early death, he was a hysterical half-crazy little hypochondriac
who knew nothing of the sunshine and the spring and also did not know that he
could get well and could stand upon his feet if he tried to do it. When new
beautiful thoughts began to push out the old hideous ones, life began to come
back to him, his blood ran healthily through his veins and strength poured into
him like a flood. His scientific experiment was quite practical and simple and
there was nothing weird about it at all. Much more surprising things can happen
to anyone who, when a disagreeable or discouraged thought comes into his mind,
just has the sense to remember in time and push it out by putting in an
agreeable determinedly courageous one. Two things cannot be in one place.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">只要科林把自己关在房间里，只想着自己的恐惧和软弱，只想着那些看着他，每时每刻都在反思驼背和早逝的人们，他就是一个歇斯底里的半疯狂的小忧郁症患者，对阳光和春天一无所知，也不知道自己可以好起来，如果他试图这样做，他可以站起来。当新的美好的思想开始推出旧的丑恶的，生活开始回到他身上，他的血液在他的血管里健康地流动，力量像洪水一样涌入他的身体。他的科学实验相当实用和简单，一点也不奇怪。更令人惊讶的事情可能发生在任何一个人身上，当一个不愉快或沮丧的想法进入他的脑海，只是有意识及时记住，并推出一个令人愉快的决心勇敢的一个。两样东西不可能同时出现在一个地方。</p>

While the secret garden was coming alive and two children were coming alive
with it, there was a man wandering about certain far-away beautiful places in
the Norwegian fiords and the valleys and mountains of Switzerland and he was a
man who for ten years had kept his mind filled with dark and heart-broken
thinking. He had not been courageous; he had never tried to put any other
thoughts in the place of the dark ones. He had wandered by blue lakes and
thought them; he had lain on mountain-sides with sheets of deep blue gentians
blooming all about him and flower breaths filling all the air and he had
thought them. A terrible sorrow had fallen upon him when he had been happy and
he had let his soul fill itself with blackness and had refused obstinately to
allow any rift of light to pierce through. He had forgotten and deserted his
home and his duties. When he traveled about, darkness so brooded over him that
the sight of him was a wrong done to other people because it was as if he
poisoned the air about him with gloom. Most strangers thought he must be either
half mad or a man with some hidden crime on his soul. He, was a tall man with a
drawn face and crooked shoulders and the name he always entered on hotel
registers was, “Archibald Craven, Misselthwaite Manor, Yorkshire,
England.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">当秘密花园开始活跃，两个孩子也开始活跃起来的时候，一个男人正在挪威峡谷和瑞士山区某些遥远美丽的地方游荡，这个男人十年来一直保持着黑暗和心碎的思想。他并不勇敢，他从来没有试图把任何其他的想法放在黑暗的地方。他曾经在蓝色的湖边漫步，思考着它们; 他曾经躺在山坡上，四周开满了深蓝色的龙胆花，空气中弥漫着花的呼吸，他思考着它们。当他快乐的时候，一种可怕的悲伤降临在他身上，他让自己的灵魂充满了黑暗，并且顽固地拒绝让任何光的裂缝穿透。他忘记了自己的家，抛弃了自己的职责。当他四处旅行时，黑暗笼罩着他，看到他对其他人来说是一种错误，因为他好像用阴郁毒害了周围的空气。大多数陌生人认为他要么是半疯半傻，要么就是一个灵魂中隐藏着罪恶的人。他身材高大，面容憔悴，肩膀弯曲，他总是在酒店登记簿上输入的名字是: “阿奇博尔德 · 克雷文，Misselthwaite Manor，约克郡，英格兰。”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
He had traveled far and wide since the day he saw Mistress Mary in his study
and told her she might have her “bit of earth.” He had been in the
most beautiful places in Europe, though he had remained nowhere more than a few
days. He had chosen the quietest and remotest spots. He had been on the tops of
mountains whose heads were in the clouds and had looked down on other mountains
when the sun rose and touched them with such light as made it seem as if the
world were just being born.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">从他在书房里看到玛丽小姐的那一天起，他就四处旅行，告诉她，她可能拥有她的“一点土地”他去过欧洲最美丽的地方，虽然他只在那里呆了几天。他选择了最安静最偏僻的地方。当太阳升起来的时候，他曾经站在云端的山顶上，俯视着其他的山峰，用阳光照耀着它们，使它们看起来好像世界刚刚诞生。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
But the light had never seemed to touch himself until one day when he realized
that for the first time in ten years a strange thing had happened. He was in a
wonderful valley in the Austrian Tyrol and he had been walking alone through
such beauty as might have lifted, any man’s soul out of shadow. He had
walked a long way and it had not lifted his. But at last he had felt tired and
had thrown himself down to rest on a carpet of moss by a stream. It was a clear
little stream which ran quite merrily along on its narrow way through the
luscious damp greenness. Sometimes it made a sound rather like very low
laughter as it bubbled over and round stones. He saw birds come and dip their
heads to drink in it and then flick their wings and fly away. It seemed like a
thing alive and yet its tiny voice made the stillness seem deeper. The valley
was very, very still.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">但是那道光似乎从来没有触碰过他自己，直到有一天，他意识到十年来第一次发生了一件奇怪的事情。他在奥地利 Tyrol 的一个美丽的山谷里，独自一人走过这样的美景，任何人的灵魂都可能从阴影中走出来。他走了很长一段路，但是他的脚还是没有抬起来。但是最后他感到很累，于是他在一条小溪边的苔藓地毯上躺了下来。那是一条清澈的小溪，在甘美潮湿的绿色中，沿着狭窄的道路欢快地流淌着。有时它发出一种非常低沉的笑声，像是在石头上翻滚。他看见鸟儿飞过来，低下头喝水，然后振翅飞走了。它看起来像是一个有生命的东西，然而它微小的声音使得这种寂静显得更加深沉。山谷非常，非常安静。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
As he sat gazing into the clear running of the water, Archibald Craven
gradually felt his mind and body both grow quiet, as quiet as the valley
itself. He wondered if he were going to sleep, but he was not. He sat and gazed
at the sunlit water and his eyes began to see things growing at its edge. There
was one lovely mass of blue forget-me-nots growing so close to the stream that
its leaves were wet and at these he found himself looking as he remembered he
had looked at such things years ago. He was actually thinking tenderly how
lovely it was and what wonders of blue its hundreds of little blossoms were. He
did not know that just that simple thought was slowly filling his
mind—filling and filling it until other things were softly pushed aside.
It was as if a sweet clear spring had begun to rise in a stagnant pool and had
risen and risen until at last it swept the dark water away. But of course he
did not think of this himself. He only knew that the valley seemed to grow
quieter and quieter as he sat and stared at the bright delicate blueness. He
did not know how long he sat there or what was happening to him, but at last he
moved as if he were awakening and he got up slowly and stood on the moss
carpet, drawing a long, deep, soft breath and wondering at himself. Something
seemed to have been unbound and released in him, very quietly.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">当阿奇博尔德 · 克雷文坐在那里凝视着清澈的流水时，他渐渐感觉到自己的心灵和身体都安静了下来，就像山谷本身一样安静。他不知道自己是否要睡觉，但是他没有。他坐着凝视着阳光照耀下的水面，他的眼睛开始看到水面边缘生长的东西。有一大片蓝色勿忘我草长得离小溪很近，叶子都湿了。看着这些草，他发现自己看上去就像多年前看过这些东西一样。他实际上在温柔地思考它是多么可爱，它的数百朵小花是多么奇妙的蓝色。他不知道，就是这个简单的想法慢慢地充满了他的脑海ーー不断地充满，直到其他事情被轻轻地推到一边。就好像一股甘甜清澈的泉水在一潭死水中开始升腾，一直升腾，直到最后把黑暗的水冲走。当然，他自己并没有想到这一点。他只知道，当他坐着凝视着那明亮而精致的蓝色时，山谷似乎变得越来越安静了。他不知道自己在那里坐了多久，也不知道自己身上发生了什么事情，但最后，他像是醒来了一样，慢慢地站起来，站在苔藓地毯上，长长地、深深地、轻轻地吸了一口气，自己在思考着什么。似乎有什么东西在他体内解开了束缚，悄无声息地释放了出来。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“What is it?” he said, almost in a whisper, and he passed his hand
over his forehead. “I almost feel as if—I were alive!”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“这是什么?”他说，几乎是在耳语，然后他把他的手放在他的前额上。“我几乎觉得自己还活着!”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
I do not know enough about the wonderfulness of undiscovered things to be able
to explain how this had happened to him. Neither does anyone else yet. He did
not understand at all himself—but he remembered this strange hour months
afterward when he was at Misselthwaite again and he found out quite by accident
that on this very day Colin had cried out as he went into the secret garden:
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">我对未被发现的事物的美妙了解不够，无法解释这是如何发生在他身上的。其他人也不知道。他自己也不明白ーー但他记得几个月后的这个奇怪的时刻，当他再次来到 Misselthwaite 的时候，他意外地发现，就在这一天，当他走进秘密花园的时候，科林大叫了起来:</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“I am going to live forever and ever and ever!”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“我要永远永远永远永远地活下去!”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
The singular calmness remained with him the rest of the evening and he slept a
new reposeful sleep; but it was not with him very long. He did not know that it
could be kept. By the next night he had opened the doors wide to his dark
thoughts and they had come trooping and rushing back. He left the valley and
went on his wandering way again. But, strange as it seemed to him, there were
minutes—sometimes half-hours—when, without his knowing why, the
black burden seemed to lift itself again and he knew he was a living man and
not a dead one. Slowly—slowly—for no reason that he knew
of—he was “coming alive” with the garden.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">那天晚上剩下的时间里，他一直保持着一种奇特的平静，他又睡了一个安稳的觉，但是这种平静并没有持续多久。他不知道它可以保存。到了第二天晚上，他已经把自己的黑暗思想的大门敞开了，它们成群结队地赶回来了。他离开了山谷，继续他的流浪之路。但是，奇怪的是，有那么几分钟，有时候是半个小时，在他不知道为什么的情况下，黑色的负担似乎又重新抬起来了，他知道自己是一个活人，而不是一个死人。慢慢地ーー慢慢地ーー他不知道为什么ーー他在花园里“活跃起来”。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
As the golden summer changed into the deep golden autumn he went to the Lake of
Como. There he found the loveliness of a dream. He spent his days upon the
crystal blueness of the lake or he walked back into the soft thick verdure of
the hills and tramped until he was tired so that he might sleep. But by this
time he had begun to sleep better, he knew, and his dreams had ceased to be a
terror to him.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">当金色的夏天变成深金色的秋天时，他去了科摩湖。在那里，他发现了梦的美丽。他整天呆在水晶般湛蓝的湖面上，或者走回柔软茂密的山丘上，一直走到累了才能睡着。但是他知道，这时他已经开始睡得好些了，他的梦对他来说已经不再是一件可怕的事了。</p>

“Perhaps,” he thought, “my body is growing stronger.”

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
It was growing stronger but—because of the rare peaceful hours when his
thoughts were changed—his soul was slowly growing stronger, too. He began
to think of Misselthwaite and wonder if he should not go home. Now and then he
wondered vaguely about his boy and asked himself what he should feel when he
went and stood by the carved four-posted bed again and looked down at the
sharply chiseled ivory-white face while it slept and, the black lashes rimmed
so startlingly the close-shut eyes. He shrank from it.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">他的灵魂正在变得越来越强大，但是由于他的思想改变了，他的灵魂也在慢慢变得越来越强大。他开始想起 Misselthwaite，不知道自己是否应该回家。他时不时地模糊地想起他的儿子，问自己，当他再次站在雕花的四柱床边，低头看着睡着时轮廓分明的象牙白的脸，黑色的睫毛让紧闭的眼睛有了惊人的边缘时，他会有什么感觉。他退缩了。</p>

One marvel of a day he had walked so far that when he returned the moon was
high and full and all the world was purple shadow and silver. The stillness of
lake and shore and wood was so wonderful that he did not go into the villa he
lived in. He walked down to a little bowered terrace at the water’s edge
and sat upon a seat and breathed in all the heavenly scents of the night. He
felt the strange calmness stealing over him and it grew deeper and deeper until
he fell asleep.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">奇迹的一天，他走了这么远，当他回来的时候，月亮又高又圆，整个世界都是紫色的影子和银色的。湖泊、岸边和树林的宁静是如此美妙，以至于他没有走进他居住的别墅。他走到水边的一个小露台上，坐在一张椅子上，呼吸着夜晚所有天堂般的气息。他感到一种奇怪的平静悄悄地向他袭来，而且越来越深，直到他睡着了。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
He did not know when he fell asleep and when he began to dream; his dream was
so real that he did not feel as if he were dreaming. He remembered afterward
how intensely wide awake and alert he had thought he was. He thought that as he
sat and breathed in the scent of the late roses and listened to the lapping of
the water at his feet he heard a voice calling. It was sweet and clear and
happy and far away. It seemed very far, but he heard it as distinctly as if it
had been at his very side.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">他不知道自己什么时候睡着，什么时候开始做梦; 他的梦是如此真实，以至于他感觉不到自己在做梦。后来，他想起了自己曾经以为自己是多么地清醒和机警。他想，当他坐在那里，呼吸着晚开的玫瑰花的芬芳，听着脚下的水声时，他听到了一个声音在呼唤。它是甜蜜的，清晰的，快乐的，遥远的。它似乎很远，但他听得很清楚，仿佛它就在他的身边。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“Archie! Archie! Archie!” it said, and then again, sweeter and
clearer than before, “Archie! Archie!”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“阿奇! 阿奇! 阿奇!”它说，然后又说了一遍，比以前更甜蜜更清晰，“阿奇! 阿奇!”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
He thought he sprang to his feet not even startled. It was such a real voice
and it seemed so natural that he should hear it.

And then the dream ended. But he did not awaken. He slept soundly and sweetly
all through the lovely night. When he did awake at last it was brilliant
morning and a servant was standing staring at him. He was an Italian servant
and was accustomed, as all the servants of the villa were, to accepting without
question any strange thing his foreign master might do. No one ever knew when
he would go out or come in or where he would choose to sleep or if he would
roam about the garden or lie in the boat on the lake all night. The man held a
salver with some letters on it and he waited quietly until Mr. Craven took
them. When he had gone away Mr. Craven sat a few moments holding them in his
hand and looking at the lake. His strange calm was still upon him and something
more—a lightness as if the cruel thing which had been done had not
happened as he thought—as if something had changed. He was remembering
the dream—the real—real dream.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">然后梦结束了。但他没有醒来。整个可爱的夜晚，他睡得又香又甜。当他终于醒来的时候，天已经亮了，一个仆人站在那里盯着他。他是一个意大利仆人，和别墅里所有的仆人一样，习惯于毫无疑问地接受他的外国主人可能做的任何奇怪的事情。没有人知道他什么时候会出去，什么时候会进来，或者他会选择在哪里睡觉，或者他会在花园里漫步，或者整夜躺在湖上的小船上。那人手里拿着一个托盘，托盘上有几封信，他静静地等着，直到克雷文先生把信拿走。他走后，克雷文先生坐了一会儿，手里拿着他们，望着湖。他那奇怪的平静依然笼罩着他，而且还有更多的东西ーー一种轻松，好像那件残酷的事情并没有像他想象的那样发生ーー好像有什么事情发生了变化。他想起了那个梦ーー那个真实的ーー真实的梦。</p>

“In the garden!” he said, wondering at himself. “In the

When he glanced at the letters a few minutes later he saw that the one lying at
the top of the rest was an English letter and came from Yorkshire. It was
directed in a plain woman’s hand but it was not a hand he knew. He opened
it, scarcely thinking of the writer, but the first words attracted his
attention at once.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">几分钟后，他瞥了一眼那些信，发现最上面的那封是一封英文信，来自约克郡。这是一个普通女人的手，但他不知道这是一只手。他打开信，几乎没有想到作者，但第一句话立刻引起了他的注意。</p>

In a few days he was in Yorkshire again, and on his long railroad journey he
found himself thinking of his boy as he had never thought in all the ten years
past. During those years he had only wished to forget him. Now, though he did
not intend to think about him, memories of him constantly drifted into his
mind. He remembered the black days when he had raved like a madman because the
child was alive and the mother was dead. He had refused to see it, and when he
had gone to look at it at last it had been, such a weak wretched thing that
everyone had been sure it would die in a few days. But to the surprise of those
who took care of it the days passed and it lived and then everyone believed it
would be a deformed and crippled creature.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">过了几天，他又回到了约克郡，在他漫长的铁路旅途中，他发现自己想起了他的儿子，这是他过去十年来从未想过的。在那些年里，他只想忘记他。现在，虽然他不打算想起他，但是关于他的记忆不断地浮现在他的脑海里。他记得那些黑暗的日子，那时他像个疯子一样胡言乱语，因为孩子还活着，母亲已经死了。他拒绝看它，当他最后去看它的时候，它已经变成了一个软弱可怜的东西，每个人都以为它会在几天内死去。但令照顾它的人惊讶的是，日子一天天过去，它还活着，然后每个人都相信它会是一个畸形和残废的生物。</p>

He had not meant to be a bad father, but he had not felt like a father at all.
He had supplied doctors and nurses and luxuries, but he had shrunk from the
mere thought of the boy and had buried himself in his own misery. The first
time after a year’s absence he returned to Misselthwaite and the small
miserable looking thing languidly and indifferently lifted to his face the
great gray eyes with black lashes round them, so like and yet so horribly
unlike the happy eyes he had adored, he could not bear the sight of them and
turned away pale as death. After that he scarcely ever saw him except when he
was asleep, and all he knew of him was that he was a confirmed invalid, with a
vicious, hysterical, half-insane temper. He could only be kept from furies
dangerous to himself by being given his own way in every detail.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">他并不想成为一个坏父亲，但他一点也不觉得自己像个父亲。他提供医生、护士和奢侈品，但是他一想到那个男孩就退缩了，把自己埋葬在自己的痛苦之中。一年之后，他第一次回到了 Misselthwaite，这个看起来很可怜的小家伙懒洋洋地，无动于衷地抬起他的脸，灰色的大眼睛，黑色的睫毛环绕着它们，如此相似，但又如此可怕地不像他曾经喜欢的那双快乐的眼睛，他无法忍受看到它们，转过脸去，脸色苍白得像死了一样。从那以后，除了睡觉的时候，他几乎再也见不到他了，他所知道的就是，他是一个确定无疑的病人，脾气暴躁，歇斯底里，半疯半癫。只有在每一个细节上都按照自己的意愿行事，他才不会被愤怒所伤害。</p>

All this was not an uplifting thing to recall, but as the train whirled him
through mountain passes and golden plains the man who was “coming
alive” began to think in a new way and he thought long and steadily and
deeply.

“Perhaps I have been all wrong for ten years,” he said to himself.
“Ten years is a long time. It may be too late to do anything—quite
too late. What have I been thinking of!”

Of course this was the wrong Magic—to begin by saying “too
late.” Even Colin could have told him that. But he knew nothing of
Magic—either black or white. This he had yet to learn. He wondered if
Susan Sowerby had taken courage and written to him only because the motherly
creature had realized that the boy was much worse—was fatally ill. If he
had not been under the spell of the curious calmness which had taken possession
of him he would have been more wretched than ever. But the calm had brought a
sort of courage and hope with it. Instead of giving way to thoughts of the
worst he actually found he was trying to believe in better things.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">当然，这是错误的魔法ーー一开始就说“太晚了”连科林都可以告诉他。但他对魔法一无所知ーー不管是黑魔法还是白魔法。这一点他还没有学会。他不知道苏珊 · 索尔比之所以鼓起勇气写信给他，是否只是因为这位慈母意识到这个男孩的病情要严重得多ーー已经病入膏肓。如果他没有中了那种奇怪的平静的魔咒，他会比以往任何时候都更加痛苦。但是这种平静带来了一种勇气和希望。他没有屈服于最坏的想法，而是试图相信更好的事情。</p>

But when on his way across the moor he stopped the carriage at the cottage,
seven or eight children who were playing about gathered in a group and bobbing
seven or eight friendly and polite curtsies told him that their mother had gone
to the other side of the moor early in the morning to help a woman who had a
new baby. “Our Dickon,” they volunteered, was over at the Manor
working in one of the gardens where he went several days each week.

Mr. Craven looked over the collection of sturdy little bodies and round
red-cheeked faces, each one grinning in its own particular way, and he awoke to
the fact that they were a healthy likable lot. He smiled at their friendly

The drive across the wonderfulness of the moor was a soothing thing. Why did it
seem to give him a sense of homecoming which he had been sure he could never
feel again—that sense of the beauty of land and sky and purple bloom of
distance and a warming of the heart at drawing, nearer to the great old house
which had held those of his blood for six hundred years? How he had driven away
from it the last time, shuddering to think of its closed rooms and the boy
lying in the four-posted bed with the brocaded hangings. Was it possible that
perhaps he might find him changed a little for the better and that he might
overcome his shrinking from him? How real that dream had been—how
wonderful and clear the voice which called back to him, “In the

When he arrived at the Manor the servants who received him with the usual

“That’s it, sir. He’s growing very peculiar—when you
compare him with what he used to be. He used to eat nothing and then suddenly
he began to eat something enormous—and then he stopped again all at once
and the meals were sent back just as they used to be. You never knew, sir,
perhaps, that out of doors he never would let himself be taken. The things
we’ve gone through to get him to go out in his chair would leave a body
trembling like a leaf. He’d throw himself into such a state that Dr.
Craven said he couldn’t be responsible for forcing him. Well, sir, just
without warning—not long after one of his worst tantrums he suddenly
insisted on being taken out every day by Miss Mary and Susan Sowerby’s
boy Dickon that could push his chair. He took a fancy to both Miss Mary and
Dickon, and Dickon brought his tame animals, and, if you’ll credit it,
sir, out of doors he will stay from morning until night.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">就是这样，先生。他变得非常奇怪ーー当你把他和过去的他相比较的时候。他以前什么也不吃，然后突然开始大吃特吃ーー然后他又突然停下来，饭菜照原样送回来了。也许你永远不会知道，先生，他永远不会让自己被带出门外。我们为了让他坐上轮椅所做的一切都会让他的身体颤抖得像片树叶。他会让自己陷入这种状态以至于克雷文医生说他不能为强迫他负责。是这样的，先生，只是在毫无预兆的情况下ーー在他最大的一次发脾气后不久，他突然坚持每天都要被玛丽小姐和苏珊 · 索尔比的儿子迪肯带出去，那个迪肯可以推他的椅子。他喜欢上了玛丽小姐和迪肯，迪肯带来了他驯服的动物，如果你相信的话，先生，他会从早到晚呆在户外。”</p>

“How does he look?” was the next question.

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“If he took his food natural, sir, you’d think he was putting on
flesh—but we’re afraid it may be a sort of bloat. He laughs
sometimes in a queer way when he’s alone with Miss Mary. He never used to
laugh at all. Dr. Craven is coming to see you at once, if you’ll allow
him. He never was as puzzled in his life.”

He had to make an effort to bring himself back to the place he was standing in
and when he felt he was on earth again he turned and went out of the room. He
took his way, as Mary had done, through the door in the shrubbery and among the
laurels and the fountain beds. The fountain was playing now and was encircled
by beds of brilliant autumn flowers. He crossed the lawn and turned into the
Long Walk by the ivied walls. He did not walk quickly, but slowly, and his eyes
were on the path. He felt as if he were being drawn back to the place he had so
long forsaken, and he did not know why. As he drew near to it his step became
still more slow. He knew where the door was even though the ivy hung thick over
it—but he did not know exactly where it lay—that buried key.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">他不得不努力使自己回到原来的位置，当他感到自己又回到了地球上时，他转身走出了房间。他像玛利亚一样，穿过灌木丛中的门，穿过月桂树和喷泉床。喷泉现在正在喷水，周围是灿烂的秋天的花坛。他穿过草坪，拐进爬满常青藤的墙边的长路。他并没有走得很快，而是走得很慢，他的眼睛一直盯着小路。他觉得自己好像被拉回了那个他早已抛弃的地方，他不知道为什么。当他走近它的时候，他的脚步变得更慢了。他知道那扇门在哪里，尽管上面长满了常春藤，但他不知道那把埋在地下的钥匙到底在哪里。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
So he stopped and stood still, looking about him, and almost the moment after
he had paused he started and listened—asking himself if he were walking
in a dream.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">于是他停了下来，一动不动地站着，环顾四周。几乎在他停下来的那一刻，他开始听了起来ーー问自己是不是在做梦。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
The ivy hung thick over the door, the key was buried under the shrubs, no human
being had passed that portal for ten lonely years—and yet inside the
garden there were sounds. They were the sounds of running scuffling feet
seeming to chase round and round under the trees, they were strange sounds of
lowered suppressed voices—exclamations and smothered joyous cries. It
seemed actually like the laughter of young things, the uncontrollable laughter
of children who were trying not to be heard but who in a moment or so—as
their excitement mounted—would burst forth. What in heaven’s name
was he dreaming of—what in heaven’s name did he hear? Was he losing
his reason and thinking he heard things which were not for human ears? Was it
that the far clear voice had meant?
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">常春藤厚厚地挂在门上，钥匙埋在灌木丛里，孤独的十年里没有人通过那个入口ーー然而在花园里却有声音。那是奔跑的脚步声，似乎在树下追来追去，那是压低声音发出的奇怪声音ーー感叹声和窒息的欢呼声。实际上，这似乎是年轻人的笑声，是孩子们无法控制的笑声，他们尽量不让别人听到，但随着他们的兴奋程度不断上升，过一会儿就会爆发出来。他究竟梦到了什么? 他究竟听到了什么？他是不是失去了理智，认为自己听到了不属于人类的东西？是那个远远清晰的声音的意思吗？</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
And then the moment came, the uncontrollable moment when the sounds forgot to
hush themselves. The feet ran faster and faster—they were nearing the
garden door—there was quick strong young breathing and a wild outbreak of
laughing shouts which could not be contained—and the door in the wall was
flung wide open, the sheet of ivy swinging back, and a boy burst through it at
full speed and, without seeing the outsider, dashed almost into his arms.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">然后那个时刻来了，那个无法控制的时刻，声音忘记了让自己安静下来。他们的脚越跑越快ーー他们正在接近花园的门ーー年轻人呼吸急促而有力，一阵狂笑的叫喊声不受控制地爆发出来ーー墙上的门被猛地打开，一片常春藤向后摆动，一个男孩全速冲了进来，没有看到外人，几乎冲进了他的怀里。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
Mr. Craven had extended them just in time to save him from falling as a result
of his unseeing dash against him, and when he held him away to look at him in
amazement at his being there he truly gasped for breath.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">克雷文先生及时地把它们伸展开来，使他免于因无视的冲撞而跌倒。当他把他拉开，惊讶地看着他时，他真的喘不过气来。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
He was a tall boy and a handsome one. He was glowing with life and his running
had sent splendid color leaping to his face. He threw the thick hair back from
his forehead and lifted a pair of strange gray eyes—eyes full of boyish
laughter and rimmed with black lashes like a fringe. It was the eyes which made
Mr. Craven gasp for breath.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">他是个高个子的男孩，长得很英俊。他生气勃勃，他的奔跑使他的脸色一下子变得光彩夺目。他把前额浓密的头发往后一甩，抬起一双奇怪的灰色眼睛ーー眼睛里充满了孩子气的笑声，黑色的睫毛像刘海一样镶边。是那双眼睛让克雷文先生喘不过气来。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“Who—What? Who!” he stammered.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“谁? 什么? 谁!”他结结巴巴地说。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
This was not what Colin had expected—this was not what he had planned. He
had never thought of such a meeting. And yet to come dashing out—winning
a race—perhaps it was even better. He drew himself up to his very
tallest. Mary, who had been running with him and had dashed through the door
too, believed that he managed to make himself look taller than he had ever
looked before—inches taller.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">这不是科林所期望的ーー这不是他所计划的。他从来没有想到过这样一个会议。然而冲出去ーー赢得一场比赛ーー也许更好。他把自己拉到最高的地方。玛丽一直跟着他跑，也冲进了门，她相信他成功地让自己看起来比以往任何时候都高——几英寸。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“Father,” he said, “I’m Colin. You can’t believe
it. I scarcely can myself. I’m Colin.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“爸爸,”他说，“我是科林。你不会相信的。我自己都不敢相信。我是科林。”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
Like Mrs. Medlock, he did not understand what his father meant when he said
hurriedly:
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">和梅德洛克夫人一样，他不明白父亲匆忙说:</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“In the garden! In the garden!”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“在花园里! 在花园里!”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“Yes,” hurried on Colin. “It was the garden that did
it—and Mary and Dickon and the creatures—and the Magic. No one
knows. We kept it to tell you when you came. I’m well, I can beat Mary in
a race. I’m going to be an athlete.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“是的,”科林急忙说。“是花园做到了这一点ーー还有玛丽、狄肯和那些生物ーー还有魔法。没人知道。我们留着它是为了告诉你你什么时候来。我很好，我能在比赛中击败玛丽。我要成为一名运动员。”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
He said it all so like a healthy boy—his face flushed, his words tumbling
over each other in his eagerness—that Mr. Craven’s soul shook with
unbelieving joy.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">他说起这一切来就像一个健康的男孩ーー他的脸涨得通红，他的话因为他的急切而互相打断ーー克雷文先生的灵魂因为难以置信的喜悦而颤抖起来。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
Colin put out his hand and laid it on his father’s arm.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">科林伸出手，放在他父亲的胳膊上。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“Aren’t you glad, Father?” he ended. “Aren’t you
glad? I’m going to live forever and ever and ever!”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“你不高兴吗，父亲?”他结束了。“你不高兴吗? 我将永远永远永远地活着!”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
Mr. Craven put his hands on both the boy’s shoulders and held him still.
He knew he dared not even try to speak for a moment.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">克雷文先生把双手放在男孩的双肩上，一动不动地扶着他。他知道他一刻也不敢说话。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“Take me into the garden, my boy,” he said at last. “And tell
me all about it.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“带我到花园里去，我的孩子,”他最后说，“把一切都告诉我。”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
And so they led him in.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">所以他们就把他带进来了。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
The place was a wilderness of autumn gold and purple and violet blue and
flaming scarlet and on every side were sheaves of late lilies standing
together—lilies which were white or white and ruby. He remembered well
when the first of them had been planted that just at this season of the year
their late glories should reveal themselves. Late roses climbed and hung and
clustered and the sunshine deepening the hue of the yellowing trees made one
feel that one, stood in an embowered temple of gold. The newcomer stood silent
just as the children had done when they came into its grayness. He looked round
and round.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">那地方是一片金黄色、紫色、紫蓝色和火红色的荒野，四周是一束束晚熟的百合花，白色、白色和红宝石色的百合花。他清楚地记得，当第一棵树被种下的时候，就在这个季节，它们晚年的辉煌将会显现出来。晚开的玫瑰攀爬着，挂着，簇拥着，阳光加深了发黄的树木的色调，使人觉得自己站在一座金色的建筑里。新来的人静静地站着，就像孩子们进入灰色地带时所做的那样。他环顾四周。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“I thought it would be dead,” he said.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“我以为它会死掉,”他说。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“Mary thought so at first,” said Colin. “But it came
alive.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“玛丽一开始是这么想的,”科林说，“但是它活过来了。”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
Then they sat down under their tree—all but Colin, who wanted to stand
while he told the story.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">然后他们在树下坐了下来ーー除了科林，他想站着听他讲故事。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
It was the strangest thing he had ever heard, Archibald Craven thought, as it
was poured forth in headlong boy fashion. Mystery and Magic and wild creatures,
the weird midnight meeting—the coming of the spring—the passion of
insulted pride which had dragged the young Rajah to his feet to defy old Ben
Weatherstaff to his face. The odd companionship, the play acting, the great
secret so carefully kept. The listener laughed until tears came into his eyes
and sometimes tears came into his eyes when he was not laughing. The Athlete,
the Lecturer, the Scientific Discoverer was a laughable, lovable, healthy young
human thing.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">这是他听过的最奇怪的事情，阿奇博尔德 · 克雷文想，因为它是以男孩子的方式倒出来的。神秘、魔法和野生动物，诡异的午夜会议ーー春天的到来ーー受到侮辱的骄傲激情把年轻的拉贾拽起来，当着他的面公然反抗老本 · 韦瑟斯塔夫。古怪的友谊，戏剧表演，这个伟大的秘密如此小心翼翼地保守着。听众大笑，直到眼泪进入他的眼睛，有时眼泪进入他的眼睛时，他不笑。运动员、讲师、科学发现者是一个可笑的、可爱的、健康的年轻人。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“Now,” he said at the end of the story, “it need not be a
secret any more. I dare say it will frighten them nearly into fits when they
see me—but I am never going to get into the chair again. I shall walk
back with you, Father—to the house.”<br><br>
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“现在,”他在故事的结尾说，“这不再是一个秘密了。我敢说，当他们看到我的时候，他们会吓得几乎发抖ーー但我再也不会坐到轮椅上去了。我会和你一起回去的，父亲，回家去”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
Ben Weatherstaff’s duties rarely took him away from the gardens, but on
this occasion he made an excuse to carry some vegetables to the kitchen and
being invited into the servants’ hall by Mrs. Medlock to drink a glass of
beer he was on the spot—as he had hoped to be—when the most
dramatic event Misselthwaite Manor had seen during the present generation
actually took place.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">本 · 韦瑟斯塔夫的工作很少让他离开花园，但这次他找了个借口，把一些蔬菜搬到厨房，并被梅德洛克夫人邀请到仆人大厅喝一杯啤酒。正如他所希望的那样，当 Misselthwaite Manor 这一代人所看到的最具戏剧性的事件真的发生时，他就在现场。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
One of the windows looking upon the courtyard gave also a glimpse of the lawn.
Mrs. Medlock, knowing Ben had come from the gardens, hoped that he might have
caught sight of his master and even by chance of his meeting with Master Colin.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">从一扇窗户可以看到庭院，还可以瞥见草坪。梅德洛克太太知道本是从花园里来的，她希望他能看到他的主人，甚至有机会见到科林少爷。</p>

“Did you see either of them, Weatherstaff?” she asked.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“韦瑟斯塔夫，你看见他们两个了吗?”她问。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
Ben took his beer-mug from his mouth and wiped his lips with the back of his
hand.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">本从嘴里拿出啤酒杯，用手背擦了擦嘴唇。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“Aye, that I did,” he answered with a shrewdly significant air.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“是的，我做到了,”他回答说，带着一种精明的意味深长的神气。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“Both of them?” suggested Mrs. Medlock.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“他们两个?”梅德洛克太太建议道。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“Both of ’em,” returned Ben Weatherstaff. “Thank ye
kindly, ma’am, I could sup up another mug of it.”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“他们两个,”本 · 韦瑟斯塔夫回答说，“非常感谢，夫人，我可以再喝一杯。”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“Together?” said Mrs. Medlock, hastily overfilling his beer-mug in
her excitement.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“一起?”梅德洛克太太兴奋地急忙给他的啤酒杯加满酒，说道。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“Together, ma’am,” and Ben gulped down half of his new mug at
one gulp.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“一起喝，女士,”本一口气喝下了半个新杯子。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“Where was Master Colin? How did he look? What did they say to each
other?”
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">“科林少爷在哪里? 他看起来怎么样? 他们对彼此说了什么?”</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
“I didna’ hear that,” said Ben, “along o’ only

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
And it was not two minutes before he swallowed the last of his beer and waved
his mug solemnly toward the window which took in through the shrubbery a piece
of the lawn.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">不到两分钟，他就把最后一瓶啤酒咽了下去，郑重其事地向窗口挥了挥杯子，窗口透过灌木丛看到了草坪的一角。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
When Mrs. Medlock looked she threw up her hands and gave a little shriek and
every man and woman servant within hearing bolted across the servants’
hall and stood looking through the window with their eyes almost starting out
of their heads.
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">梅德洛克太太一看，就举起双手，发出一声轻微的尖叫。听到这声音的男女仆人纷纷穿过仆人们的大厅，站在那里向窗外张望，眼睛都快瞪出来了。</p>

<p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-source-ted">
Across the lawn came the Master of Misselthwaite and he looked as many of them
had never seen him. And by his side with his head up in the air and his eyes
full of laughter walked as strongly and steadily as any boy in
Yorkshire—Master Colin!<br><br>
</p><p class="cyxy-trs-source cyxy-trs-target">草坪对面走来了 Misselthwaite 的主人，他看起来就像许多人从未见过他一样。在他的身边，他昂着头，眼睛里充满了笑意，他走起路来像约克郡的任何一个男孩一样坚定而稳健ーー科林少爷！</p>
