<p>Oh, God, I hate this part.</p><p>Just be cool.</p><p>I can barely walk with all the crap you've taped to my thighs.</p><p>Well, there was another place to hide it, but you're too dainty.</p><p>I told you that's exit only.</p><p>Next, please. </p><p>Here we go.</p><p>Welcome back to the United States. Is your trip for business or pleasure?</p><p>Pleasure. Business. Business. Pleasure.</p><p>The point is, we're thrilled to be back.</p><p>God bless America! Home of our ancestors!</p><p>And the birthplace of jazz.</p><p>Okay. Whose bag is this?</p><p>My Mom's.</p><p>No, I'm pretty sure that's yours, honey. See? It's got your nametag right on it.</p><p>Yeah, but that's not my bag.</p><p>Well, it certainly ain't mine, muchacha.</p><p>Well, what do we have here?</p><p>Christy! How could you?!</p><p>What?! This is not my bag, and I've never seen that before!</p><p>Oh, sweetheart, did prison teach you nothing?</p><p>I've never been to prison!</p><p>Look, I don't want to tell you how to do your job, but check her thighs... their street value is $80,000.</p><p>What?! </p><p>You sold me out to the Feds!</p><p>Oh, honey... are you drinking again?</p><p>No, I just dreamt that you and I were smuggling dr’Ωg from Mexico, and when it went bad, you made me take the fall!</p><p>Oh, how awful.</p><p>It is!</p><p>You know, when you were a little girl and had a bad dream, I let you crawl in bed with me until you felt safe.</p><p>You did?</p><p>I did. But now you're a fully grown crazy person, so I'm just gonna hang up!</p><p>Mom? Of all the things to yell at my mother for, I had to pick the one that didn't happen.</p><p>Hey, Mom, I just wanted to call and say I'm sorry for yelling at you.</p><p>I know it was just a dream, but it seemed so real.</p><p>Hang on. I gotta spit.</p><p>Anyway, call me back... unless you're gonna punish me with silence, which is so you.</p><p>Probably what you're doing right now. Well, you know what? It's not gonna work. I'm not gonna let you get in my head.</p><p>Go to hell! </p><p>That's gonna come back and bite me in the ass.</p><p>Why aren't you dressed? We're gonna be late.</p><p>My underpants are crunchy.</p><p>What do you mean, "crunchy"?</p><p>I don't know what happened. They were soft yesterday.</p><p>Oh, honey, you can't keep wearing the same underwear. Put on some clean ones.</p><p>I don't have any clean ones. </p><p>And you're telling me this 5 minutes before you have to leave for school?</p><p>I'm as surprised as you are.</p><p>All right. Let's go see if your sister has a pair you can borrow.</p><p>I'm not wearing Violet's underpants!</p><p>No one will know!</p><p>I'll know.</p><p>Violet, do you have any old underwear Roscoe could wear?</p><p>Seriously? You haven't screwed him up enough?</p><p>It's a "yes or no" question.</p><p>So was mine.</p><p>Forget it; I'll just buy him some on the way to school.</p><p>Ugh, that reminds me, I'm gonna need some money for some new jeans. </p><p>I'm, like, seriously bloated lately.</p><p>Violet, you're, like, seriously pregnant lately. </p><p>And you have a job. You want new jeans, spend your own money.</p><p>I'm not wasting my money on fat pants.</p><p>Oh, so you're okay to waste mine?</p><p>Well, I was hoping...</p><p>Listen, Juno... ...the minute you got pregnant, life as you know it ended.</p><p>It's time you got ready for the dream-sucking monster which is about to shoot out of your hoo-ha and gobble up your life!</p><p>You're a horrible woman.</p><p>And soon you'll be one, too!</p><p>Ah, here. Clean underwear.</p><p>I don't want to wear these.</p><p>What's wrong with them?</p><p>They have anchors.</p><p>What's wrong with anchors?</p><p>They're stupid.</p><p>Oh, for God's sake, it's just a design. It doesn't mean anything.</p><p>Well, I like my underwear to make sense.</p><p>I'm not having this conversation with you.</p><p>Then who is?</p><p>Excuse me, can my son change in your bathroom?</p><p>We don't have a bathroom.</p><p>Of course you have a bathroom.</p><p>Come on. Help me out here.</p><p>Sorry, it's not for public use.</p><p>Okay, look, I'm in a hurry. I gotta get him to school. Can't you make an exception?</p><p>I don't make the rules.</p><p>No, but you have a brain and you could use it now to help my little boy put on a pair of clean underpants!</p><p>Mom, it's okay.</p><p>I got this, Roscoe!</p><p>I don't think you do. Why don't I just change in the car?</p><p>No, you are gonna change... ...right here!</p><p>In the store? I'm not an animal.</p><p>Go ahead! No one can see!</p><p>Ma'am, he can't take his clothes off in here.</p><p>Want to bet?</p><p>Take your clothes off in here.</p><p>Please don't make me call security.</p><p>No, no, go ahead. I want you to. In fact, I'll do it for you.</p><p>Security! Nine-year-old changing into anchor underpants in aisle eleven! Shoot to kill!</p><p>You're a horrible woman.</p><p>Oh, like I haven't heard that today from some other bitch!</p><p>Go ahead, honey. Go on, change.</p><p>So one regular coffee and a latte.</p><p>You know, sweetie, you'd be so much prettier if you smiled once in a while!</p><p>Excuse me?</p><p>Show a little teeth. Brighten the world up!</p><p>I'm sorry; I'll certainly give that a try.</p><p>Try it now! There you go! Was that so hard? </p><p>It's amazing you got to teach a broad who works for tips basic courtesy.</p><p>You look really pretty today. Did you change your hair?</p><p>Bite me!</p><p>Is it just me, or do crazy waitresses give you a woody?</p><p>Christy, right?</p><p>Yeah. How'd you know my name?</p><p>We met at your first meeting. I'm Marjorie.</p><p>I'm sorry. I spent most of that meeting crying and vomiting into my purse.</p><p>And you wonder why I remember your name. How's it going now?</p><p>Well, got a new purse.</p><p>Very nice.</p><p>Unfortunately, that's about the only thing I got going for me.</p><p>Sorry to hear it.</p><p>Did you ever have one of those days where everyone you meet is a gigantic ass?</p><p>Everyone, huh?</p><p>Yeah. My mom, my kids, the people at work, even some idiot clerk at the 99-Cent Store.</p><p>Yeah, I've had days like that, and you know what I finally figured out?</p><p>What?</p><p>If everyone I meet's an ass... maybe I'm the ass.</p><p>Wait... you're saying I'm the problem?</p><p>You're very quick.</p><p>Oh, God, I am the ass.</p><p>Okay, everyone, I think we're ready to get started. </p><p>Please remember there is no parking in the lot adjacent to the building....</p><p>You know, I get that I have to take responsibility for my life, </p><p>but you have no idea what it was like growing up with my mother.</p><p>I'm sure it was a nightmare, but you're not a child anymore.</p><p>I know that, but she makes me so mad! You got two options, sweetie:</p><p>you can stay angry at your mother and be miserable for the rest of your life, or you can let it go and be happy.</p><p>Isn't there a third option?</p><p>Hi, Mom. </p><p>Hello.</p><p>Thanks for meeting me.</p><p>Oh, sure.</p><p>Um, listen, I want to apologize for yelling at you the other day.</p><p>That's it? That's all you're gonna say?</p><p>Anyway, I feel terrible.</p><p>Just "terrible"?</p><p>What do you mean? </p><p>Well, I would think you'd feel ashamed, as well.</p><p>Okay. Ashamed.</p><p>Maybe a little dopey.</p><p>Dopey, Doc and sneezy. Are we good?</p><p>I came in here good.</p><p>Whatever. Let's just eat. Lunch is on me. </p><p>It's my way of showing I'm letting go of my anger.</p><p>That's very generous of you.</p><p>Of course, if I were flush with cash, I might buy my pregnant daughter new jeans, but you're doing some "tough love" thing... I get it.</p><p>You talked to Violet?</p><p>She tweeted it.</p><p>And did you defend me?</p><p>Nope, I just retweeted and moved on.</p><p>Right there. That's where my dream comes from. </p><p>You never, ever have my back. You always put your needs ahead of mine.</p><p>Well, I certainly hope the salmon is more satisfying than your apology.</p><p>Don't growl, sweetheart; it's not very ladylike.</p><p>Hey, buddy. I went and did all your laundry, so you have nice, fresh clothes for tomorrow.</p><p>No need to thank me. Are you giving me the cold, silent treatment, like your Grandma does?</p><p>No, I'm doing a puzzle and it's hard.</p><p>You know, I'm really sorry I haven't been on top of getting the laundry done.</p><p>Or making sure we have peanut butter.</p><p>Oh, are we out of peanut butter?</p><p>And jelly.</p><p>Okay.</p><p>And bread. </p><p>Hey, can I help?</p><p>Sure.</p><p>You know... I want you to know that I will always be there for you, no matter what.</p><p>Nothing you do could make me love you less.</p><p>Even if I grow up to be like Dad?</p><p>Oh, honey... the fact that you're doing a puzzle means you won't end up like your Dad.</p><p>How's the cheesecake?</p><p>Awesome!</p><p>Do you like it, Violet? It's your favorite.</p><p>I tell you I don't fit into my pants, so you buy me cheesecake?</p><p>I was just trying to do something nice for you. Whatever.</p><p>You know, Violet... your mom's making a real effort, here, and you're not giving her much to work with.</p><p>Are you taking her side?</p><p>It's okay, Luke.</p><p>No, no, no. There are no sides when it comes to family. </p><p>We're a circle. Or a triangle... ...but that would have sides, so a circle.</p><p>Luke, for your own sake, stay out of this.</p><p>Well, Christy, I am this. You know, everyone says you're all moody 'cause you're pregnant, </p><p>but they're wrong. You've always been moody.</p><p>Why don't you go take out the garbage?</p><p>Yes, dear. I learned to say that from watching TV.</p><p>Do you believe him?</p><p>Yeah, that was pretty stupid.</p><p>Do guys get smarter over time?</p><p>Oh, honey... if they have the love of a good woman, all things are possible... I'm sorry, I can't lie to you! No.</p><p>Chef Rudy? I want you to know that I'm aware I've been kind of bitchy lately, and I'm working on it. I'm trying to be a better person.</p><p>Appreciate the sentiment. And good luck with that.</p><p>Thank you.</p><p>Are you thinking what I'm thinking?</p><p>Gabriel, you got a sec?</p><p>Not if you're gonna snap my head off.</p><p>I'm really sorry about that. I was having a bad day, and... I didn't mean to take it out on you. You don't deserve that.</p><p>I miss you, too!</p><p>no. That's not where I'm going with this.</p><p>I want to hold you so much right now!</p><p>I'm trying to apologize, not turn you on.</p><p>Too late!</p><p>Gabriel, listen to me. You and I are done. Over.  Finito.</p><p>Excuse me. Miss? I'm not sure if you remember me...</p><p>I remember.</p><p>Yeah, I bet you do. I want to apologize. Your job's tough enough without some jerk like me telling you to smile.</p><p>Seriously?</p><p>Yeah, it's really been eating at me. I hope you'll accept my apology.</p><p>Yes. I do. Thanks so much. You've really made my day.</p><p>Great.</p><p>Have a nice lunch. I so wish I hadn't spit in his latte.</p><p>Hi, Marjorie.</p><p>Ah, there she is.</p><p>I just wanted to thank you for talking to me the other day. Your advice really helped.</p><p>Oh, yeah?</p><p>Yeah. Once I let go of my anger, everyone suddenly got nicer.</p><p>Aw. Good for you. Anger is a luxury people like us cannot afford.</p><p>Hi, sweetie.</p><p>Hi, Mom. Do you two know each other?</p><p>We've, crossed paths. Hello, Marjorie.</p><p>Bonnie.</p><p>Marjorie made cookies.</p><p>Thanks for the warning. Good-bye, Marjorie.</p><p>Bonnie. That's your mother?</p><p>Yeah.</p><p>No wonder you drank.</p><p>Excuse me, could I talk to you for second?</p><p>Look, lady, I don't want any problems.</p><p>No, no, no. I came here to apologize. I was very rude the other day.</p><p>Anyway, there's no excuse for it, but,  once again, I'm sorry.</p><p>Wow, I've been working here six years and this has never happened.</p><p>People come in, they just treat you like you're nothing, </p><p>and then... go about their business, buying cotton balls and tube socks. </p><p>Well, you do get a lot of tube sock for your money here.</p><p>But you came back to apologize.</p><p>To be fair, I also needed toenail clippers.</p><p>It doesn't matter. Thank you.</p><p>can I use your bathroom now? </p><p>Please don't exploit our friendship.</p>
