<p>Are we ready to order? Yeah, I think so. Sis?</p><p>You go first.</p><p>Thanks for putting me on the spot. My sister does this to me all the time.</p><p>Okay.</p><p>Family, huh?</p><p>Yep.</p><p>Yeah. Okay, let's see. I would like the scallop risotto since I am not allergic to shellfish, unlike my sister.</p><p>Idiot.</p><p>Good choice. </p><p>Thanks, yeah. We're celebrating her divorce. Now we're both single.</p><p>Oh, that's nice. I hope my son and daughter can be there for each other when their spouses inevitably turn on them.</p><p>Oh, you have children. I love children. I believe they're our future.</p><p>So, how about you? Do, do you have a spouse who turned on you?</p><p>Oh, yeah, lot of hard feelings. Ah, terrific. </p><p>Can I grab you for just a sec?</p><p>I'll be right back. He probably needs me to open up a jar of pickles or something.</p><p>Ooh. Okay, well, bye.</p><p>Was that guy hitting on you?</p><p>Yeah, he absolutely was.</p><p>Thought so. I'll ask Richard to take the table.</p><p>Why? </p><p>I don't want him bothering you.</p><p>He's not. Is he bothering you?</p><p>No, I'm just protective of you 'cause you and I have, you know, something special going on.</p><p>Yeah, it's called adultery.</p><p>Why do you make it sound so cheap and ugly?</p><p>Oh, I'm sorry. Unicorns, rainbows, you're cheating on your wife.</p><p>I told you they were doing it.</p><p>And another thing. you have no right to tell me who I can and cannot see.</p><p>What are you saying? We're not monogamous?</p><p>Gabriel, you're married.</p><p>We do it once a month, and I don't even take off my T-shirt.</p><p>Let me make it simple for you. All of this stuff here is in play.</p><p>Oh, that's good thinking.</p><p>Uh, Gabriel, Paul and I would like you to give us money not to tell your wife you're banging Christy.</p><p>A lot of money.</p><p>Hey, sis, look who's back.</p><p>Give it a rest. So, what's the deal with your brother? Good guy, whack job?</p><p>Give it to me straight. I'm a single mom and I don't have a lot of time.</p><p>He's amazing. I'd go out with him, you know, if it didn't make us hillbillies.</p><p>All right. I'll write my phone number on the check.</p><p>Hold on a second. What makes you think I was even trying to ask you out?</p><p>You weren't? Oh, uh, this is, this is awkward. Let me get you a new server.</p><p>Wait, now, I was just trying to be cool!</p><p>Mission accomplished!</p><p>This is a cute top.</p><p>Oh, that's actually a party dress from my drinking days.</p><p>Wow. Were you drinking when you bought it?</p><p>I hope so. Anyway, it doesn't matter, I'm not that kind of girl anymore.</p><p>Hello. What kind of girl were you when you wore this?</p><p>Popular. Oh, my God, I hate everything in my closet! </p><p>It all looks like Halloween in Slutsylvania.</p><p>Calm down, we'll find something. Okay, so tell me about this guy tonight.</p><p>I don't know. Cute, kind of boyish, pretty normal really.</p><p>You just described every serial killer.</p><p>No! He loves his sister, which I take as a good sign.</p><p>Boing, my gay-dar just went off.</p><p>He's not gay. He puts ketchup on his steak.</p><p>I don't get what you're so jittery about. You know how to do this.</p><p>I know how to do this drunk.</p><p>Come on, you've been dating your boss since you got sober.</p><p>You can't call what we do dating. It's just sеx in uncomfortable places.</p><p>I hope you mean broom closets.</p><p>Yes.</p><p>Oh, Mom, God! The point is, Gabriel's married, so there's no future with him.</p><p>But this guy tonight, who knows?</p><p>We could wind up with a little house, picket fence, missionary sеx twice a week.</p><p>You know, I had sеx with a missionary once and oddly he was not a fan of that position.</p><p>Thank you for that image.</p><p>I'm just worried that if he finds out the kind of person I was, he won't like me.</p><p>Oh, honey.</p><p>I know, it's silly.</p><p>It's not silly. you should definitely lie about your past.</p><p>What?</p><p>Yeah, sometimes I like to tell guys I'm Carole Anne Stevenson from Albuquerque, New Mexico.</p><p>You're kidding.</p><p>Nope, Carole's a schoolteacher like her mother and her Aunt Judy.</p><p>She loves baking and gardening and volunteering down at the homeless shelter.</p><p>Now tell me about this.</p><p>That's actually yours.</p><p>Are you taking the prenatal vitamins we got you?</p><p>Did you stop smoking pot and drinking?</p><p>Of course.</p><p>Don't bite my head off. Not everybody does.</p><p>Thanks for looking after Roscoe tonight. Yeah, whatever.</p><p>You're really wearing that on a date?</p><p>What's wrong with it?</p><p>You look like a slutty highlighter.</p><p>You know what? I think I look great, and that's all that matters.</p><p>Where are you going?</p><p>Where do you think? To change!</p><p>Why are you being such a bitch?</p><p>I'm just being honest.</p><p>Good, I'll be honest, too. You're being a bitch. </p><p>And I use that word instead of the word I want to use because you're my granddaughter and I love you.</p><p>What, so I'm supposed to make a big deal just because she's going out with some random guy?</p><p>Excuse me, young lady, but your mother going out with some random guy is the only reason you exist. </p><p>And I'll tell you another thing.</p><p>if she doesn't meet somebody, she's going to turn into one of those crazy old ladies with 20 cats who lives with their daughter. </p><p>You're going to be chasing her down the street, trying to pin her robe shut.</p><p>Better? </p><p>Damn it.</p><p>Mom, wait.</p><p>What?</p><p>Why don't you try on that black dress in my closet? I think it'll look cute on you.</p><p>Thank you.</p><p>Well, look at you being a nice person. </p><p>I'll tell you what. As a reward, why don't you go out with Luke tonight and I'll watch Roscoe?</p><p>You don't have plans? </p><p>at my age, when you've had sеx in the afternoon, you're good for the whole day.</p><p>If our waitress is cute, it's totally okay to say I'm your sister.</p><p>No, I'm good. Have you ever eaten here before?</p><p>No, I haven't. How about you?</p><p>No.</p><p>Ah, look at us. We already have something in common.</p><p>Yeah.</p><p>So, what do you do?</p><p>Oh, yeah, I'm, I'm a civil engineer.</p><p>Wow! </p><p>Yeah.</p><p>I have no idea why I said wow 'cause I don't know what that is.</p><p>Oh, okay, uh, well, today, for instance, the city decided that it needed a new stoplight, </p><p>so it's my job to go over all the contracts with the stoplight manufacturers </p><p>and just get the best price for the stoplight.</p><p>That sounds crazy.</p><p>No, it's pretty boring.</p><p>No, no, no, it's not. From now on, every time I stop at a red light, I'll think of you.</p><p>Oh, so that'll be often.</p><p>Not really, I tend to just blow right through 'em.</p><p>Good evening, folks. Can I start you off with a cocktail or some wine?</p><p>Yes, would you like a drink?</p><p>No, thank you.</p><p>Ah, come on, live a little.</p><p>Oh, you can live a little for both of us.</p><p>No, don't be silly. Glass of wine never hurt anyone.</p><p>I don't drink, not because I don't want to but because I can't. </p><p>It wrecked my life, it destroyed my relationships, and I'm still picking up the pieces, </p><p>but if you want a glass of wine, you go right ahead. Won't bother me at all. I'm his sister.</p><p>So once I finally quit drinking, I had all these feelings come up, and I didn't know how to deal with them, so I started eating. </p><p>Every night after work I'd come home, I'd take a bag of salt-and-vinegar potato chips, I'd hit it with a book so it was just crumbs, and I'd mix it with a pint of vanilla ice cream. </p><p>I gained 18 pounds in, like, a month. </p><p>Then in the middle of the night, I woke up and I thought I had a cat on my lap, looked down turns out it was my own stomach.</p><p>I don't think I can do this.</p><p>It's our first date.</p><p>So, Okay, you've got an eight, and I give you a seven, how many is that? </p><p>Fifteen. </p><p>Very good. Now, the house is showing a face card.</p><p>And you're the house.</p><p>Yes, I am. How much you want to bet?</p><p>All of it. On a 15. </p><p>Interesting. Ooh! Another eight. How many is that?</p><p>Twenty three?</p><p>But the name of the game is...?</p><p>"Twenty One."</p><p>Exactly.</p><p>Thanks for watching Roscoe. We'll see you later.</p><p>Hey, hang on. You listen to me, teen Jesus, I want my granddaughter back by 11:00 with her hymen intact.</p><p>What?!</p><p>I'm just screwing with you. You already knocked her up; do whatever you want.</p><p>I know that was supposed to be funny, but I peed myself a little.</p><p>Sorry, sir, only players at the table.</p><p>I want to play more Blackjack.</p><p>Okay. Ante up.</p><p>I can't. I don't have any more money.</p><p>No money? Or no money on you?</p><p>I have some in my piggy bank.</p><p>Well, it's not doing you any good in there, is it?</p><p>Be right back.</p><p>Wait'll I teach him how to play Pai Gow.</p><p>Oh, God, I'm gonna die alone. Please let it be now.</p><p>Open the door.</p><p>Damn it! </p><p>Hey. Hope you're hungry, 'cause I... brought us dinner.</p><p>What? </p><p>How? As I was chasing you out of the restaurant, I bought a guy's to-go order.</p><p>Really?</p><p>Yeah. That's so adorable. And or... desperate.</p><p>Well, let's go with adorable. 'Cause I really want you to like me.</p><p>Okay, let's see what we're having for dinner. This looks like some kind of chicken.</p><p>Ooh, I love some kind of chicken.</p><p>Yeah? Okay, okay. And I have a pasta, looks like, uh, Bolognese.</p><p>Ooh, I like that, too!</p><p>You want to switch?</p><p>No, no, no. Well, yeah.</p><p>no, there are no utensils.</p><p>Oh. Check the glove compartment. I eat in my car a lot.</p><p>Oh. Ooh. Fancy.</p><p>Okay, time for bed. I'll tell you what, just to show you how much we appreciate your business, we're gonna comp your room.</p><p>Come on, just one more game.</p><p>Well, sorry, buddy, but you're broke.</p><p>Well, um, how about if you lend me five dollars and I'll pay you back when I win?</p><p>Oh, sweetheart, you're gonna grow up and make some nice lady so sad.</p><p>How about if I sell you my iPod?</p><p>That might work.</p><p>Hey. </p><p>What can I do for you, Baxter? </p><p>Just came to see my kid.</p><p>Hey, Dad, can you lend me some money?</p><p>That's so weird... I was gonna ask you the same thing.</p><p>I'm gonna hang with you guys for a bit.</p><p>Here's a question for you.</p><p>Shoot. </p><p>What's wrong with you that you would chase a crazy lady out of a restaurant with a bag of someone else's food?</p><p>Why does something have to be wrong with me for me to like you?</p><p>Nice try. Answer the question.</p><p>No, seriously, I thought we really made a connection in there.</p><p>Answer the question.</p><p>Okay, uh, well, I did just get out of a relationship.</p><p>That's what I'm talking about.</p><p>Tell me about it. she was very nice. Sweet. No drama.</p><p>Um... Her name wasn't Carol Anne Stevenson, was it?</p><p>Yeah, why?</p><p>No reason. Continue.</p><p>Anyway, uh, she was great, but in all the time we were together, she never once told me how she was feeling. Whereas you, literally, can't stop telling me.</p><p>I'm sorry. I feel terrible.</p><p>See? You just did it again.</p><p>Okay, but in my defense, I am emotionally all over the place.</p><p>Oh, wow! There it is again.</p><p>And I am dealing with a number of personal crises which you really don't need to know about, but I feel like I'm gonna tell you anyway. </p><p>What is wrong with me? Why can't I stop talking?</p><p>Well, that shut me up. Nice.</p><p>Yeah. Now what? Now you get out of my car.</p><p>Why? I love it in here.</p><p>I'm sorry. This is good, you're good, but I am clearly not ready to start dating.</p><p>I wish I could disagree.</p><p>But I want you to know that when I am... you are at the top of my list. And the list isn't very long. In fact, it's just you.</p><p>Great. You're not as crazy as you think you are.</p><p>That's the nicest thing anyone's ever said to me.</p><p>Run. </p><p>What do you want to do with that soft 19?</p><p>I'll hold.</p><p>Hold? What's that?</p><p>It means you have a number you like, and you're not gonna take any more cards.</p><p>You can hold?</p><p>I'll get it.</p><p>I was never here!</p><p>You can hold?!</p><p>Oh. Hi, is Christy here?</p><p>Who might be asking?</p><p>Um, I work with her.</p><p>Oh. You must be her boss.</p><p>I am.</p><p>You leave your wife yet?</p><p>No.</p><p>Then I have no choice but to inform you that she is out on a date with a wealthy, educated, eligible bachelor who's got a cannon between his legs.</p><p>So her mom's not a fan.</p><p>by focusing on the positive, I attract only the best into my life. By focusing on the positive...</p><p>Oh, my God!</p><p>Oh!</p><p>Are you okay?</p><p>Uh, I think you broke my foot. And maybe my nose.</p><p>Oh! Sorry, sorry. Okay, don't move. I'm gonna call an ambulance.</p><p>No, wait! My wife can't know I was here.</p><p>Okay, well, um, let's get you in the car, and I'll take you to the emergency room.</p><p>Ow! Careful. Careful.</p><p>it hurts pretty bad, huh?</p><p>It's awful.</p><p>Well, then this probably isn't a great time to say this, but, um, I don't think we should see each other anymore.</p><p>Wait, you're breaking up with me? Why?!</p><p>Well, I found out something about myself tonight.</p><p>I deserve to be in a relationship with a man who I can hit with my car, and you know, not feel like I did something wrong.</p><p>Okay, I'm not sure what that means, but...</p><p>What?! </p><p>There's a fork in ass!</p><p>knocky-knocky.</p><p>Hi. How's your little boss?</p><p>Oh, I broke his leg and his nose.</p><p>Admit it, it felt pretty good, didn't it?</p><p>No! No, no, no. A little bit.</p><p>I got you a gift.</p><p>Thanks. What's the occasion?</p><p>Well, I know you don't feel ready to date for a while. I thought this might put a little spring in your step.</p><p>What is it?</p><p>Thank you. Do you mind finishing the dishes?</p><p>My pleasure. I am such a good mother.</p>
