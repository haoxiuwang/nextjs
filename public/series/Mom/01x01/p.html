<p>I think you'll find our Napa Chardonnay to have hints of vanilla and caramel with a velvety smooth finish.</p><p>Are you all right?</p><p>Some days are better than others. Thanks for asking.</p><p>It's very good.</p><p>Yeah, 2004 was a great year for this wine. Not so much for me. Enjoy.</p><p>So, did I talk you into that souffl√©?</p><p>Uh, yeah, two.</p><p>Good call. You won't want to share. Oh, God.</p><p>More butter and salt. They only need to live long enough to pay the check.</p><p>Beat those egg whites gently as if they were a small, annoying child.</p><p>Paul, you're on fire again.</p><p>Um, Christy, you got a second?</p><p>I can't talk now, Gabriel. I'm working.</p><p>Yeah, I know, but, uh, here's the thing. I'm getting a lot of complaints.</p><p>Really? About what?</p><p>Well, apparently, one of my waitresses is having a nervous breakdown.</p><p>Is it Jennifer?</p><p>Is it Carol?</p><p>It's you!</p><p>Gabriel, what does this taste like to you?</p><p>Uh, mushrooms?</p><p>The correct answer was "ass."</p><p>Listen, maybe you should take the rest of the night off.</p><p>I can't afford to do that. I have children to feed.</p><p>Not a problem. Grab a couple steaks, head home and feed 'em.</p><p>You don't understand. The guy at table 4 said something horrible to me when I was telling him about the salmon.</p><p>What's wrong with the salmon? Nothing, the salmon's great!</p><p>The guy insulted me.</p><p>Oh, that's fine.</p><p>What did he say?</p><p>He said I was "a good waitress."</p><p>That's not bad. Or true.</p><p>I didn't grow up to be a "good waitress"</p><p>That was never the plan.</p><p>The plan was to be a psychologist.</p><p>Okay. You're a young woman. You can still do that.</p><p>Yeah, maybe. I'd probably have to graduate high school first.</p><p>Now all I've got to look forward to is serving $60 risotto to a bunch of smug food Nazis.</p><p>I mean, who are we kidding? It's a big, steaming pile of gooey rice!</p><p>What did you say?</p><p>Get over yourself, Rudy. I saw you at McDonald's going down on a Big Mac.</p><p>First of all, it was a Filet-O-Fish.</p><p>And for you?</p><p>I'd like the pounded capon with lemongrass and thyme.</p><p>Excellent choice. You know that's a castrated chicken they beat with a hammer.</p><p>Daily affirmations.</p><p>I open my heart and allow wonderful things to flow into my life.</p><p>My daughter's an easy lay and it's not my fault.</p><p>I'm sorry. Did I wake you?</p><p>That's okay. How was work?</p><p>Oh, fun. I feel guilty taking the money. What'd you do tonight?</p><p>Not much. Did my homework, watched TV.</p><p>Is there a TV on your ceiling?</p><p>What?</p><p>Sit down. We need to talk.</p><p>What's up?</p><p>Violet, I can't tell you not to have sex at your age, because I had sex at your age.</p><p>Mom, I'm not having sex.</p><p>Don't lie to the woman who washes your sheets.</p><p>And in case you've forgotten, I got pregnant with you when I was a teenager.</p><p>And please don't take this the wrong way, It ruined my life.</p><p>I love you, too, Mom?</p><p>And I can't tell you not to drink and smoke pot, because my senior yearbook quote was:</p><p>"Let's drink and smoke pot"</p><p>Can this please be over?</p><p>You don't know how lucky you are. My mother never bothered to talk to me about this stuff.</p><p>Yeah, this is over.</p><p>Honey, I just don't want you to wake up one day and feel bad 'cause you're not a psychologist!</p><p>Okay, good talk!</p><p>Let's get you back in your own bed.</p><p>Hi, Mom.</p><p>Hi, sweetie.</p><p>I waited up for you.</p><p>Thank you.</p><p>Violet's boyfriend was over.</p><p>I know.</p><p>They were kissing.</p><p>I'm sure they were.</p><p>They took a shower together.</p><p>Terrific.</p><p>Are you coming to my talent show tomorrow?</p><p>Tomorrow? What time?</p><p>11:00.</p><p>Oh, honey, I have to work the lunch shift.</p><p>It's okay. I'm not good anyway.</p><p>Listen, maybe I can get someone to cover my shift.</p><p>Don't worry about it.</p><p>No, I want you to be able to look out into the audience and see me, because that</p><p>way you'll know how much I...</p><p>Mommy, I'm sleeping.</p><p>Good talk.</p><p>You feeling better?</p><p>Oh, yeah. My home is a real oasis.</p><p>So, am I in trouble with Chef Rudy?</p><p>He'll be fine. He bought an eight ball and took home the pastry chef.</p><p>Sleeping with your boss. Who does that?</p><p>Mom...?</p><p>Yeah, honey?</p><p>I had a bad dream.</p><p>Oh, no, well, um... why don't you go back to bed and I'll come lay down with you in a second?</p><p>I'm so sorry. I owe you one.</p><p>Don't lay there too long. The sprinklers come on in ten minutes.</p><p>What the hell?</p><p>Can I help you?</p><p>What time is the talent show?</p><p>What talent show?</p><p>There's no talent show today?</p><p>I don't think so.</p><p>Are you freaking kidding me?!</p><p>I lost a day's pay for no reason?</p><p>Maybe we were destined to meet.</p><p>It would definitely be the high point of my day.</p><p>Roscoe!</p><p>Hi, Mom.</p><p>What are you doing here?</p><p>The talent show?</p><p>That's not today.</p><p>But you said it was!</p><p>Guess I was wrong.</p><p>I guess you were.</p><p>Don't you kids tease him about this.</p><p>Son of a bitch!</p><p>Oh, God, I need a drink.</p><p>Hi, I'm Christy and I'm an alcoholic.</p><p>I've been sober 118 days. Oh, don't applaud for that. They've been the worst 118 days of my life.</p><p>The only reason I'm here is because, I didn't want to turn into my mother.</p><p>And I did anyway. Yeah, I drank like her. I went through men like her. Um, I was selfish to my kids just like she was.</p><p>And I didn't know how to live any other way because she was my only role model.</p><p>I mean, some mothers teach their daughters how to bake.</p><p>Mine taught me how to beat a cavity search and still feel like a lady.</p><p>Anyway, thanks for letting me share.</p><p>And I cannot tell you how comforting it is to be in a room with people who are just as screwed up as I am, so...</p><p>Oh, stop it.</p><p>Hi, I'm Jim and I'm an alcoholic.</p><p>Aren't you a little old to be blaming all your problems on your mother?</p><p>Hi, Mom.</p><p>Hi, I'm Greg. May I take your order?</p><p>Hi, Greg. I'm Bonnie and this is my daughter, Christy.</p><p>She and I haven't spoken in a couple of years, so this is kind of a big moment for us.</p><p>Oh, for God's sake.</p><p>What can you recommend for a mother and daughter who are reconnecting after</p><p>a long, angry silence?</p><p>Mom, please, just order.</p><p>Um, is the mint tea decaffeinated?</p><p>Do you promise? If I have caffeine after 2:00, my sleep in ruined.</p><p>I promise.</p><p>Okay, Greg, but if I wake up in the middle of the night, I'm calling you.</p><p>Well, I'll give you my number.</p><p>Um, and for you? We have a lovely selection of local wines.</p><p>I'll have a bottle of each and a funnel.</p><p>She's kidding. We're both in Alcoholics Anonymous.</p><p>Mom, it's Alcoholics Anonymous, not Alcoholics Tell Your Waiter.</p><p>Water is fine. Here, take this knife away from me.</p><p>So, when were you going to tell me you quit drinking?</p><p>Well, I was afraid if I called you, I'd just start again.</p><p>Not that you care, but I have two years clean and sober myself.</p><p>You're right, I don't care.</p><p>Well, regardless, it has really changed my life.</p><p>I have a steady job. I exercise. I'm in a book club!</p><p>I have become the kind of woman I've always hated.</p><p>It is nice to see you wearing underwear. And not on your head.</p><p>Here we go.</p><p>Oh, Greg, honey, can I trouble you for some water without ice? Ice isn't good for my digestive system.</p><p>Yeah, of course.</p><p>Really? Ice? I think your digestive system has seen worse than ice.</p><p>Excuse me?</p><p>Mom, I've watched you lick cocaine crumbs out of a shag carpet.</p><p>It's not a sin to be thrifty, dear.</p><p>Okay, here we go. Now, I hope that you're being nice to your mother.</p><p>Go away, Greg!</p><p>Right.</p><p>You know, just because you're sober doesn't mean you can't take a Xanax.</p><p>Actually, Mom, it sort of does.</p><p>Really? Maybe I don't have two years.</p><p>And I don't need a Xanax, I'm doing great.</p><p>Well, that's funny, 'cause your daughter says you're hanging on by your fingernails</p><p>and sleeping with your boss.</p><p>Wait, when do you talk to Violet?</p><p>We talk all the time, and we're Facebook friends.</p><p>I don't want her talking to you.</p><p>Well, she has to talk to somebody. She's sexually active, drinking, smoking grass. Sound familiar?</p><p>You're making this about me?</p><p>No, it's okay. I have come to understand that you were the best daughter you could be. My job is to forgive you, which I do.</p><p>Oh, my God! You forgive me?</p><p>I've come a long way.</p><p>Excuse me, but if anybody needs to be forgiven, it's you, and I don't, and I never will.</p><p>There's hardly a day I can remember that I didn't come home to an empty house.</p><p>Oh, don't be so dramatic.</p><p>While other mothers were cooking dinner, you were cooking meth.</p><p>Otherwise known as "working."</p><p>I don't want you in my life. And while you're at it, stay away from my daughter!</p><p>She may need a better role model than me, but it's certainly not you.</p><p>Is everything okay?</p><p>My daughter doesn't get me.</p><p>Oh. I'm sorry.</p><p>What time do you get off work? I could use a lap to cry on.</p><p>Stop crying. It wasn't an important finger. This doesn't concern you.</p><p>Oh, good, you're still here.</p><p>Hey, hi. This is a surprise.</p><p>Yeah, I just really needed to talk to you. I am having the worst day.</p><p>Hey, you ready to go?</p><p>Yes, dear. Um, Christy, you know my, uh, wife.</p><p>Yeah, hi, Claudia. Nice to see you again.</p><p>It's "Clowdia", FYI, the ladies' room needs some attention. I don't know if that's you, Christy.</p><p>It's not, and it's "Christ-y."</p><p>Okay, dear, let's go.</p><p>Don't serve the soup.</p><p>Hey, Mom. Dad's here!</p><p>Yo, yo, baby mama.</p><p>What do you want, Baxter?</p><p>A father can't visit his son?</p><p>Not when he's six months behind on child support, but you're welcome to wave</p><p>at him through the window.</p><p>Be right back, Roscoe. Don't be afraid to hit the hookers with a bat.</p><p>I think I may have found a way to pay you your child support.</p><p>Trust me, Baxter, you can't sell that much semen.</p><p>I know. I tried.</p><p>So, here's the deal. I know a guy who can hook me up with a couple of kilos of premium Sonoma Kush. All I need is $2000, from you.</p><p>Just so I'm clear. You want to pay child support by borrowing money from</p><p>me so you can buy pot?</p><p>No. So I can sell pot.</p><p>There's no money in buying pot. I know. I tried.</p><p>What are you doing here?</p><p>studying.</p><p>You let Violet have boys over while you're gone?</p><p>No, I do not, and don't worry about her, she's not your kid.</p><p>I know, but this sets a bad example for Roscoe.</p><p>Oh, you're worried about setting a bad example? You had Roscoe pee into a sippy cup so you could pass a drug test.</p><p>And it worked.</p><p>I like bananas. They have their own carrying case.</p><p>You know I can't divorce Claudia. Her father owns the restaurant;</p><p>I'm pretty sure he'd fire me, and then what? I was an English major.</p><p>I can't believe you're sleeping with that loser.</p><p>I can't believe you're sleeping with this loser!</p><p>Hey, we were mostly studying.</p><p>Shut up, Luke.</p><p>I love him.</p><p>Please, I used to love him!</p><p>She did.</p><p>Mom, Luke and I have been together for like a year. You only started noticing</p><p>when you stopped drinking.</p><p>You're right. I haven't been a very good mother, and I'm sorry, but...</p><p>But what? You want me to forgive you?</p><p>Oh, God, would you? That'd be awesome!</p><p>Why should I forgive you when you can't even forgive your own mother?</p><p>That's different.</p><p>How?</p><p>Okay. Hello, Mom, it's Christy. Yeah, yeah, today was a blast.</p><p>Listen, I just want you to know that I forgive you for everything you did when I was growing up.</p><p>I get, now, that you did the best you could, just like I'm doing.</p><p>And I hope that you and I can wipe the slate clean and start over.</p><p>No, I did not take a Xanax from your purse!</p><p>Listen, I gotta go. Yeah, talk soon.</p><p>There. I've forgiven my mother. Are we good?</p><p>It's not that easy.</p><p>Oh, come on! Like me!</p><p>Hey, Dad! If you hit the hookers enough times, they give you your money back!</p><p>Smart kid. That's my semen at work.</p><p>You still living in that red van? Looks like your house is being towed.</p><p>Oh, no, my cleaning lady's in there.</p><p>What a day, huh?</p><p>Oh, hi, Mom.</p><p>Hello, sweetie.</p><p>What are you doing here?</p><p>I just thought I'd help out while you were at work. You know, clean slate.</p><p>You didn't have to do that.</p><p>Yeah, she did. Bonnie made Roscoe and me hot dinner.</p><p>Yeah, but I...</p><p>It was hot, Mom! Like on TV. Night, Bonnie.</p><p>She calls you Bonnie?</p><p>We're like sisters. You hungry?</p><p>No, thanks. I ate at the restaurant.</p><p>How about some tea?</p><p>I'm so glad you and I have a chance to start over.</p><p>Forgive me, but I'm not quite there yet.</p><p>Of course I forgive you.</p><p>You know, I apologized for being a crappy daughter. So, anything you wanna say to me...</p><p>I love you with all my heart.</p><p>And?</p><p>And... from now on, I'm going to be the kind of mother you deserve. This is the start of a new chapter.</p><p>Oh, it's my date!</p><p>New chapter, same book.</p><p>Ready to go?</p><p>Let me just get my bag.</p><p>You remember our waiter Greg?</p><p>Hi, new dad!</p><p>Please stop. He's way to young for me.</p><p>And he's married.</p><p>Married? What a whore.</p><p>Oh, I almost forgot. Your daughter think she might be pregnant. Call me, if you need me.</p>
