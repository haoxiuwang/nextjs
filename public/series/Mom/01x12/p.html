<p>I'm thinking about going vegan.</p><p>Really? Why? Diet, health, compassion for animals?</p><p>I am not happy with how my urine smells.</p><p>Then stop smelling it! Oh! Don't look!</p><p>Don't smell, don't look... you're bossy today! Isn't that the chef from your restaurant? Yeah. He's kind of cute.</p><p>No! He's not! Everyone at work is terrified of him.</p><p>How scary can he be? He's carrying a purse.</p><p>Hey! Hello there.</p><p>Damn! Hi! Chef Rudy, good to see you.</p><p>Good to see you, too... I wanna say... Meredith?</p><p>Christy.</p><p>Right. And your mother Bonnie.</p><p>I work with you every day, and her you remember?</p><p>Does a thirsty man forget a tall glass of water? May I join you?</p><p>Sure.</p><p>So, my daughter tells me everyone at work is frightened of you.</p><p>Ooh, that's very sweet. Thank you. So, what kind of naughtiness is the mother-daughter team up to today?</p><p>Don't go there.</p><p>Mmm, too late. Mental snapshot. Click.</p><p>We've just come back from the drugstore, where we bought some, you know, girl stuff.</p><p>What are you up to today?</p><p>Oh, just blowing the dust off my spyder.</p><p>Beg pardon?</p><p>I have a vintage Porsche Spyder. She's high-strung, impulsive, and if I don't ride her hard at least once a day, she misbehaves.</p><p>I'm the same way.</p><p>Aw, all out of film. Yeah. I will bid you adieu.</p><p>A la prochaine.</p><p>Yeah, I just know "adieu."</p><p>Tell me you haven't tapped that.</p><p>Of course not.</p><p>Good.</p><p>Can I ask you a little friendly advice vis-Ã-vis my personal affairs?</p><p>Oh. Yeah. Sure.</p><p>Great. What are my chances of bedding your mother?</p><p>What? I felt there was chemistry between us. But I feel that with a lot of women, often with disastrous results.</p><p>Fun fact: Pepper spray tastes nothing like pepper.</p><p>All right, look... [sighs] I don't want to get involved here, but... I will tell you she was quite taken with you.</p><p>Oh, I knew it. When I walked out of that coffee shop, my testicles were on fire.</p><p>You might want to get those looked at.</p><p>That's what I'm trying to do. Be a dear, get her on the phone for me.</p><p>Okay, but I got to warn you about my mother. There's a little crazy up in them thar hills.</p><p>Well, you know what they say, "nothing soils the sheets like crazy."</p><p>How are you allowed to touch food?</p><p>Hi, Mom, it's me. I'm probably going to regret this, but... He's right here.</p><p>Hey, you. Been ridden hard yet, today?</p><p>Aah, clickety-click, click, click.</p><p>Is Grandma having dinner with us?</p><p>No, she's got a date.</p><p>Cool. You know the guy?</p><p>I do.</p><p>So, do you think they'll hit it off?</p><p>I'm thinking murder-suicide.</p><p>It's so weird to think of your Grandma dating. My Grandma weighs 300 pounds and has one leg.</p><p>Well, doesn't mean there's not someone out there for her.</p><p>That's true. My Grandfather would sure love it if she met somebody. Oh, I'll get it.</p><p>Well, Grandma will be easy to spot at the wedding.</p><p>Well, you must be Violet.</p><p>No, I'm Luke.</p><p>Well, you're very pretty, nonetheless. Bonnie here?</p><p>Uh, she's getting ready. Come on in. Welcome.</p><p>Thank you. Well, I had you pegged for a house on wheels.</p><p>That's the dream. Can I get you something to drink?</p><p>I wouldn't mind a glass of Pinot Grigio.</p><p>I wouldn't mind a bucket of Gin. But, uh, all we've got is tap water and milk.</p><p>I'll pass. What am I smelling?</p><p>I made dinner.</p><p>No, that can't be it. Do you have pets?</p><p>It's corned beef and cabbage.</p><p>Oh, yes, poor people food. My apologies. It smells delicious.</p><p>Ready to go?</p><p>Oh, well, there's a tasty morsel. Yum, yum.</p><p>Thank you.</p><p>He's gonna eat her?</p><p>Shall we?</p><p>Did you bring the Spyder?</p><p>Freshly lubed for your pleasure.</p><p>Ooh! Bye, family.</p><p>Have fun. Are we poor people?</p><p>Of course not.</p><p>Now, eat your boiled meat.</p><p>Wow, that was quite an education, watching a master Chef shop for groceries. Well,</p><p>I think it's important to feel and smell the things we put inside us.</p><p>I got to tell you, if I'm smelling it, I'm not feeling it. So, um, what are we having?</p><p>Well, it's a tasting menu that I call "seven small explosions in your mouth."</p><p>Seven, huh? Let's see. Salty, sweet, savory, sour... help me.</p><p>Crunchy, creamy and Rudy.</p><p>Ooh. What's Rudy taste like?</p><p>Pistachios, I've been told. Mm. But the real magic happens when we start to combine flavors.</p><p>For example, take a simple cherry tomato. Squirt a little aged balsamic vinegar into its fleshy center.</p><p>"Cherry," "squirt," "fleshy." You can't help yourself, can you?</p><p>It's very hard.</p><p>Mmm! That's not sweet like a tomato or sour like vinegar.</p><p>Exactly. It's a third thing that didn't exist until one was driven deep inside the other.</p><p>And yes, I know what I just said.</p><p>Where'd you go to culinary school?</p><p>Can you keep a secret?</p><p>Of course.</p><p>A Denny's in Boston. I worked the late shift; there's a lot of time to screw around.</p><p>Where's the Boston accent?</p><p>I dropped it. Hard to charge 60 bucks for lobster chowder with capers.</p><p>Ah. Yeah. Well, where are my manners? Can I get you a glass of wine?</p><p>No, thank you. I don't drink.</p><p>Never?</p><p>Never.</p><p>Impressive. How is it that you have not kill yourself?</p><p>I'm more of a homicide girl.</p><p>Well, then, as a good host, I won't drink, either. Ah, who am I kidding? So, why do you abstain?</p><p>I'm allergic to alcohol. Every time I drink, I break out in handcuffs.</p><p>Mm. Pity. I have a rather remarkable collection of wine and handcuffs.</p><p>You know, next to great food, beautiful women and vintage cars, wine is what brings me the most happiness.</p><p>No, actually, it's women, then food... No, wine, women... ah, I left out pills.</p><p>It's pills, wine...</p><p>I get the point.</p><p>Let's see how sophisticated your palate is. Hmm? Put on this blindfold.</p><p>Well, I usually charge 50 bucks extra for that, but okay.</p><p>I knew I liked you. And... you ready?</p><p>Do it. What do you taste?</p><p>Mmm. Fig? Very good. Now, try this.</p><p>Mmm. Eel?</p><p>And here comes the pistachios.</p><p>Morning.</p><p>Walk of shame? Stride of pride. Did you consider, for even a minute, to go slow with this guy?</p><p>See a movie, shop at the flea market, text him a picture of your boobs. You know, like a lady.</p><p>I did think about it.</p><p>And?</p><p>I chose instead to do him on the floor of his kitchen.</p><p>What is wrong with you? Don't you have any self-respect?</p><p>Oh, please. Self-respect is for women who spend Saturday night alone with their showerhead set on pulse.</p><p>That's a terrible thing to say. And I happen to have a stiff neck from work.</p><p>Did it ever occur to you that what happened last night between me and Rudolph was the start of something wonderful?</p><p>Oh, wake up! It's a one-night stand between a middle-aged alcoholic and a sex addict.</p><p>How dare you call me middle-aged? And it was not a one-night stand. Rudy and I are two ingredients, which, when combined, create a third thing which never existed before.</p><p>What the hell are you talking about?</p><p>I don't know! It's a tomato thing! Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm gonna go take a shower. To clean myself.</p><p>You'll never be clean!</p><p>So, are we gonna talk about it?</p><p>Well, I was gonna be a gentleman and spare you the details, but as you wish. Your mother is sleek yet powerful, like an enormous greyhound.</p><p>Yeah, great. Not what I want to talk about.</p><p>I just want to put it out there that no matter where your relationship goes with her, you and I maintain a professional relationship here.</p><p>Okay, two things wrong with that, Meredith. First of all, you and I don't have a professional relationship.</p><p>I'm a world-class Chef, and you are a waitress. And no offense, but I would be just as happy to put my food on a tiny toy train that choo-choos into the dining room.</p><p>And secondly, I have absolutely no plans to pursue a relationship with your mommy.</p><p>What? I thought the two of you made "a third thing". With a tomato.</p><p>No, that's just my rap when I'm trying to filet some panties.</p><p>Oh. So, you're not planning on seeing her again?</p><p>Oh, god, no. Well, never say never. Can't have a Russian hooker every night.</p><p>I don't believe this.</p><p>What kind of a man are you?</p><p>Well, selfish, narcissistic, emotionally crippled by a cold and distant mother. You know, the usual.</p><p>She's gonna be devastated.</p><p>Well, then you better break it to her gently. I'm not gonna tell her.</p><p>Wow, that seems cruel. But your call.</p><p>What's going on?</p><p>That pig slept with my mother.</p><p>Welcome to the club.</p><p>Hey. Roscoe asleep?</p><p>Yup. What'd you do tonight?</p><p>What do you care?</p><p>Oh, come on. I'm sorry about this morning. Really? So, you admit that Rudy and I are capable of having a meaningful relationship?</p><p>Well... I admit that I love you.</p><p>All right, what's going on?</p><p>Rudy's done with you.</p><p>Well, why are you telling me instead of him?</p><p>Because he was emotionally crippled by his mother. And, you know... he's a giant douche.</p><p>Wow, so I completely misread him.</p><p>I'm so sorry.</p><p>No, you warned me. I'm a big girl. I should have known better. Look at me, giving myself a pedicure so that jerk could suckle on a pretty red toe.</p><p>Is that his thing?</p><p>Oh, yeah, he's got a mouth like a Chinese finger trap.</p><p>My fault, I asked. All right, I'm gonna take a quick shower.</p><p>Say hi to your "boyfriend."</p><p>I would, but after he saw you naked, we broke up. Are you gonna be all right?</p><p>Oh, yeah.</p><p>Not gonna do anything crazy?</p><p>Oh, come on, go take a shower.</p><p>It's like she doesn't know me at all.</p><p>Yes, I want a medium meat lover's pizza with cheese in the crust. Yes, and some crazy bread.</p><p>Hello, Rudolph.</p><p>Bonnie. How'd you get in my house?</p><p>Oh, please. Who sleeps with a man and doesn't steal his spare keys?</p><p>Okay. What do you want?</p><p>What I want is to hurt you. But not physically, because... you might like that. But on an emotional level, like you hurt me.</p><p>No, you are barking up the wrong tree, sister, because I stopped feeling years ago.</p><p>Really? We'll see. Hmm. "1957 Cháteau Latour." Ooh, sounds fancy.</p><p>Thank you. And for my next trick, I will attempt to juggle three bottles of... ooh, Montrachet. Oh, ooh, ooh. Aw. I'm not very good.</p><p>Okay, I lied. I didn't just get clean. Mom? Mom? Oh, damn it!</p><p>No.</p><p>And this Mouton Rothschild is for little Jimmy, who's sick in the hospital.</p><p>Please, no more. And this Cháteau Montelena is for all the wine snobs and their nutty top notes.</p><p>Enough! Stop! I can't take it anymore.</p><p>Good. Come to me.</p><p>Oh, my god, you're magnificent. Now what?</p><p>Suckle.</p><p>Hello? Oh, my god, I'm too late. Rudy</p><p>Ah, ah, oh, yeah, Bonnie, right there, wicked hard!</p><p>Who the hell is that?</p><p>Mmm. Oh, my god. This duck is so much better than corned beef.</p><p>Yeah, and the house won't smell like a thousand egg farts.</p><p>Mm. Hello. Oh, hi, Chef Rudy. Thanks for the picnic basket. Yeah, I know it's not for me. What's up? Hang on, let me see if she's here.</p><p>She's not here. Can I take a message? Oh, slow down, let me grab a pen.</p><p>Go ahead. "the dark, violent turn our love play took last night haunts me"</p><p>Wait, say again? "The wine cork will remain where it is as a sign of my commitment".</p><p>All right, I'll be sure she gets the message. Of course I won't tell anyone at the restaurant. Bye-bye.</p><p>I think someone's sweet on you.</p>
