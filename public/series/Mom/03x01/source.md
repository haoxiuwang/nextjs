好吧，拉伸一下
All right. Stretch it out.
跑步怎么样。
How was your run?
我觉得这也许是我的个人最佳成绩，两英里用时46分钟。
I think it might have been my personal best. Two miles in 46 minutes.
你真的很投入
You're really committed to this.
不错
Good for you.
是啊，你知道大家说的跑步者高潮吧？那是真的
Yeah, well, you know how they talk about that runner's high? Well, it's real.
那不算很棒，但那是真的
It's not great, but it's real.
不错，听着，我接到了一通电话，是关于你的.
Nice. So, listen, I got a call, about you.
好吧
Okay.
你知道这里在闹旱灾吧！
You do know we're having a drought.
我选择不参与，你接到了一通电话。
Yeah, I've chosen not to participate. So you got a call?
对，那让我很惊讶
Right. It was a very surprising call.
为什么你一直在拖延
Why are you dragging this out?
因为你心情很好，我会很怀念的
Because you're in a good mood and I'm gonna miss that.
谁打来的？
Who called?
是一名受雇追查你下落的私家侦探。
It was a private investigator hired to track you down.
好吧，打包行李，我们都知道这天会来的
All right, pack your bags, We knew this day would come.
不不
No. No, no, no.
他受雇于你母亲。
He was hired by your mother.
什么
What?
她想见你
She wants to meet you.
你没事吧，那声哈是表示好，还是不好，还是要杀掉信使啊
You okay? Is that a good "Huh"? A bad "Huh"? A shoot the messenger "Huh"?
这人怎么找到我的
How'd this guy find me?
这个嘛，你最近的酒驾后果接连不断啊。
Um, well, your recent DUI seems to be the gift that keeps on giving.
总之，你妈妈住在旧金山，但如果你想见她，她很乐意开车过来。
Anyway, your mom lives in San Francisco, but she'd be willing to drive here if you want to meet her.
很高兴得知她送走了孩子但是留下了车，我想让你这样做
Nice to know she gave up her kid but kept the car. Okay, here's what I want you to do.
我想让你打给这个侦探，告诉他 他找错了邦妮·普兰科特，我妈妈因为阻止恐怖分子炸掉迪斯尼乐园而牺牲了。
I want you to call this detective and tell him he's got the wrong Bonnie Plunkett. My mother died stopping terrorists from blowing up Disneyland.
什么？
What?
这是我九岁时做出的决定，我要坚持这个说法。
That's what I decided when I was nine, and I'm sticking with it.
好吧，我会给他打电话。
Okay, I'll call him.
等等
Wait! Stop.
我没动
Didn't move.
怎么回事啊？我为什么这么生气。这只是个和我共享基因的女人。也许我该和她见面。
What is going on here? Why am I getting so upset about this? This is just a woman I share DNA with. maybe I should meet her.
谁知道呢，也许我以后会需要肾脏或者骨髓。
Who knows? Maybe I'll need a kidney or bone marrow someday.
更可能是肝脏，看在老天的份上，这可是百年一遇的旱灾
Liver, more likely. For god's sakes, it's a historic drought!
不，还是不见，如果我需要器官 我就用你的
Nope, not gonna do it. If I need an organ, I'll get it from you.
我的肝脏可能没什么改善。
My liver might not be an upgrade.
那女人在我四岁时送走了我。
That woman gave me up when I was four years old.
你知道被送去寄养的。四岁小孩会怎么样吗？
You know what happens to four-year-olds who get tossed into the system?
他们不会被领养，特别是他们身高五英尺时。
They don't get adopted, especially when they're five feet tall!
又在乱跑了，我们去参加会议怎么样
Okay, we're walking again. Hey, how 'bout we go to a meeting?
你去吧，我要去跑步
You go to a meeting. I'm going for a run.
你刚跑了！
You just did that.
记得我以前是怎么吸毒的吗，现在我那样跑步。
Remember how I used to do blow? Now I run like that.
所以你一点都不想跟她见面吗？
So you're not the least bit curious to meet her?
她不是我妈妈，这女人都更像我妈，她喂养我的次数更多。
She's not my mother. This woman is more my mother. She's fed me more times.
如果你时不时说句"请"和"谢谢"就好了。
Be nice if you said "Please" and "Thank you" once in a while.
帮她说句话，她的确给了你生命
In her defense, she did give you life.
我不同意！
I disagree.
你要怎么辩啊？
How do you disagree with that?
我会以别的方式来到这世界
I would've gotten here some other way.
你不好奇她想怎么样吗？
Don't you wonder what she wants?
谁在乎啊，一开始她想要个小女孩，然后她不想要小女孩了，现在她又想要小女孩了。
Who cares what she wants? First she wanted a little girl, then she didn't want a little girl. Now she wants a little girl again?
我才不要当她的小女孩，不可能！
Well, I'm not gonna be her little girl. Not gonna happen.
她觉得自己是个小女孩吗？
She thinks she's a little girl?
邦妮，我知道你不想听，但是跟她见面可能对你有好处，也许能治愈你！
Bonnie, I know you don't want to hear this, But seeing her again might be good for you. It might be healing.
拜托，如果我治愈了，那我是谁啊？
Oh, please. Who am I if I heal?
我想见她！
I want to meet her.
你开玩笑的对吧！
You're kidding, right?
她是我外婆，我想了解我来自什么家庭。
She's my grandmother. I'd like to know where I come from.
难以置信你居然不站在我这边
I can't believe you're not on my side with this.
我没有选边站，我们没亲戚！
I'm not taking sides. We have no relatives.
去年罗斯科得画一个家谱交作业，那只有一片叶子！
Roscoe had to make a family tree for school last year. It had one leaf.
不该有四片叶子吗，因为他有姐姐
Wouldn't it have four leaves since he has a sibling and...
我在表明观点呢，温蒂！
Trying to make a point, Wendy.
你想怎么做都行，不用谢。
Do what you want. You're welcome.
我是克丽丝蒂·普兰科特。
I'm Christy Plunkett.
你好，克丽丝蒂。
Hello, Christy.
很高兴见到你。
It is so nice to meet you.
我也是，你真漂亮！
Well, it's nice to meet you, too. You are so pretty.
谢谢！
Thank you.
你闻起来像是姜饼，我一直想着你就散发这种味道。
You smell like gingerbread. That's always how I imagined you'd smell.
你想过闻我吗？
You imagined smelling me?
大部分时候都在圣诞节，我们的鼻子好像一样
Mostly at Christmas. I think we have the same nose.
好吧，这变得很奇怪了
Okay, now, this is getting weird.
等等，你不是雪莉·斯特布勒吗
Wait, aren't you Shirley Stabler?
不，那是我
No, that's me.
对不起，我还以为你是我外婆
I'm sorry. I thought you were my grandmother.
我们扯平了，我以为你是疯子呢！
Well, we're even. I thought you were nuts.
很高兴见到你
Nice to meet you.
我也是。
It's nice to meet you, too.
你闻起来有烟味，对 你就是我外婆
Ah. You smell like cigarettes. Yep, you're my grandmother.
瞧瞧你，你看起来和我想象的完全不一样
Look at you. You look nothing like I pictured.
那位女士觉得我很漂亮。
That lady thought I was pretty.
是啊，你的确漂亮，那不可能是你的天生发色，但挺好看的
Oh, you are. You're beautiful. No way that's your natural hair color. But it looks good on you.
抱歉你女儿不能来！
I'm sorry your daughter couldn't be here.
没关系，我猜也只有一半的可能性。
Oh, that's okay. I figured it was a 50/50 shot.
你居然觉得可能性有这么大，真可爱！
It's cute you thought it was that close.
我猜她恨我吧！
I'm guessing she hates me.
是啊 但是她恨好多人，她讨厌艾尔顿·约翰，谁讨厌艾尔顿·约翰啊，那人可是个热歌大师！
Yeah, but she hates so many people. She hates Elton John. I mean, who hates Elton John? The guy's a hit machine.
你是个喋喋不休的人啊！
Oh, so you're a babbler, huh?
只有在我不舒服的时候
Only when I'm uncomfortable.
不是说我现在不舒服，我是说...
Not that I'm uncomfortable now. I mean...
对，我就是喋喋不休。
Yeah. Yeah, I am a babbler.
很高兴你来了。
Well, I'm glad you came.
你看上去好像挺好的。
You look like you turned out fine.
实际上，前33年情况有些危险，我曾是个酒瘾者，脱衣舞女，也算是吸毒者。
Actually, the first 33 years were kind of touch and go. I was an alcoholic and a stripper and a bit of a drug addict.
克丽丝蒂
Oh, Christy.
我扭转了！
I turned it around.
去找你自家外孙女去。
Hey, go find your own granddaughter.
现在我有了一份不错的工作，回去上学了，有两个很棒的孩子。
Now I have a great job, I've gone back to school, I have two terrific kids.
你有照片吗？
You got any pictures?
好吧，这是罗斯科，他十岁了。那是我，很担心的一块皮疹，但它消掉了，这是维奥莉特。
Okay. This is Roscoe. He's ten. This was a rash I was concerned about, but it's cleared up. This is Violet.
她真是个美女。
Oh, she's a beauty.
还有，这是你女儿
And there's your daughter.
这对眼睛，同样的美丽的眼睛，她的身高是不是和大脚相符了
Those eyes. The same beautiful eyes. Did she finally grow into those big feet of hers?
差不多吧。
Almost.
那么，你俩是怎么回事啊
So what happened with the whole thing with you?
直奔主题啊！
Oh. Right to the chase, huh?
没事，你不必说。
It's okay, you don't have to.
不不不，这是我们来的原因。
No. No, no, no. That's why we're here.
我满20岁后，邦妮的父亲死于摩托车事故。
Well, right after I turned 20, Bonnie's father got killed in a motorcycle accident.
我没有家人帮我，所以我得工作，大部分是打扫房屋。
And I didn't have no family to help me out, so I had to get work, mostly cleaning houses.
我请不起保姆，所以我经常因为带上了邦妮而被炒。
Um, I couldn't afford a babysitter, so I got fired a lot for bringing Bonnie with me.
那很糟糕，有时候我都没钱给她买吃的。
It was bad. There were some days when I could barely afford to feed her.
我曾经输光了房租，最后跟我的孩子们住在汽车旅馆里。
I once gambled away our rent money and ended up with my kids in a motel.
你想跟我比惨吗？
You trying to top my story?
不是啦，对不起，继续吧！
No, no. I'm sorry. Go on.
总之，在我们住到车里的那天，我认为她过上像样生活的唯一机会，就是我把她送去寄养，所以，我就送了
Well, anyway, the day that I moved us into my car, I figured the only shot she had at a decent life was if I put her in foster care. So that's what I did.
那真是令人心碎！
That's heartbreaking.
我真高兴，比起我对她，她对你来说是个更好的妈妈。
I'm glad she could be a better mother to you than I was to her.
这么说吧，你俩还胜负未定。
Let's just say it's a horse race.
不如你想的那么简单，她没有钱，养不起你，送你去领养让她心碎。
Not as simple as you think. She had no money, she couldn't feed you. Giving you up broke her heart.
故事不错，我要坚持迪斯尼乐园恐怖分子的说法！
Nice story. I'm sticking with the Disneyland terrorists.
你得去见她，这可能是你最后的机会了。
You need to see her. It might be your last chance.
你说些什么呢？
What are you talking about?
她来找你的原因是她快死了。
The reason she reached out to you is she's dying.
她还能活多久？
How long does she have?
几个月？
Couple months.
我要去跑步！
I'm going for a run.
真的吗，这是你的新事物吗，每次你处理不好自己的感情，就去跑步吗？
Really? Is that the new thing with you? Every time you can't deal with your feelings, you go jogging?
你说得对，你泡点茶吧，我们坐下来谈谈。
You're right. Why don't you make some tea? We'll sit down and talk about it.
谢谢，你现在表现得像是成年人了。
Thank you. Now you're acting like an adult.
我还是要泡茶！
I'm still making tea.
就五分钟，然后我们就走。
Five minutes, and then we're out of here.
我真的为你骄傲。
I'm really proud of you.
如果我快死了，我知道你会想来见我的。
Hey, if I were dying, I know you'd want to see me.
我绝不会错过的。
Wouldn't miss it for the world.
你好啊，克丽丝蒂。
Hello, Christy.
哎哟，终于决定从石头下爬出来了啊
Well, well, well. Mom. Finally decided to crawl out from under your rock, huh?
不，是你带我来的，我要这样做
No, you brought me here, I'm doing this.
你真有种，想要我的原谅。
You're a real piece of work, wanting my forgiveness.
妈，拜托！
Mom, please...
我不知道你因为什么病要死了，但我希望这过程缓慢痛苦。
I don't know what you're dying of, but I hope it's slow and painful.
她不是你妈。
She's not your mother.
祝你今天愉快。
You have a super day.
克丽丝蒂。
Christy.
真好，这是你妈妈
Oh, good. This is your mother.
你好 邦妮
Hello, Bonnie.
也许我们坐下来会更舒服。我先坐。
Probably be more comfortable if we sat down. I'll go first.
我说会更舒服，是我错了
Well, I was wrong about it being more comfortable.
多谢你愿意见我。
Thank you so much for being willing to see me.
我来这里只是因为你快死了，你得了什么病？
I'm only here 'cause you're about to die. What do you got anyway?
心脏病。
Uh, it's my heart.
是我们得担心的遗传病吗？
Something hereditary we need to worry about?
不，只是多年艰苦的生活导致的。
No, just years of hard living finally caught up with me.
也许我们该担心一点。
Maybe we should worry a little.
亲爱的，我知道我见到你时打算跟你说什么，但现在我不知道从何说起了。
Honey, I knew what I was gonna say to you when I saw you, but now I don't know where to start.
跟她说说你对我说的话啊。
Just tell her what you told me.
邦妮，送你去领养是我这辈子做过的最艰难的事和犯下的最糟糕的错。
Bonnie, giving you up was the hardest thing and the worst mistake I ever made in my whole life.
但是我想告诉你，我每天都在想你。
But I want you to know that I thought of you every single day.
真棒，你为什么不回来，你说你会回来的。
Yeah, terrific. Why didn't you come back? You said you were gonna come back.
我想的，我试过了！
Well, I wanted to. I tried.
你让我在寄养家庭之间被踢来踢去。
You left me bouncing around foster homes.
我在努力赚钱，摆脱困境。
I was trying to make money, trying to get on my feet.
好吧，所以呢？
Yeah, so?
事情变得很复杂。
It got complicated.
那是什么意思？
What the hell does that mean?
天啊。我曾是塔霍的酒吧服务员，我遇见了一个男人，跟他同居了。
Oh, god. I was a cocktail waitress in Tahoe. And I met this guy, and I moved in with him.
然后呢？
And?
然后
And...
告诉我
Tell me.
他说他不想要孩子。
He said he didn't want any kids around.
抱歉，我不知道这部分。
I'm sorry. I didn't know this part.
所以你选择了你的幸福，而不是我的。
So you picked your happiness over mine.
我当时很年轻，很害怕，我能怎么做呢？我搞砸了！
I was young, I was scared. What can I say? I screwed up.
不 我对她才是搞砸了，你对我做的事是无可原谅的
No, I screwed up with her. What you did to me is unforgivable.
我知道
I know.
往好的方面看，她快死了！
On the bright side, she's dying.
你走了很久！
You were gone a long time.
我决定跑步 直到我不再生气，我大概跑了18英里，吐了，不得不坐公交回来
I decided to run until I wasn't mad anymore. I went, like, 18 miles, puked and had to take the bus back.
听着，玛乔丽想跟你谈谈，所以...
Listen, Marjorie really wanted to talk to you, so...
别说了，我已经知道她要说什么了，我没必要听她用她的萎缩小苹果头说出来。
Stop. I already know what she's gonna say. I don't need to hear it come out of her shrunken little apple head.
你好啊，邦妮。
Hello, Bonnie.
你不知道怎么提醒我吗？
Do you not know how to give a heads up?
坐下，听苹果头说话。
Sit down and listen to the apple head.
让我猜猜，你想要我原谅我母亲邀请她重回我的生活。
Let me guess, you want me to forgive my mother and invite her back into my life.
不，我只是...
No, I just...
那女人抛弃了我，从那天开始的每一天，我都觉得我不招人喜欢
That woman threw me away, and I've spent every day since then thinking I was unlovable.
有时候你的确如此。话虽如此，但你可能还有别的选择，而不是这辈子都恨你母亲。
And sometimes you are. That being said, there might be an alternative to hating your mother for the rest of your life.
你引起了我的注意。
You got my attention.
进来吧！
Come on in.
谢谢你见我！
Thanks for seeing me.
你打电话来时我好高兴，你想喝咖啡吗？
Oh, I was so happy when you called. You want some coffee?
好啊。
Sure.
黑咖啡可以吗？
Black okay?
可以，你在这里住了多久？
That's fine. So how long have you lived here?
大概20年！
About 20 years.
这里挺不错的。
It's nice.
才不是。
No, it ain't.
的确不是。
No, it ain't.
我想你要问我很多问题啊！
I guess you got a lot of questions for me huh?
是啊，我对我父亲一无所知，甚至连他的名字都不知道》
Well, yeah. I don't know anything about my father. I don't even know his name.
他叫亨利，他是个好人，很有幽默感，他高大英俊，车技不好，真的！
It was Henry. Uh, just a terrific guy. Had a great sense of humor. He was handsome, tall. Couldn't ride a motorcycle to save his life. Literally.
他不是保罗·纽曼，另一个幻想破灭了！
So he wasn't Paul Newman. And another fantasy dies.
我觉得你也许想拥有他的照片。
I thought you might like to have a picture of him.
他抱的是我吗》
Is that me he's holding?
是的。
Yeah.
这时候我大概两岁吗？
What, was I about two years old here?
不，大概六个月。
No, about six months.
你怎么回事，吸毒，酗酒。
So what was your deal? Drugs? Booze?
抱歉？
Sorry?
我只是觉得如果我们是母女，肯定两者必占其一，或者两者都是。
Well, I just assumed if we're related, it must be one or the other or both.
不
Oh, no.
我抽过一点大麻，但那一直让我很多疑，我从来都不喜欢喝酒。
Well, I smoked a little pot, but it just always made me paranoid. And I never developed a taste for alcohol.
还有不喜欢的吗？
It has a taste?
克丽丝蒂告诉我你有麻烦，但你好像在处理。
Uh, Christy told me that you had a problem. But you seem to be dealing with it.
我挺好的。
I'm doing great.
是的。
Yes, you are.
总之，我来这里是想告诉你，我原谅你了。
Anyway, I came here to, uh, tell you that, um, I forgive you.
谢谢！
Mm, thank you.
不 别谢我，我这样做不是为了你，而是为了我。
No, don't thank me. I'm not doing it for you. I'm doing it for me.
你什么意思？
What do you mean?
雪莉，我的一个好朋友告诉我，如果我原谅你，我的心里可能就不会再愤怒。
Shirley, a good friend of mine told me, if I could forgive you, I could finally be free of all the anger in my heart.
我真的需要解脱，因为如果不这样，我就会再次酗酒，或者跑到死。
And I really need to be free of it. Because if I'm not, I'm gonna drink again. Or jog myself to death.
那挺好的，我们可以从头来过。
That's good. Then we... we can start over.
我想不行。
No, I don't think so.
我原谅你不代表，我想让你出现在我的生活之中，那也是我朋友告诉我的。
I Just because I forgive you doesn't mean I want you in my life. That's something my friend told me, too.
这朋友是谁。
Who's this friend?
说实话，她不像是朋友，更像是我未曾拥有过的母亲，但我绝对不会告诉她那话的。
Well, to be honest, she's not so much a friend as the mother I never had. But I'll be damned if I'll tell her that.
好吧，我得走了！
Okay, uh, I got to go.
就走吗，我会再次见到你吗？
Already? Am I... am I gonna see you again?
我不知道，也许吧，我需要一些时间。
I don't know. Maybe. I need some time.
我能抱抱你吗？
Can I at least give you a hug?
抱歉，不行，现在还不行。
I'm sorry, I don't think so. Not... not yet.
谢谢你给我照片
Thank you for the picture.
你在你爸家玩得开心吗？
Did you have a nice time at your dad's?
挺好的，听着，我有点困惑，你知道她的事有多久了？
Yeah, it was great. So, listen. I'm a little confused. How long have you known about her?
我们是几天前跟她见面的。
Well, we met her a couple days ago.
我该怎么称呼她，曾外婆吗？
So what do I call her? Great-grandma?
我觉得她会很喜欢这称呼的。
I think she'd really like that.
我做了饼干。
I made cookies.
谁说你不能选择家人啊！
Who says you can't pick your family?
