<p>"Remove the test stick from the foil wrapper and take off the over-cap."</p><p>"Holding the test by the thumb grip, place the absorbent tip in urine stream." </p><p>You got to tinkle on it. </p><p>It's not the first time I've done a pregnancy test, mom. </p><p>Really? Then why'd you make me read all those instructions? Not important. Let it rip. </p><p>Can I have some privacy, please?</p><p>Sure. Violet, I just want you to know that if it turns out you are pregnant, I will support you no matter what you decide to do. </p><p>Thank you. What do you think you're gonna do? </p><p>What? </p><p>You know, which way you leanin'? </p><p>I don't know. Get out. </p><p>Okay, sorry. You know, when I found out I was pregnant with you, a home pregnancy test took about 20 minutes. </p><p>Uh-huh. </p><p>Now it's two minutes. That's progress. Yay, science. </p><p>I guess. </p><p>I mean, it's good news for you because the nervous waiting time is less. </p><p>Mom, I can't do this if you're talking to me. </p><p>All right, sure. </p><p>Pee-shy runs in the family. </p><p>Mom! </p><p>Sorry. Oh, good girl! </p><p>Be quiet! </p><p>Hello? </p><p>Hi. </p><p>What's the word? </p><p>She's doing the test now. We'll know in a couple minutes. </p><p>Wow. Gulp. </p><p>Yeah. </p><p>When I was pregnant with you, those home kits took, like, two hours.</p><p>Really? </p><p>It was a long wait in a gas station bathroom. </p><p>Bonnie, is that you? </p><p>Yeah, honey. </p><p>Can you come in? </p><p>Of course. </p><p>Why does your grandmother get to go in and I don't? </p><p>Because she won't lecture me. </p><p>I don't lecture. I share my experiences in the hope that you'll have a better life than I had, and frankly, I think you could be a little more grateful. Oh, screw it, I'm coming in. </p><p>What's it say? </p><p>Nothing yet. </p><p>Oh, God, oh, God. </p><p>I know, it's so exciting. </p><p>I'm glad you're excited. I'm scared to death. </p><p>Hey, don't you worry. I'm gonna be here for you whenever you need me, 24-7. </p><p>Thanks, Bonnie. </p><p>I'm gonna be here for you, too. </p><p>That's your job, mom. </p><p>Ooh. Here we go, showtime. </p><p>Okay. Wow. You doing all right? </p><p>I don't know. Excuse me. </p><p>I can't believe this. </p><p>Hey, you have to take some of the responsibility for this pregnancy. </p><p>Are you kidding? We had the talk. I told her about abstinence, cоndоm, everything. </p><p>Did you mention oral sеx as a work-around? </p><p>Oh, my God, it is my fault. </p><p>When are you gonna stop with the bangs? </p><p>What? I just understood it when you had a forehead full of pimples, but now you're just hiding a pretty face. </p><p>This is the look now. The first lady wears her hair like this. </p><p>Well, I don't think it works on her, either. </p><p>Noted. What are we gonna do about Violet? </p><p>I love her hair. </p><p>No, the pregnancy. I don't want her to wind up like us. </p><p>What's the matter with us? </p><p>The fact that you don't know speaks volumes. </p><p>She has options. I know. Did I ever tell you how close I came to giving you up for adoption? </p><p>What? </p><p>Lovely Jewish couple from San Francisco, the Lowensteins. She played cello for the philharmonic, he was a cardiologist. </p><p>You never told me this. </p><p>Oh, yeah. They offered me $25,000 for you. </p><p>Why didn't you take it? They sound fantastic. </p><p>Well, they were, but you were my baby girl. I loved you. </p><p>If you really loved me, you would've sold me to the Lowensteins. </p><p>Maybe if they'd gone to 30. </p><p>I've made a decision. I'm gonna be a mom. </p><p>Eek. </p><p>Okay. Well, then, congratulations. We're having a baby. </p><p>I'm so happy for you, Violet.</p><p>Thanks. </p><p>And the great thing about having a baby so young is after a few years, you can tell people the kid's your sibling. Right, sis? </p><p>That's not as cute as you think it is. </p><p>Uh, couple of questions. What about high school? </p><p>What about it? The baby won't be born till after I graduate, so it shouldn't be a problem. </p><p>Eek. </p><p>I guess the next thing to do is call Luke. </p><p>You think he's the father? </p><p>I know he's the father. </p><p>How about that? Old-school. </p><p>Grandma! </p><p>Ah, ah, ah. Aunt Bonnie. </p><p>There's my boy. Why do you have glitter on your shirt? </p><p>Dad took me to his girlfriend's apartment. I learned how to swing on a pole. </p><p>He's a natural. </p><p>I thought your girlfriend worked at Bed, Bath and Beyond. </p><p>Doesn't mean she can't dream. </p><p>Okay. Go wash the sad lady off your hands. </p><p>Thanks for taking him this afternoon. </p><p>Hey, I'm his dad. If I can't spend two hours a week with him, who can? </p><p>It's not always great knowing who the father is. </p><p>Why is my son pregnant? </p><p>Well, that's a window into a dark room. </p><p>Sorry. </p><p>You okay? </p><p>I'm fine. </p><p>Come on. </p><p>Okay. Well, I just found out my teenage daughter is pregnant. </p><p>Really? Wow. She's not a cheerleader with an overbite, is she? </p><p>No. Why? </p><p>No reason. </p><p>Okay. Nice talking to you, Chef Rudy. </p><p>Stay strong, waitress whose name I do not know. Thank God. </p><p>Here we are. Oh. How is the Chardonnay? </p><p>It is delicious. Good choice. </p><p>Oh, yeah, back in the day, I could get lost in a bottle of this stuff. </p><p>One time, I woke up in a Best Western hotel with two of the roadies from Counting Crows. But I'm sure that won't happen to you. </p><p>Hey. I miss you. </p><p>Oh, thanks. </p><p>You miss me? </p><p>Yeah, sure, I guess. </p><p>That's not very encouraging. </p><p>I'm sorry. I got a lot on my mind. </p><p>Well, I'm a good listener. A penny for your thoughts? </p><p>Okay, fine. How's this? I'm working my ass off so I can take care of my children. </p><p>I just found out I'm gonna be a freaking grandma, and the man that I'm sleeping with only has time for me when his wife is out of town.</p><p>and I desperately want to run away from it all with a bottle of this but I can't because my name is Christy and I'm an alcoholic. </p><p>In this moment, my life is perfect. I breathe in love. I breathe out fear. </p><p>Ah, I Didn't see you there, Luke. </p><p>I could tell. </p><p>How's it going? </p><p>Pretty good. Um, Violet texted me that we needed to talk, so I came right over after work, and I brought sliders. They give us the ones that smell iffy. </p><p>Double yum. </p><p>Yeah, it's a pretty sweet perk. So how was your day? </p><p>Not great. </p><p>Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. Mine's been awesome. I got promoted to shift manager and found five dollars in the men's room. It wasn't even that wet. </p><p>You're on fire. </p><p>Right? Come on in. Let's see what the rest of your life looks like. </p><p>Hey, Vi. </p><p>Hi, Luke. </p><p>Um, I'd kiss you, but I don't want your mom to get the wrong idea about me. </p><p>Has that ship sailed. </p><p>So, what's going on? </p><p>Well, I got some kind of big news. </p><p>Cool. What? </p><p>Okay, um... </p><p>Violet, wait. </p><p>Luke, can you give us a minute? </p><p>Sure. I'll nuke these bad boys so we don't get the squirts. </p><p>Isn't he amazing? </p><p>Yeah. I just think it's important that you understand he might not have the maturity to deal with this situation. </p><p>I'm just gonna hit the popcorn button and see what happens. </p><p>Luke loves me. I love him. We're gonna make this work. </p><p>Honey, I just don't want you to get hurt. Young guys spook real easy, and you can't count on them sticking around. </p><p>Whoa. I think I know what you wanted to tell me. </p><p>You do? </p><p>Yeah. You're having a baby. </p><p>So close. Violet? </p><p>Luke, I'm having a baby. </p><p>Wait. So you're both pregnant? </p><p>No, just me. </p><p>Oh. Well, that's so cool! There's still time for you. Not much, but keep at it. </p><p>Thank you. </p><p>So you're not gonna get scared and run off? </p><p>Why would I run off? </p><p>I love you, and I'm gonna love your baby. </p><p>Um, it's our baby. </p><p>What? </p><p>Even better! </p><p>That's why I get so frustrated with the people at work. </p><p>I slept with that guy. </p><p>Really? </p><p>He cries when he finishes. </p><p>What do you mean? Like a happy cry? </p><p>No. More like a...  And that tiny dude over there in the red shirt? </p><p>Did you sleep with him, too? </p><p>Well, I wasn't going to at first because of our height disparity, and then I decided to do it anyway as, like, a good deed. </p><p>That's how you get into heaven. Letting a little guy go up on you. </p><p>I wish. All he wanted to do was spank me. </p><p>Well, no good deed goes unpunished. </p><p>I had to sit on my hip for a week. </p><p>So how many men at this meeting have you slept with? </p><p>Oh, please, this is a sacred space dedicated to recovery and healing. Six. </p><p>Anyone else like to share? </p><p>Oh, me. </p><p>Haven't you shared enough? </p><p>Hi. I'm Bonnie, and I'm an alcoholic. </p><p>I just want to start by saying how grateful I am to this program. Not only am I happily sober, but so is my daughter. </p><p>And let me tell you, she was a hot mess. Come on. Stand up, honey. Let everybody see how pretty you are now. </p><p>Imagine her without the bangs. P.S. She's single, fellas. Not for you, Spanky. Anyhow, it's just a real gift to have her back in my life. </p><p>And, uh, I know I wasn't the world's greatest mom when she was growing up, what with all my drinking and drսg and dealing and managing an international escort service with ties to the Russian mob</p><p>but you know, it's hard to have a career and be a mom. Am I right, ladies? </p><p>I remember this. one time, she was five years old. Maybe she was 11. The point is she was little. </p><p>And I pulled her out of school, moved us up to Manitoba where I opened up a daycare center that was a front for an ecstasy distribution hub. </p><p>It worked out really well until one mountie had to be a freaking hero. </p><p>You are so lucky to have her for a mother. </p><p>You don't have to tell me. </p><p>She's a... </p><p>I mean it! You don't have to tell me. </p><p>Don't get me wrong. I love Canada. Hey, remember Canadian beer? Wasn't that great? </p><p>Hello? Violet? </p><p>Did you finish your homework? Did you brush your teeth? </p><p>I think so. Mmm, what do you mean, you "think so"? </p><p>My brain is full. I'm worried about the Middle East. </p><p>All right, you'll brush twice as long in the morning. Get in there. Middle East. </p><p>Want to know a secret? </p><p>Sure. </p><p>You're gonna be an Uncle. </p><p>Cool. </p><p>Do you know what that means? </p><p>Yeah. I'm your boyfriend and I get to sleep over. </p><p>No, that's a different kind of Uncle. It means that I'm gonna have a baby. </p><p>Really? A human baby? </p><p>I hope so. But I'm gonna need your help. </p><p>With what? </p><p>Taking care of the baby. </p><p>Oh, sure. I'll take good care of it like you take good care of me. </p><p>You're gonna be a great Uncle. </p><p>I have a secret, too. </p><p>What's that? </p><p>I haven't brushed my teeth in three days. </p><p>You little stinker! </p><p>Mom? </p><p>What's wrong? </p><p>You're a better mother than I am. </p><p>I know. </p><p>You're gonna love my gynecologist. He's got very small hands. Like an Asian raccoon. </p><p>Mom, please! </p><p>I'm gonna be an Uncle. Unless it's a girl. Then I'll be an aunt. </p><p>I respect your open-mindedness. </p><p>Gotta give this kid Luke points for showing up. </p><p>He claims he loves her. </p><p>Well, we'll see. I had three significant relationships end while I was pregnant with you, so... </p><p>Christy? </p><p>Carla? Hi. </p><p>I haven't seen you since high school. </p><p>Yeah, hi! Wow! Look at you. </p><p>Yeah, finally getting around to starting a family. And you? </p><p>I, uh... I'm fighting a nasty yeast infection. </p><p>And with the support of her entire family, she will win this battle. </p><p>Am I right? </p><p>Oh, come on. </p><p>And there is your baby. </p><p>Wow. Luke, look what we made. </p><p>Unreal. I can't wait for it to grow feet so I can make moccasins for it. </p><p>Mom, come here. I'm gonna need your help. </p><p>I'll be here. </p><p>Mom? I'm gonna need your help. </p><p>I'm not going anywhere. </p><p>"Clitoris." </p><p>Well, someone's in a good mood. </p><p>You know, I am. I am just... loving my life right now. </p><p>Mmm. Cocaine? </p><p>Family. </p><p>Family. That stuff will kill you.</p>
