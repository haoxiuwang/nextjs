"Remove the test stick from the foil wrapper and take off the over-cap."
"Holding the test by the thumb grip, place the absorbent tip in urine stream."
You got to tinkle on it.
It's not the first time I've done a pregnancy test, mom.
Really? Then why'd you make me read all those instructions? Not important. Let it rip.
Can I have some privacy, please?
Sure. Violet, I just want you to know that if it turns out you are pregnant, I will support you no matter what you decide to do.
Thank you. What do you think you're gonna do?
What?
You know, which way you leanin'?
I don't know. Get out.
Okay, sorry. You know, when I found out I was pregnant with you, a home pregnancy test took about 20 minutes.
Uh-huh.
Now it's two minutes. That's progress. Yay, science.
I guess.
I mean, it's good news for you because the nervous waiting time is less.
Mom, I can't do this if you're talking to me.
All right, sure.
Pee-shy runs in the family.
Mom!
Sorry. Oh, good girl!
Be quiet!
Hello?
Hi.
What's the word?
She's doing the test now. We'll know in a couple minutes.
Wow. Gulp.
Yeah.
When I was pregnant with you, those home kits took, like, two hours.
Really?
It was a long wait in a gas station bathroom.
Bonnie, is that you?
Yeah, honey.
Can you come in?
Of course.
Why does your grandmother get to go in and I don't?
Because she won't lecture me.
I don't lecture. I share my experiences in the hope that you'll have a better life than I had, and frankly, I think you could be a little more grateful. Oh, screw it, I'm coming in.
What's it say?
Nothing yet.
Oh, God, oh, God.
I know, it's so exciting.
I'm glad you're excited. I'm scared to death.
Hey, don't you worry. I'm gonna be here for you whenever you need me, 24-7.
Thanks, Bonnie.
I'm gonna be here for you, too.
That's your job, mom.
Ooh. Here we go, showtime.
Okay. Wow. You doing all right?
I don't know. Excuse me.
I can't believe this.
Hey, you have to take some of the responsibility for this pregnancy.
Are you kidding? We had the talk. I told her about abstinence, cоndоm, everything.
Did you mention oral sеx as a work-around?
Oh, my God, it is my fault.
When are you gonna stop with the bangs?
What? I just understood it when you had a forehead full of pimples, but now you're just hiding a pretty face.
This is the look now. The first lady wears her hair like this.
Well, I don't think it works on her, either.
Noted. What are we gonna do about Violet?
I love her hair.
No, the pregnancy. I don't want her to wind up like us.
What's the matter with us?
The fact that you don't know speaks volumes.
She has options. I know. Did I ever tell you how close I came to giving you up for adoption?
What?
Lovely Jewish couple from San Francisco, the Lowensteins. She played cello for the philharmonic, he was a cardiologist.
You never told me this.
Oh, yeah. They offered me $25,000 for you.
Why didn't you take it? They sound fantastic.
Well, they were, but you were my baby girl. I loved you.
If you really loved me, you would've sold me to the Lowensteins.
Maybe if they'd gone to 30.
I've made a decision. I'm gonna be a mom.
Eek.
Okay. Well, then, congratulations. We're having a baby.
I'm so happy for you, Violet.
