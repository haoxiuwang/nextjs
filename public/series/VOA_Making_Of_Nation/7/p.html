<p>This is Rich Kleinfeldt.</p><p>And this is Sarah Long with THE MAKING OF A NATION,</p><p>a VOA Special English program about the history of the United States.</p><p>Today, we finish the story about the first thirteen American colonies.</p><p>We tell about how the southern colonies developed.</p><p>The most northern of the southern colonies was Maryland.</p><p>The king of England, Charles the First,</p><p>gave the land between Virginia and Pennsylvania to George Calvert in 1632.</p><p>George Calvert was also called Lord Baltimore.</p><p>He was a Roman Catholic.</p><p>George Calvert wanted to start a colony because of religious problems in England.</p><p>Catholics could not openly observe their religion.</p><p>They also had to pay money to the government because they did not belong to the Anglican Church,</p><p>which was the Church of England.</p><p>George Calvert never saw the colony that was called Maryland.</p><p>He died soon after he received the documents.</p><p>His son Cecil Calvert became the next Lord Baltimore,</p><p>and received all the land.</p><p>He had the power to collect taxes,</p><p>fight wars, make laws and create courts in Maryland.</p><p>Cecil Calvert named his brother Leonard as the colony's first governor.</p><p>Cecil Calvert believed that English Catholics could live in peace in Maryland with people who believed in Protestant religions.</p><p>So he urged Catholics to leave England.</p><p>To get more settlers,</p><p>he permitted them to own their farms and gave them some power in local politics.</p><p>Some Catholics did go to Maryland,</p><p>but not as many as expected.</p><p>Protestants were in the majority.</p><p>In 1649, Lord Baltimore accepted a Toleration Act passed by the local government.</p><p>It guaranteed freedom of religion,</p><p>but only for Christians.</p><p>King Charles the Second of England gave away more land in America in 1663.</p><p>This time, he gave to eight English lords the land known as Carolina.</p><p>It extended south from Virginia into an area known as Florida.</p><p>Spain controlled Florida.</p><p>Spain also claimed the southern part of Carolina.</p><p>Spanish, French and English settlers had tried to live in that area earlier.</p><p>But they were not successful.</p><p>But the eight new owners promised forty hectares of land to anyone who would go to Carolina to live.</p><p>They also promised religious freedom.</p><p>The first successful Carolina settlers left England in 1670.</p><p>They built a town in an area where two rivers met.</p><p>They called it Charles Town, for King Charles.</p><p>Spanish ships attacked the port city many times,</p><p>but the settlers kept them away.</p><p>The settlers planted all kinds of crops to see what would grow best.</p><p>They found rice was just right for the hot,</p><p>wet land.</p><p>Their pigs and cattle did so well that settlers in Carolina started selling meat to the West Indies.</p><p>Many of Charles Town's settlers came from Barbados,</p><p>a port used in the West Indies slave trade.</p><p>The settlers began buying black slaves to help grow the rice.</p><p>By 1708, more blacks than whites lived in southern Carolina.</p><p>The work of slaves made possible a successful economy.</p><p>Northern Carolina grew much more slowly than the southern part of the colony.</p><p>Many settlers to this area were from nearby Virginia.</p><p>People who did not agree with the Anglican Church were not welcome in Virginia.</p><p>Some of them moved south to the northern part of Carolina.</p><p>History experts say that the area that became North Carolina may have been the most democratic of all the colonies.</p><p>The people generally did not get involved in each otherâ€™s lives.</p><p>They permitted each other to live in peace.</p><p>They faced danger together from pirates who made the North Carolina coast their headquarters.</p><p>Experts say the people in northern Carolina were independent thinkers.</p><p>In 1677, some of them rebelled against England.</p><p>They did not like England's Navigation Acts.</p><p>These laws forced people in Carolina to pay taxes to England on goods sold to other colonies.</p><p>Some northern Carolina settlers refused to pay this tax.</p><p>They even set up their own government and tried to break free of England.</p><p>But the English soldiers in the colonies stopped the rebellion by arresting its leader.</p><p>The differences between the people of northern Carolina and southern Carolina became too great.</p><p>The owners of the colony divided Carolina into two parts in 1612.</p><p>The last English colony founded in the New World was Georgia.</p><p>It was established in 1732,</p><p>under King George the Second.</p><p>Georgia was the idea of a man named James Oglethorpe.</p><p>He wanted to solve the debtor problem in England.</p><p>Debtors are people who cannot re-pay money they owe.</p><p>At that time, debtors were placed in prison.</p><p>This made it impossible for them to earn the money needed to pay their debts.</p><p>Oglethorpe wanted to create a colony where debtors could go instead of going to prison.</p><p>He wanted it to be a place where people could have good lives.</p><p>But not many debtors wanted to go to Georgia.</p><p>The people who settled there were much like the people in the other colonies.</p><p>They did not agree with all of Oglethorpe's ideas.</p><p>They wanted to do things he did not believe were right,</p><p>like drinking alcohol and owning slaves.</p><p>The settlers won in the end.</p><p>They did not accept Oglethorpe's ideas about how they should live.</p><p>Life was not easy in Georgia.</p><p>Spaniards and pirates captured ships of all nations along the coast.</p><p>Spain controlled Florida and also claimed Georgia and the Carolinas.</p><p>Border fights were common.</p><p>Oglethorpe lost all his money trying to establish Georgia.</p><p>King George took control of the colony in 1752.</p><p>As all these new colonies were being established nearby,</p><p>the colony of Virginia was growing.</p><p>A way of life was developing there that was very different from that found in the north.</p><p>Most people in Virginia at this time were members of the Church of England.</p><p>Religion was not as important a part of their lives as it was to the people in the north.</p><p>In the New England colonies,</p><p>the clergy were considered the most important people in town.</p><p>In the southern colonies,</p><p>rich land owners were more important.</p><p>People in Virginia did not live in towns,</p><p>as people did in Massachusetts.</p><p>They lived along rivers on small farms or on large farms called plantations.</p><p>Living on a river made it easy to send goods to other nations by ship.</p><p>Virginians were sending large amounts of tobacco to England on those ships.</p><p>It was the crop that earned them the most money.</p><p>Growing tobacco destroys the elements in the soil that support plant life.</p><p>After a few years, nothing grows well on land that has been planted with tobacco.</p><p>A farmer has to stop planting anything on the land every few years.</p><p>That means he needs a lot of land.</p><p>He also needs many workers.</p><p>So tobacco farmers in Virginia began to buy land and workers.</p><p>At first, they bought the services of poor people who had no money or jobs.</p><p>These people were called indentured servants.</p><p>They made an agreement to work for a farmer for a period of four to seven years.</p><p>Then they were freed to work for themselves.</p><p>In 1619, a Dutch ship brought some Africans to Jamestown.</p><p>They had been kidnapped from their homes by African traders and sold to the ship's captain.</p><p>He sold them to the Virginia settlers.</p><p>Those first blacks may have been treated like indentured servants.</p><p>Later, however, colonists decided to keep them as slaves so they would not have to continue paying for workers.</p><p>Indians did not make good slaves because they could run away.</p><p>Blacks could not.</p><p>They had no place to go.</p><p>Slowly, laws were approved in Virginia that made it legal to keep black people as slaves.</p><p>By 1750, there were more Africans in Virginia than any other group.</p><p>History experts continue to debate if slavery caused prejudice in America or prejudice caused slavery.</p><p>No one knows the answer.</p><p>Most Europeans of the 17th century felt they were better than African people.</p><p>The reasons for this included the Africans' different customs.</p><p>religion and the black color of their skin.</p><p>Europeans believed the color black represented danger and death.</p><p>Slavery in the American south affected the history of the United States for many years.</p><p>It divided the people and led to a great civil war.</p><p>But slavery did not start in America.</p><p>That will be our story next week.</p><p>This MAKING OF A NATION program was written by Nancy Steinbach.</p><p>This is Sarah Long.</p><p>And this is Rich Kleinfeldt.</p>
