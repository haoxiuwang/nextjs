<p>Welcome to THE MAKING OF A NATION â€“ American history in VOA Special English.</p><p></p><p>In the United States, October ninth is observed as Leif Erickson Day.</p><p></p><p>It honors the Norse explorer who sailed around the northeastern coast of what we now call North America about one thousand years ago.</p><p></p><p>Leif Erickson and his crew returned home to Greenland with news of a place he called "Vinland."</p><p></p><p>Following his explorations, a few settlements were built.</p><p></p><p>Experts digging in eastern Canada in the 1960s found the remains of a village with houses like those in Greenland, Iceland and Norway.</p><p></p><p>But the Norse did not establish any permanent settlements in North America.</p><p></p><p>Today, as we launch our series from the beginning again, Sarah Long and Rich Kleinfeldt tell the story of early European explorers in North America.</p><p></p><p>About ten hundred, Europe was beginning a period of great change.</p><p></p><p>One reason was the religious wars known as the crusades.</p><p></p><p>These wars were efforts by Europeans who were mainly Roman Catholic Christians.</p><p></p><p>They wanted to force Muslims out of what is now the Middle East.</p><p></p><p>The crusades began at the end of the eleventh century.</p><p></p><p>They continued for about two hundred years.</p><p></p><p>The presence of European armies in the Middle East increased trade, which was controlled by businessmen in Venice and other Italian city-states.</p><p></p><p>The businessmen were earning large profits by transporting and supplying the warring armies.</p><p></p><p>When the European crusaders returned home, they brought with them some new and useful products.</p><p></p><p>The products included spices, perfumes, silk cloth, steel products and drugs.</p><p></p><p>Such products became highly valued all over Europe.</p><p></p><p>Increased trade resulted which led to the growth of towns.</p><p></p><p>It also created a large number of rich European businessmen.</p><p></p><p>The European nations were growing.</p><p></p><p>They developed armies and governments.</p><p></p><p>These had to be paid for by taxes from the people.</p><p></p><p>By the 15th century, European countries were ready to explore new parts of the world.</p><p></p><p>The first explorers were the Portuguese.</p><p></p><p>By 1400, they wanted to control the Eastern spice trade.</p><p></p><p>European businessmen did not want to continue paying Venetian and Arab traders for their costly spices.</p><p></p><p>They wanted to set up trade themselves.</p><p></p><p>If they could sail to Asia directly for these products, the resulting trade would bring huge profits.</p><p></p><p>The leader of Portugal's exploration efforts was Prince Henry, a son of King John the first.</p><p></p><p>He was interested in sea travel and exploration.</p><p></p><p>So he became known as Henry the Navigator.</p><p></p><p>Prince Henry brought experts to his country and studied the sciences involved in exploration.</p><p></p><p>He built an observatory to study the stars.</p><p></p><p>Portuguese sea captains led their ships around the west coast of Africa hoping to find a path to India and East Asia.</p><p></p><p>They finally found the end of the African continent, the area called the Cape of Good Hope.</p><p></p><p>It took the Portuguese only about fifty years to take control of the spice trade.</p><p></p><p>They established trading colonies in Africa, the Persian Gulf, India and China.</p><p></p><p>Improvements in technology helped them succeed.</p><p></p><p>One improvement was a new kind of ship.</p><p></p><p>It could sail more easily through ocean storms and winds.</p><p></p><p>Other inventions like the compass permitted them to sail out of sight of land.</p><p></p><p>The Portuguese also armed their ships with modern cannon.</p><p></p><p>They used these weapons to battle Muslim and East Asian traders.</p><p></p><p>The other European nations would not permit Portugal to control this trade for long, however.</p><p></p><p>Spain's Queen Isabella and King Ferdinand agreed to provide ships, crew and supplies for an exploration by an Italian seaman, Christopher Columbus.</p><p></p><p>Columbus thought the shortest way to reach the East was to sail west across the Atlantic Ocean.</p><p></p><p>He was right.</p><p></p><p>But he also was wrong.</p><p></p><p>He believed the world was much smaller than it is.</p><p></p><p>He did not imagine the existence of other lands and another huge ocean area between Europe and East Asia.</p><p></p><p>Columbus and a crew of eighty-eight men left Spain on August third, 1492, in three ships.</p><p></p><p> On October twelfth, they stood on land again on an island that Columbus named San Salvador.</p><p></p><p>He explored it, and the nearby islands of what is now known as Cuba and Hispaniola.</p><p></p><p>He believed they were part of the coast of East Asia, which was called the Indies.</p><p></p><p>He called the people he found there Indians.</p><p></p><p>Columbus left about forty men on the island to build a fort from the wood of one of the ships.</p><p></p><p>He returned to Spain with captured natives, birds, plants and gold.</p><p></p><p>Columbus was considered a national hero when he reached Spain in March, 1493.</p><p></p><p>Columbus returned across the Atlantic Ocean to the Caribbean area five months later.</p><p></p><p>This time, he had many more men and all the animals and equipment needed to start a colony on Hispaniola.</p><p></p><p>He found that the protective fort built by his men had been destroyed by fire.</p><p></p><p>Columbus did not find any of his men.</p><p></p><p>Seven months later, Columbus sent five ships back to Spain.</p><p></p><p>They carried Indians to be sold as slaves.</p><p></p><p>Columbus also sailed back to Spain leaving behind some settlers who were not happy with conditions.</p><p></p><p>Christopher Columbus made another trip in 1498, with six ships.</p><p></p><p>This time he saw the coast of South America.</p><p></p><p>The settlers were so unhappy with conditions in the new colony, Columbus was sent back to Spain as a prisoner.</p><p></p><p>Spain's rulers pardoned him.</p><p></p><p>In 1502, Columbus made his final voyage to what some were calling the New World.</p><p></p><p>He stayed on the island of Jamaica until he returned home in 1504.</p><p></p><p>During all his trips, Columbus explored islands and waterways, searching for a passage to the Indies.</p><p></p><p>He never found it.</p><p></p><p>He also did not find spices or great amounts of gold.</p><p></p><p>Yet, he always believed that he had found the Indies.</p><p></p><p>He refused to recognize that it was really a new world.</p><p></p><p>Evidence of this was all around him -- strange plants that were not known in either Europe or Asia and a different people who did not understand any language spoken in the East.</p><p></p><p>Columbus' voyages, however, opened up the new world.</p><p></p><p>Others later explored all of North America.</p><p></p><p>You may be wondering about the name of this new land.</p><p></p><p>If Christopher Columbus was the first European to attempt to settle the new world, why is it called "America"? The answer lies with the name of an Italian explorer, Amerigo Vespucci.</p><p></p><p>He visited the coast of South America in 1499.</p><p></p><p>He wrote stories about his experiences that were widely read in Europe.</p><p></p><p>In 1507, a German mapmaker read Vespucci's stories.</p><p></p><p>He decided that the writer had discovered the new world and suggested that it be called America in his honor.</p><p></p><p>So it was.</p><p></p><p>Spanish explorers sought to find gold and power in the New World.</p><p></p><p>They also wanted to expand belief in what they considered to be the true religion, Christianity.</p><p></p><p>The first of these Spanish explorers was Juan Ponce de Leon.</p><p></p><p>He landed on North America in 1513.</p><p></p><p>He explored the eastern coast of what is now the southern state of Florida.</p><p></p><p>He was searching for a special kind of water that people in Europe believed existed.</p><p></p><p>They believed that this water could make old people young again.</p><p></p><p>Ponce de Leon never found it.</p><p></p><p>Also in 1513, Vasco Nunez de Balboa crossed the Isthmus of Panama and reached the Pacific Ocean.</p><p></p><p>In 1519, Hernan Cortes landed an army in Mexico and destroyed the empire of the Aztec Indians.</p><p></p><p>That same year Ferdinand Magellan began his three-year voyage around the world.</p><p></p><p>And in the 1530s, Francisco Pizarro destroyed the Inca Indian empire in Peru.</p><p></p><p>Ten years later, Francisco Vasquez de Coronado had marched as far north as the central American state of Kansas and west to the Grand Canyon.</p><p></p><p>About the same time, Hernan de Soto reached the Mississippi River.</p><p></p><p>Fifty years after Columbus first landed in San Salvador, Spain claimed a huge area of America.</p><p></p><p>The riches of these new lands made Spain the greatest power in Europe.</p><p></p><p>But other nations refused to accept Spain's claim to rights in the new world.</p><p></p><p>Explorers from England, France and Holland also were traveling to North America.</p><p></p><p>That will be our story next week.</p><p></p><p>This MAKING OF A NATION program was written by Nancy Steinbach and produced by Paul Thompson.</p><p></p><p>This is Rich Kleinfeldt.</p><p></p><p>And this is Sarah Long.</p><p></p>
