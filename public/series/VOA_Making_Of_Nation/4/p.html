<p>This is Rich Kleinfeldt.</p><p>And this is Sarah Long with THE MAKING OF A NATION,</p><p>a VOA Special English program about the history of the United States.</p><p>Today, we tell about early Native Americans.</p><p>Scientists believe that </p><p>the native peoples of America </p><p>came here thousands of years ago </p><p>during the last ice age.</p><p>These people settled the land </p><p>from the cold northern areas </p><p>to the extreme end of South America.</p><p>As the groups of people settled</p><p>different parts of the land,</p><p>they developed their own languages,</p><p>their own cultures and their own religions.</p><p>Each group's story is important </p><p>in the history of the Americas.</p><p>However, it is perhaps </p><p>the tribes of the central part of the United States </p><p>that are most recognized.</p><p>They will be our story today.</p><p>In 1804, Merriwether Lewis and William Clark </p><p>led a group of explorers to the Pacific Ocean.</p><p>They were the first educated Americans </p><p>to see some of the native tribes of the Great Plains.</p><p>And they were the first white people </p><p>these Native American people had ever seen.</p><p>When the group of explorers neared </p><p>the eastern side of the great Rocky Mountains,</p><p>they met with a tribe of Indians called the Shoshoni.</p><p>Merriwether Lewis was the first to see them.</p><p>Let us imagine </p><p>we are with Merriwether Lewis </p><p>near the Rocky Mountains almost two hundred years ago.</p><p>Across a small hill,</p><p>a group of sixty Shoshoni men are riding toward us.</p><p>The first thing we see is that </p><p>these men are ready for war.</p><p>Each is armed with a bow and arrows.</p><p>Some carry long poles </p><p>with a sharp knife on the end.</p><p>They are riding very fast.</p><p>Some horses seem to be without riders.</p><p>But a closer look shows that </p><p>the men are hanging off the sides,</p><p>or under the horseâ€™s neck.</p><p>They are using the horses' bodies as protection.</p><p>The horses are painted </p><p>with many different designs </p><p>that use blue, black, red or other colors.</p><p>Later we learn that </p><p>each design has a special meaning </p><p>for the man who owns the horse.</p><p>Each one tells a story.</p><p>For example,</p><p>the man riding one horse </p><p>is a leader during battle.</p><p>Another has killed an enemy in battle.</p><p>One of the designs </p><p>protects the horse and rider.</p><p>As they come nearer,</p><p>the Shoshoni group sees that </p><p>we are not ready for war.</p><p>They slow their horses </p><p>but are still very careful.</p><p>Merriwether Lewis holds up a open hand </p><p>as a sign of peace.</p><p>The leader of the Shoshoni </p><p>does the same.</p><p>They come closer.</p><p>The Shoshoni are dressed in clothes </p><p>made from animal skin.</p><p>Most of these skins </p><p>are from deer or the American buffalo.</p><p>The shirts they wear </p><p>have many designs,</p><p>and tell stories </p><p>like the designs on the horses.</p><p>One shows a man </p><p>has fought in a battle.</p><p>Another shows a man </p><p>has been in many raids to capture horses.</p><p>Still another shows the man </p><p>saved the life of a friend.</p><p>Captain Lewis smiles at these men.</p><p>He again makes a hand sign </p><p>that means peace.</p><p>The signs are now returned.</p><p>Lewis and the Shoshoni chief </p><p>cannot speak each other's language.</p><p>They can communicate using hand signs.</p><p>One young Shoshoni man comes near.</p><p>He drops to the ground from his horse.</p><p>He is tall and looks strong.</p><p>His hair is black in color and long.</p><p>He wears one long bird feather </p><p>in the back of his hair.</p><p>Some of his hair </p><p>is held in place by animal fur.</p><p>His arms have been painted </p><p>with long lines.</p><p>We learn that each line </p><p>represents a battle.</p><p>There are many lines.</p><p>But we leave the Shoshoni </p><p>without him adding another one.</p><p>The Shoshoni were only one of many tribes of native people </p><p>who lived in the Great Plains area.</p><p>The life, culture and society of these tribes developed </p><p>because of the land that was their home.</p><p>The Great Plains today is still huge.</p><p>Even in a car,</p><p>traveling at one hundred kilometers an hour,</p><p>it can take two long days of driving </p><p>to cross the Great Plains.</p><p>The plains reach </p><p>from several hundred kilometers north in Canada </p><p>across the middle of the continent </p><p>to Mexico in the south.</p><p>In the East,</p><p>the Great Plains begin </p><p>near the Mississippi River </p><p>and go west to the huge Rocky Mountains.</p><p>It is the center of the United States.</p><p>There are big rivers here, deserts and mountains.</p><p>Other areas are so flat that </p><p>a person can see for hundreds of kilometers.</p><p>Millions of kilometers of this land </p><p>were once covered by a thick ocean of grass.</p><p>The grass provided food for an animal </p><p>that made possible the culture of the Indians of the Great Plains.</p><p>The grass fed the bison,</p><p>the American buffalo.</p><p>The buffalo was the center of </p><p>native Indian culture in the Great Plains.</p><p>The huge animal provided meat for the Indians.</p><p>But it was much more than just food.</p><p>It was an important part of the religion </p><p>of most of the native people in the Great Plains.</p><p>The Lakota tribe is one of the people of the Great Plains.</p><p>The Lakota are sometimes called the Sioux.</p><p>They believed that </p><p>everything necessary to life was within the buffalo.</p><p>Another Plains tribe,</p><p>the Blackfeet, called the animal </p><p>"My home and my protection."</p><p>The back of the huge buffalo</p><p>provided thick skin </p><p>that was used to make homes for the Plains Indians.</p><p>Other parts were made into clothing.</p><p>Still other parts became warm blankets.</p><p>Buffalo bones were made into tools.</p><p>Nothing of the animal was wasted.</p><p>No one knows how many buffalo </p><p>were in North America </p><p>when Merriwether Lewis first met the Shoshoni.</p><p>But experts say it was probably </p><p>between sixty million to seventy-five million.</p><p>Another animal also helped make possible </p><p>the Indian cultures of the Great Plains.</p><p>Native Americans first </p><p>called these animals mystery dogs,</p><p>or big dogs.</p><p>They had no word </p><p>for this animal in their language.</p><p>We know it as the horse.</p><p>No horses existed in North America </p><p>before the Spanish arrived in the 1500s </p><p>in what is now the southern part of the United States.</p><p>Native peoples hunted,</p><p>moved and traveled by foot.</p><p>Traveling long distances was difficult,</p><p>so was hunting buffalo.</p><p>The horse greatly changed the life </p><p>of all the people of the Great Plains.</p><p>It gave them a method of travel.</p><p>It provided a way </p><p>to carry food and equipment.</p><p>It made it easier and safer </p><p>to follow and hunt the buffalo.</p><p>The horse made it possible </p><p>to attack an enemy far away and return safely.</p><p>The number of horses owned </p><p>became the measure of a tribe's wealth.</p><p>Spanish settlers rode horses </p><p>to the small town of Santa Fe </p><p>in what is now the southwestern state of New Mexico.</p><p>They arrived there in about the year 1609.</p><p>It is not known </p><p>how native peoples in Santa Fe </p><p>got the first horses in the country.</p><p>Perhaps they traded for them.</p><p>Perhaps they captured them in an attack.</p><p>Many tribes soon were trading </p><p>and capturing horses.</p><p>By the 1750s,</p><p>all the tribes of the Great Plains had horses.</p><p>They had become experts at raising,</p><p>training and riding horses.</p><p>They became experts at horse medicine.</p><p>Each Indian of the Great Plains could </p><p>ride a horse by the age of five.</p><p>As an adult,</p><p>a young man would have a special horse for work.</p><p>Another horse would be trained for hunting.</p><p>And another would be trained for war.</p><p>An Indian warrior's success </p><p>depended upon how closely </p><p>he and his horses worked together.</p><p>George Catlin was an artist </p><p>who traveled a great deal </p><p>in the early American west.</p><p>He painted many beautiful pictures of American Indians.</p><p>Mr.Catlin said the Plains Indian </p><p>was the greatest horse rider </p><p>the world has ever known.</p><p>He said the moment </p><p>an Indian rider laid a hand on his horse </p><p>he became part of the animal.</p><p>The buffalo and horse were </p><p>extremely important to the Plains Indian.</p><p>Because the horse made hunting easier,</p><p>more time could be spent on things like art.</p><p>The Plains Indians began to </p><p>make designs on their clothing,</p><p>and on special blankets their horses wore.</p><p>Even common objects were painted with designs.</p><p>The coming of white settlers to the Great Plains </p><p>was the beginning of the end </p><p>of the buffalo and horse culture of the American Indians.</p><p>Settlers did not want buffalo </p><p>destroying their crops.</p><p>The buffalo were killed.</p><p>By the year 1885,</p><p>the Indians of the Great Plains </p><p>were mostly restricted to </p><p>area of land called reservations.</p><p>Many of the Great Plains tribes </p><p>that survive today </p><p>work hard to keep their traditional cultures.</p><p>They produce art, music, and clothing.</p><p>They keep alive the memory of these people </p><p>who added greatly to the history of America.</p><p>This MAKING OF A NATION program
