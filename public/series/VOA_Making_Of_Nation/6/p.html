<p>This is Rich Kleinfeldt.</p><p>And this is Sarah Long with THE MAKING OF A NATION,</p><p>a VOA Special English program about the history of the United States.</p><p>Today, we tell about the movement of European settlers throughout northeastern America.</p><p>And we tell how the separate colonies developed in this area.</p><p>The Puritans were one of the largest groups from England to settle in the northeastern area called Massachusetts.</p><p>They began arriving in 1630.</p><p>The Puritans had formed the Massachusetts Bay Company in England.</p><p>The king had given the company an area of land between the Charles and Merrimack rivers.</p><p>The Puritans were Protestants who did not agree with the Anglican Church.</p><p>The Puritans wanted to change the church to make it more holy.</p><p>They were able to live as they wanted in Massachusetts.</p><p>Soon they became the largest religious group.</p><p>By 1690, 50,000 people were living in Massachusetts.</p><p>Puritans thought their religion was the only true religion and everyone should believe in it.</p><p>They also believed that church leaders should lead the local government,</p><p>and all people in the colony should pay to support the Puritan church.</p><p>The Puritans thought it was the job of government leaders to tell people what to believe.</p><p>Some people did not agree with the Puritans who had become leaders of the colony.</p><p>One of those who disagreed was a Puritan minister named Roger Williams.</p><p>Roger Williams believed as all Puritans did that other European religions were wrong.</p><p>He thought the Native Indian religions were wrong too.</p><p>But he did not believe in trying to force others to agree with him.</p><p>He thought that it was a sin to punish or kill anyone in the name of Christianity.</p><p>And he thought that only church members should pay to support their church.</p><p>Roger Williams began speaking and writing about his ideas.</p><p>He wrote a book saying it was wrong to punish people for having different beliefs.</p><p>Then he said that the European settlers were stealing the Indians' land.</p><p>He said the king of England had no right to permit people to settle on land that was not his,</p><p>but belonged to the Indians.</p><p>The Puritan leaders of the Massachusetts Bay Colony forced Roger Williams to leave the colony in 1636.</p><p>He traveled south.</p><p>He bought land from local Indians and started a city, Providence.</p><p>The Parliament in England gave him permission to establish a new colony, Rhode Island,</p><p>with Providence as its capital.</p><p>As a colony, Rhode Island accepted people of all religious beliefs,</p><p>including Catholics, Quakers, Jews and even people who denied the existence of God.</p><p>Roger Williams also believed that governments should have no connection to a church.</p><p>This idea of separating church and state was very new.</p><p>Later it became one of the most important of all America's governing ideas.</p><p>Other colonies were started by people who left Massachusetts to seek land.</p><p>One was Connecticut.</p><p>A group led by Puritan minister Thomas Hooker left Boston in 1636 and went west.</p><p>They settled near the Connecticut River.</p><p>Others soon joined them.</p><p>Other groups from Massachusetts traveled north to find new homes.</p><p>The king of England had given two friends a large piece of land in the north.</p><p>The friends divided it.</p><p>John Mason took what later became the colony of New Hampshire.</p><p>Ferdinando Gorges took the area that later became the state of Maine.</p><p>It never became a colony, however.</p><p>It remained a part of Massachusetts until after the United States was created.</p><p>The area known today as New York State was settled by the Dutch.</p><p>They called it New Netherland.</p><p>Their country was the Netherlands.</p><p>It was a great world power, with colonies all over the world.</p><p>A business called the Dutch West India Company owned most of the colonies.</p><p>The Dutch claimed American land because of explorations by Henry Hudson,</p><p>an Englishman working for the Netherlands.</p><p>The land the Dutch claimed was between the Puritans in the north and the Anglican tobacco farmers in the south.</p><p>The Dutch were not interested in settling the territory.</p><p>They wanted to earn money.</p><p>The Dutch West India Company built trading posts on the rivers claimed by the Netherlands.</p><p>People in Europe wanted to buy goods made from the skins of animals trapped there.</p><p>In 1626, the Dutch West India Company bought two islands from the local Indians.</p><p>The islands are Manhattan Island and Long Island.</p><p>Traditional stories say the Dutch paid for the islands with some trade goods worth about twenty-four dollars.</p><p>The Dutch West India Company tried to find people to settle in America.</p><p>But few Dutch wanted to leave Europe.</p><p>So the colony welcomed people from other colonies, and other countries.</p><p>These people built a town on Manhattan Island.</p><p>They called it New Amsterdam.</p><p>It was soon full of people who had arrived on ships from faraway places.</p><p>It was said you could hear as many as 18 different languages spoken in New Amsterdam.</p><p>In 1655, the governor of New Netherland took control of a nearby Swedish colony on Delaware Bay.</p><p>In 1664, the English did the same to the Dutch.</p><p>The English seized control of New Amsterdam and called it New York.</p><p>That ended Dutch control of the territory that now is the states of New York, New Jersey and Delaware.</p><p>Most of the Dutch in New Amsterdam did not leave.</p><p>The English permitted everyone to stay.</p><p>They let the Dutch have religious freedom.</p><p>The Dutch were just not in control any more.</p><p>The Duke of York owned the area now.</p><p>He was the brother of King Charles the Second of England.</p><p>The king gave some of the land near New York to two friends,</p><p>Sir George Carteret and Lord John Berkeley.</p><p>They called it New Jersey, after the English island where Carteret was born.</p><p>The two men wrote a plan of government for their colony.</p><p>It created an assembly that represented the settlers.</p><p>It provided for freedom of religion.</p><p>Men could vote in New Jersey whatever their religion.</p><p>Soon, people from all parts of Europe were living in New Jersey.</p><p>Then King Charles took control of the area.</p><p>He sent a royal governor to rule.</p><p>But the colonists were permitted to make their own laws through the elected assembly.</p><p>The king of England did the same in each colony he controlled.</p><p>He collected taxes from the people who lived there,</p><p>but permitted them to govern themselves.</p><p>One religious group that was not welcome in England was the Quakers.</p><p>Quakers call themselves Friends.</p><p>They believe that each person has an inner light that leads them to God.</p><p>Quakers believe they do not need a religious leader to tell them what is right.</p><p>So, they had no clergy.</p><p>Quakers believe that all people are equal.</p><p>The Quakers in England refused to recognize the king as more important than anyone else.</p><p>They also refused to pay taxes to support the Anglican Church.</p><p>Quakers believe that it is always wrong to kill.</p><p>So they would not fight even when they were forced to join the army.</p><p>They also refuse to promise loyalty to a king or government or flag or anyone but God.</p><p>The English did not like the Quakers for all these reasons.</p><p>Many Quakers wanted to leave England,</p><p>but they were not welcome in most American colonies.</p><p>One Quaker changed this.</p><p>His name was William Penn.</p><p>William Penn was not born a Quaker.</p><p>He became one as a young man.</p><p>His father was an Anglican, and a good friend of the king.</p><p>King Charles borrowed money from William's father.</p><p>When his father died, William Penn asked that the debt be paid with land in America.</p><p>In 1681, the king gave William Penn land which the King's Council named Pennsylvania, meaning Penn's woods.</p><p>The Quakers now had their own colony.</p><p>It was between the Puritans in the north and the Anglicans in the south.</p><p>William Penn said the colony should be a place where everyone could live by Quaker ideas.</p><p>That meant treating all people as equals and honoring all religions.</p><p>It also meant that anyone could be elected.</p><p>In most other colonies, people could believe any religion,</p><p>but they could not vote or hold office unless they were a member of the majority church.</p><p>In Pennsylvania, all religions were equal.</p><p>This MAKING OF A NATION program was written by Nancy Steinbach and produced by Paul
