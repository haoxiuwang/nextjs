<p>This is Rich Kleinfeldt.</p><p>And this is Sarah Long with THE MAKING OF A NATION, a VOA Special English program about the history of the United States.</p><p>Today, we continue the story of the American Revolution against Britain in the late 1700s.</p><p>Battles had been fought between Massachusetts soldiers and British military forces in the towns of Lexington and Concord.</p><p>Yet, war had not been declared.</p><p>Even so, citizen soldiers in each of the thirteen American colonies were ready to fight.</p><p>This was the first question faced by the Second Continental Congress meeting in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.</p><p>Who was going to organize these men into an army?  Delegates to the Congress decided that the man for the job was George Washington.</p><p>He had experience fighting in the French and Indian War.</p><p>He was thought to know more than any other colonist about being a military commander.</p><p>Washington accepted the position.</p><p>But he said he would not take any money for leading the new Continental Army.</p><p>Washington left Philadelphia for Boston to take command of the soldiers there.</p><p>Delegates to the Second Continental Congress made one more attempt to prevent war with Britain.</p><p>They sent another message to King George.</p><p>They asked him to consider their problems and try to find a solution.</p><p>The king would not even read the message.</p><p>You may wonder:  Why would the delegates try to prevent war if the people were ready to fight?  </p><p>The answer is that most members of the Congress -- and most of the colonists -- were not yet ready to break away from Britain.</p><p>They continued to believe they could have greater self-government and still be part of the British Empire.</p><p>But that was not to be.</p><p>Two days after the Congress appointed George Washington as army commander, colonists and British troops fought the first major battle of the American Revolution.</p><p>It was called the Battle of Bunker Hill, although it really involved two hills:  Bunker and Breed's.</p><p>Both are just across the Charles River from the city of Boston.</p><p>Massachusetts soldiers dug positions on Breed's Hill one night in June, 1775.</p><p>By morning, the hill was filled with troops.</p><p>The British started to attack from across the river.</p><p>The Americans had very little gunpowder.</p><p>They were forced to wait until the British had crossed the river and were almost on top of them before they fired their guns.</p><p>Their commander reportedly told them:  Do not fire until you see the whites of the British soldiers' eyes.</p><p>The British climbed the hill.</p><p>The Americans fired.</p><p>A second group climbed the hill.</p><p>The Americans fired again.</p><p>The third time, the British reached the top, but the Americans were gone.</p><p>They had left because they had no more gunpowder.</p><p>The British captured Breed's Hill.</p><p>More than one thousand had been killed or wounded in the attempt.</p><p>The Americans lost about four hundred.</p><p>That battle greatly reduced whatever hope was left for a negotiated settlement.</p><p>King George declared the colonies to be in open rebellion.</p><p>And the Continental Congress approved a declaration condemning everything the British had done since 1763.</p><p>The American colonists fought several battles against British troops during 1775.</p><p>Yet the colonies were still not ready to declare war.</p><p>Then, the following year, the British decided to use Hessian soldiers to fight against the colonists.</p><p>Hessians were mostly German mercenaries who fought for anyone who paid them.</p><p>The colonists feared these soldiers and hated Britain for using them.</p><p>At about the same time, Thomas Paine published a little document that had a great effect on the citizens of America.</p><p>He named it, "Common Sense."  It attacked King George, as well as the idea of government by kings.</p><p>It called for independence.</p><p>About one hundred fifty thousand copies of "Common Sense" were sold in America.</p><p>Everyone talked about it.</p><p>As a result, the Continental Congress began to act.</p><p>It opened American ports to foreign shipping.</p><p>It urged colonists to establish state governments and to write constitutions.</p><p>On June seventh, delegate Richard Henry Lee of Virginia proposed a resolution for independence.</p><p>The resolution was not approved immediately.</p><p>Declaring independence was an extremely serious step.</p><p>Signing such a document would make delegates to the Continental Congress traitors to Britain.</p><p>They would be killed if captured by the British.</p><p>The delegates wanted the world to understand what they were doing, and why.</p><p>So they appointed a committee to write a document giving the reasons for their actions.</p><p>One member of the committee was the Virginian, Thomas Jefferson.</p><p>He had already written a report criticizing the British form of government.</p><p>So the other committee members asked him to prepare the new document.</p><p>They said he was the best writer in the group.</p><p>They were right.</p><p>It took him seventeen days to complete the document that the delegates approved on July fourth, 1776.</p><p>It was America's Declaration of Independence.</p><p>Jefferson's document was divided into two parts.</p><p>The first part explained the right of any people to revolt.</p><p>It also described the ideas the Americans used to create a new, republican form of government.</p><p>The Declaration of Independence begins this way:</p><p>When in the course of human events, it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political bands which have connected them to another, </p><p>and to assume among the powers of the earth, the separate and equal station to which the laws of nature and of Nature's God entitle them, </p><p>a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to the separation.</p><p>Jefferson continued by saying that all people are equal in the eyes of God.</p><p>Therefore, governments can exist only by permission of the people they govern.</p><p>He wrote:</p><p>We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal and that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, </p><p>that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.</p><p>That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed.</p><p>The next part states why the American colonies decided to separate from Britain:</p><p>That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or abolish it.</p><p>This is why the Americans were rebelling against England.</p><p>The British believed the Americans were violating their law.</p><p>Jefferson rejected this idea.</p><p>He claimed that the British treatment of the American colonies violated the natural laws of God.</p><p>He and others believed a natural law exists that is more powerful than a king.</p><p>The idea of a natural law had been developed by British and French philosophers more than one hundred years earlier.</p><p>Jefferson had studied these philosophers in school.</p><p>In later years, however, he said he did not re-read these ideas while he was writing the Declaration.</p><p>He said the words came straight from his heart.</p><p>The second part of the Declaration lists twenty-seven complaints by the American colonies against the British government.</p><p>The major ones concerned British taxes on Americans and the presence of British troops in the colonies.</p><p>After the list of complaints, Jefferson wrote this strong statement of independence:</p><p>That these United Colonies are, and of Right ought to be Free and Independent States; </p><p>that they are Absolved from all Allegiance to the British Crown and that all political connection between them and the State of Great Britain, </p><p>is and ought to be totally dissolved; and that as Free and Independent States they have the full Power to levy War, </p><p>conduct Peace, contract Alliances, establish Commerce, and do all other Acts and Things which Independent States may of right do.</p><p>The last statement of the Declaration of Independence was meant to influence the delegates into giving strong support for that most serious step -- revolution:</p><p>And for the support of this Declaration, with a firm reliance on the protection of divine Providence </p><p>we mutually pledge to each other our Lives, our Fortunes and our sacred Honor.</p><p>Today's MAKING OF A NATION program was written by Nancy Steinbach.</p><p>Shep Oâ€™Neal read the Declaration of Independence.</p><p>This is Rich Kleinfeldt.</p><p>And this is Sarah Long.</p>
