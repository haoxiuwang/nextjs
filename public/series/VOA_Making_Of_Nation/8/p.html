<p>This is Rich Kleinfeldt.</p><p>And this is Sarah Long with THE MAKING OF A NATION, a VOA Special English program about the history of the United States.</p><p>Today, we tell about slavery, and how it affected the history of the United States.</p><p>Slavery is one person controlling or owning another.</p><p>Some history experts say it began following the development of farming about ten thousand years ago.</p><p>People forced prisoners of war to work for them.</p><p>Other slaves were criminals or people who could not re-pay money they owed.</p><p>Experts say the first known slaves existed in the Sumerian society of what is now Iraq more than five thousand years ago.</p><p>Slavery also existed among people in China, India, Africa, the Middle East and the Americas.</p><p>It expanded as trade and industry increased.</p><p>This increase created a demand for a labor force to produce goods for export.</p><p>Slaves did most of the work.</p><p>Most ancient people thought of slavery as a natural condition that could happen to anyone at any time.</p><p>Few saw it as evil or unfair.</p><p>In most cities, slaves could be freed by their owners and become citizens.</p><p>In later times, slaves provided the labor needed to produce products that were in demand.</p><p>Sugar was one of these products.</p><p>Italians established large sugar farms beginning around the twelfth century.</p><p>They used slaves from Russia and other parts of Europe to do the work.</p><p>By the year 1300, African blacks had begun to replace the Russian slaves.</p><p>They were bought or captured from North African Arabs, who used them as slaves for years.</p><p>By the 1500s, Spain and Portugal had American colonies.</p><p>The Europeans made native Indians work in large farms and mines in the colonies.</p><p>Most of the Indians died from European diseases and poor treatment.</p><p>So the Spanish and Portuguese began to bring in people from West Africa as slaves.</p><p>France, Britain and the Netherlands did the same in their American colonies.</p><p>England's southern colonies in North America developed a farm economy that could not survive without slave labor.</p><p>Many slaves lived on large farms called plantations.</p><p>These large farms produced important crops traded by the colony, crops such as cotton and tobacco.</p><p>Each plantation was like a small village owned by one family.</p><p>That family lived in a large house, usually facing a river.</p><p>Many separate buildings were needed on a plantation.</p><p>For example, a building was needed for cooking.</p><p>And buildings were needed for workers to produce goods such as furniture that were used on the plantation.</p><p>The plantation business was farming.</p><p>So there also were barns for animals and buildings for holding and drying crops.</p><p>There was a house to smoke meat so could be kept safely.</p><p>And there was a place on the river from which goods were sent to England on ships.</p><p>The plantation owner controlled the farm and saw that it earned money.</p><p>He supervised, fed and clothed the people living on it, including the slaves.</p><p>Big plantations might have two hundred slaves.</p><p>They worked in the fields on crops that would be sold or eaten by the people who lived on the plantation.</p><p>They also raised animals for meat and milk.</p><p>Field slaves worked very long and hard.</p><p>They worked each day from the time the sun rose until it set.</p><p>Many of these slaves lived in extremely poor conditions in small houses with no heat or furniture.</p><p>Sometimes, five or ten people lived together in one room.</p><p>House slaves usually lived in the owner's house.</p><p>They did the cooking and cleaning in the house.</p><p>House slaves worked fewer hours than field slaves, but were more closely supervised by the owner and his family.</p><p>Laws approved in the southern colonies made it illegal for slaves to marry, own property or earn their freedom.</p><p>These laws also did not permit slaves to be educated, or even to learn to read.</p><p>But some owners permitted their slaves to earn their freedom, or gave them money for good work.</p><p>Other owners punished slaves to get them to work.</p><p>These punishments included beatings, withholding food and threatening to sell members of a slave's family.</p><p>Some plantation owners executed slaves suspected of serious crimes by hanging them or burning them alive.</p><p>History experts say that people who were rich enough to own many slaves became leaders in their local areas.</p><p>They were members of the local governments.</p><p>They attended meetings of the legislatures in the capitals of their colonies usually two times a year.</p><p>Slave owners had the time and the education to greatly influence political life in the southern colonies, </p><p>because the hard work on their farms was done by slaves.</p><p>Today, most people in the world condemn slavery.</p><p>That was not true in the early years of the American nation.</p><p>Many Americans thought slavery was evil, but necessary.</p><p>Yet owning slaves was common among the richer people in the early 1700s.</p><p>Many of the leaders in the colonies who fought for American independence owned slaves.</p><p>This was true in the northern colonies as well as the southern ones.</p><p>One example is the famous American diplomat, inventor and businessman Benjamin Franklin.</p><p>He owned slaves for thirty years and sold them at his general store.</p><p>But his ideas about slavery changed during his long life.</p><p>Benjamin Franklin started the first schools to teach blacks and later argued for their freedom.</p><p>Slavery did not become a force in the northern colonies mainly because of economic reasons.</p><p>Cold weather and poor soil could not support such a farm economy as was found in the South.</p><p>As a result, the North came to depend on manufacturing and trade.</p><p>Trade was the way colonists got the English goods they needed.</p><p>It was also the way to earn money by selling products found in the New World.</p><p>New England became a center for such trade across the seas.</p><p>The people who lived there became shipbuilders so they could send the products to England.</p><p>They used local wood to build the ships.</p><p>They also sold wood and wood products.</p><p>They became businessmen carrying goods around the world.</p><p>The New England shipbuilding towns near the Atlantic Ocean grew quickly as a result.</p><p>The largest of these towns was Boston, Massachusetts.</p><p>By 1720, it had more than ten thousand people.</p><p>Only two towns in England were larger: London and Bristol.</p><p>More than twenty-five percent of the men in Boston had invested in shipping or worked in it.</p><p>Ship captains and businessmen held most of the public offices.</p><p>The American colonies traded goods such as whale oil, ginger, iron, wood, and rum, an alcoholic drink made from sugarcane.</p><p>Ships carried these goods from the New England colonies to Africa.</p><p>There, they were traded for African people.</p><p>The Africans had been captured by enemy tribesmen and sold to African slave traders.</p><p>The New England boat captains would buy as many as they could put on their ships.</p><p>The conditions on these ships were very cruel.</p><p>The Africans were put in so tightly they could hardly move.</p><p>Some were chained.</p><p>Many killed themselves rather than live under such conditions.</p><p>Others died of sicknesses they developed on the ship.</p><p>Yet many did survive the trip, and became slaves in the southern colonies, or in the Caribbean islands.</p><p>Black slaves were needed to work on Caribbean sugar plantations.</p><p>The southern American colonies needed them to work on the tobacco and rice plantations.</p><p>By 1750, almost twenty-five percent of the total number of people in the American colonies were black slaves.</p><p>From the 1500s to the 1800s, Europeans sent about twelve million black slaves from Africa to America.</p><p>Almost two million of them died on the way.</p><p>History experts say English ships carried the greatest number of Africans into slavery.</p><p>One slave ship captain came to hate what he was doing, and turned to religion.</p><p>His name was John Newton.</p><p>He stopped taking part in slave trade and became a leader in the Anglican Church.</p><p>He is famous for having written this song, "Amazing Grace".</p><p>This program was written by
