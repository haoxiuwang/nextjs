<p>This is Rich Kleinfeldt.</p><p>And this is Ray Freeman with THE MAKING OF A NATION,</p><p>a VOA Special English program about the history of the United States.</p><p>Our story today is a sad one.</p><p>It is the story of a clash of peoples, religions, ideas, and cultures.</p><p>It is a story of strongly held ideas and a lack of compromise.</p><p>It is the story of the relations between Europeans and the natives</p><p>who had lived for thousands of years in the area we now call North America.</p><p>Many different Native American groups lived on the East Coast of what would become United States.</p><p>They spoke many different languages.</p><p>Some were farmers, some were hunters.</p><p>Some fought many wars, others were peaceful.</p><p>These groups are called tribes.</p><p>Their names are known to most Americans...the Senecas, the Mohawks, the Seminole,</p><p>the Cherokee to name only a few.</p><p>These tribes had developed their own cultures many years before the first European settlers arrived.</p><p>Each had a kind of religion,</p><p>a strong spiritual belief.</p><p>Many tribes shared a similar one.</p><p>The Indians on the East Coast shared a highly developed system of trade.</p><p>Researchers say different tribes of Native Americans traded goods all across the country.</p><p>The first recorded meetings between Europeans and the natives of the East Coast took place in the 1500s.</p><p>Fishermen from France and the Basque area of Spain crossed the Atlantic Ocean.</p><p>They searched for whales along the east coast of North America.</p><p>They made temporary camps along the coast.</p><p>They often traded with the local Indians.</p><p>The Europeans often paid Indians to work for them.</p><p>Both groups found this to be a successful relationship.</p><p>Several times different groups of fishermen tried to establish a permanent settlement on the coast,</p><p>but the severe winters made it impossible.</p><p>These fishing camps were only temporary.</p><p>The first permanent settlers in New England began arriving in 1620.</p><p>They wanted to live in peace with the Indians.</p><p>They needed to trade with them for food.</p><p>The settlers also knew that a battle would result in their own,</p><p>quick defeat because they were so few in number.</p><p>Yet, problems began almost immediately.</p><p>Perhaps the most serious was the different way the American Indians and the Europeans thought about land.</p><p>This difference created problems that would not be solved during the next several hundred years.</p><p>Land was extremely important to the European settlers.</p><p>In England, and most other countries, land meant wealth.</p><p>Owning large amounts of land meant a person had great wealth and political power.</p><p>Many of the settlers in this new country could never have owned land in Europe.</p><p>They were too poor.</p><p>And they belonged to minority religious groups.</p><p>When they arrived in the new country,</p><p>they discovered no one seemed to own the huge amounts of land.</p><p>Companies in England needed to find people willing to settle in the new country.</p><p>So they offered land to anyone who would take the chance of crossing the Atlantic Ocean.</p><p>For many, it was a dream come true.</p><p>It was a way to improve their lives.</p><p>The land gave them a chance to become wealthy and powerful.</p><p>American Indians believed no person could own land.</p><p>They believed, however, that anyone could use it.</p><p>Anyone who wanted to live on and grow crops on a piece of land was able to do so.</p><p>The American Indians lived within nature.</p><p>They lived very well without working very hard.</p><p>They were able to do this because they understood the land and their environment.</p><p>They did not try to change the land.</p><p>They might farm in an area for a few years.</p><p>Then they would move on.</p><p>They permitted the land on which they had farmed to become wild again.</p><p>They might hunt on one area of land for some time,</p><p>but again they would move on.</p><p>They hunted only what they could eat,</p><p>so the numbers of animals continued to increase.</p><p>The Indians understood nature and made it work for them.</p><p>The first Europeans to settle in New England in the northeastern part of America were few in number.</p><p>They wanted land.</p><p>The Indians did not fear them.</p><p>There was enough land for everyone to use and plant crops.</p><p>It was easy to live together.</p><p>The Indians helped the settlers by teaching them how to plant crops and survive on the land.</p><p>But the Indians did not understand that the settlers were going to keep the land.</p><p>This idea was foreign to the Indians.</p><p>It was like to trying to own the air, or the clouds.</p><p>As the years passed, more and more settlers arrived,</p><p>and took more and more land.</p><p>They cut down trees.</p><p>They built fences to keep people and animals out.</p><p>They demanded that the Indians stay off their land.</p><p>Religion was another problem between the settlers and the Indians.</p><p>The settlers in New England were very serious about their Christian religion.</p><p>They thought it was the one true faith and all people should believe in it.</p><p>They soon learned that the Indians were not interested in learning about it or changing their beliefs.</p><p>Many settlers came to believe that Native Americans could not be trusted because they were not Christians.</p><p>The settler groups began to fear the Indians.</p><p>They thought of the Indians as a people who were evil because they had no religion.</p><p>The settlers told the Indians they must change and become Christians.</p><p>The Indians did not understand why they should change anything.</p><p>The European settlers failed to understand that </p><p>the Native American Indians were extremely religious people with a strong belief in unseen powers.</p><p>The Indians lived very close to nature.</p><p>They believed that all things in the universe depend on each other.</p><p>All native tribes had ceremonies that honored a creator of nature.</p><p>American Indians recognized the work of the creator of the world in their everyday life.</p><p>Other events also led to serious problems between the Native Americans and the settlers.</p><p>One serious problem was disease.</p><p>The settlers brought sickness with them from Europe.</p><p>For example, the disease smallpox was well known in Europe.</p><p>Some people carried the bacteria that caused smallpox,</p><p>although they did not suffer the sickness itself.</p><p>Smallpox was unknown to Native Americans.</p><p>Their bodies' defense systems could not fight against smallpox.</p><p>It killed whole tribes.</p><p>And, smallpox was only one such disease.</p><p>There were many others.</p><p>The first meetings between settlers and Native Americans were the same </p><p>in almost every European settlement on the East Coast of America.</p><p>The two groups met as friends.</p><p>They would begin by trading for food and other goods.</p><p>In time, however, something would happen to cause a crisis.</p><p>Perhaps a settler would demand that an Indian stay off the settler's land.</p><p>Perhaps a settler, or Indian, was killed.</p><p>Fear would replace friendship.</p><p>One side or the other would answer what they believed was an attack.</p><p>A good example of this is the violent clash called King Philip's War.</p><p>Matacom was a leader of the Wampanoag tribe that lived in the northern-most colonies.</p><p>He was known to the English as King Philip.</p><p>Without the help of his tribe,</p><p>the first European settlers in that area might not have survived their first winter.</p><p>The Wampanoag Indians provided them with food.</p><p>They taught the settlers how to plant corn and other food crops.</p><p>The two groups were very friendly for several years.</p><p>As the years passed, however, fear and a lack of understanding increased.</p><p>Matacom's brother died of a European disease.</p><p>Matacom blamed the settlers.</p><p>He also saw how the increasing numbers of settlers were changing the land.</p><p>He believed they were destroying it.</p><p>One small crisis after another led to the killing of a Christian Indian who lived with the settlers.</p><p>The settlers answered this by killing three Indians.</p><p>A war quickly followed.</p><p>It began in 1675 and continued for almost two years.</p><p>It was an extremely cruel war.</p><p>Men, women and children on both sides were killed.</p><p>Researchers believe more than six hundred settlers were killed.</p><p>They also say as many as three thousand Native Americans died in the violence.</p><p>History experts say the tribe of Indians called the Narraganset were the true victims of King Philip's War.</p><p>The Narraganset were not involved in the war.</p><p>They did not support one group or the other.</p><p>However, the settlers killed almost all the Narraganset Indians because they had learned to fear all Indians.</p><p>This fear, lack of understanding and the failure to compromise were not unusual.</p><p>They strongly influenced the European settlers relations with Native Americans in all areas of the new country.</p><p>This MAKING OF A NATION program was written and produced by Paul Thompson.</p><p>This is Ray Freeman.</p><p>And this is Rich Kleinfeldt.</p>
