<p>This is Sarah Long.</p><p>And this is Rich Kleinfeldt with THE MAKING OF A NATION, a VOA Special English program about the history of the United States.</p><p>Today, we tell about the start of the American colonies' war for independence from Britain in the late 1700s.</p><p>The road to revolution lasted several years.</p><p>The most serious events began in 1770.</p><p>War began five years later.</p><p>Relations between Britain and its American colonists were most tense in the colony of Massachusetts.</p><p>There were protests against the British policy of taxing the colonies without giving them representation in Parliament.</p><p>To prevent trouble, thousands of British soldiers were sent to Boston, the biggest city in Massachusetts.</p><p>On March 5, 1770, tension led to violence.</p><p>This is what happened.</p><p>It was the end of winter, and the weather was very cold.</p><p>A small group of colonists began throwing rocks and pieces of ice at soldiers guarding a public building.</p><p>They were joined by others, and the soldiers became frightened.</p><p>They fired their guns.</p><p>Five colonists were killed.</p><p>The incident became known as the Boston Massacre.</p><p>The people of Massachusetts were extremely angry.</p><p>The soldiers were tried in court for murder.</p><p>Most were found innocent.</p><p>The others received minor punishments.</p><p>Fearing more violence, the British Parliament cancelled most of its taxes.</p><p>Only the tax on tea remained.</p><p>This eased some of the tensions for a while.</p><p>Imports of British goods increased.</p><p>The colonists seemed satisfied with the situation, until a few years later.</p><p>That is when the Massachusetts colony once again became involved in a dispute with Britain.</p><p>The trouble started because the British government wanted to help improve the business of the British East India Company.</p><p>That company organized all the trade between India and other countries ruled by Britain.</p><p>By 1773, the company had become weak.</p><p>The British government decided to permit it to sell tea directly to the American colonies.</p><p>The colonies would still have to pay a tea tax to Britain.</p><p>The Americans did not like the new plan.</p><p>They felt they were being forced to buy their tea from only one company.</p><p>Officials in the colonies of Pennsylvania and New York sent the East India Company's ships back to Britain.</p><p>In Massachusetts, things were different.</p><p>The British governor there wanted to collect the tea tax and enforce the law.</p><p>When the ships arrived in Boston, some colonists tried to block their way.</p><p>The ships remained just outside the harbor without unloading their goods.</p><p>On the night of December sixteenth, 1773, a group of colonists went out in a small boat.</p><p>They got on a British ship and threw all the tea into the water.</p><p>The colonists were dressed as American Indians so the British would not recognize them, but the people of Boston knew who they were.</p><p>A crowd gathered to cheer them.</p><p>That incident -- the night when British tea was thrown into Boston harbor -- became known as the Boston Tea Party.</p><p>Destroying the tea was a serious crime.</p><p>The British government was angry.</p><p>Parliament reacted to the Boston Tea Party by punishing the whole colony of Massachusetts for the actions of a few men.</p><p>It approved a series of laws that once again changed relations between the colony and Britain.</p><p>One of these laws closed the port of Boston until the tea was paid for.</p><p>Other laws strengthened the power of the British governor and weakened the power of local colonial officials.</p><p>In June, 1774, the colony of Massachusetts called for a meeting of delegates from all the other colonies to consider joint action against Britain.</p><p>This meeting of colonial delegates was called the First Continental Congress.</p><p>It was held in the city of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, in September, 1774.</p><p>All the colonies except one was represented.</p><p>The southern colony of Georgia did not send a delegate.</p><p>The delegates agreed that the British Parliament had no right to control trade with the American colonies or to make any laws that affected them.</p><p>They said the people of the colonies must have the right to take part in any legislative group that made laws for them.</p><p>The First Continental Congress approved a series of documents that condemned all British actions in the American colonies after 1763.</p><p>It approved a Massachusetts proposal saying that the people could use weapons to defend their rights.</p><p>It also organized a Continental Association to boycott British goods and to stop all exports to any British colony or to Britain itself.</p><p>Local committees were created to enforce the boycott.</p><p>One of the delegates to this First Continental Congress was John Adams of Massachusetts.</p><p>Many years later, he said that by the time the meeting was held, the American Revolution had already begun.</p><p>Britain's King George the Second announced that the New England colonies were in rebellion.</p><p>Parliament made the decision to use troops against Massachusetts in January, 1775.</p><p>The people of Massachusetts formed a provincial assembly and began training men to fight.</p><p>Soon, groups of armed men were doing military exercises in towns all around Massachusetts and in other colonies, too.</p><p>British officers received their orders in April, 1775.</p><p>By that time, the colonists had been gathering weapons in the town of Concord, about thirty kilometers west of Boston.</p><p>The British forces were ordered to seize the weapons.</p><p>But the colonists knew they were coming and were prepared.</p><p>Years later, Henry Wadsworth Longfellow wrote a poem about what happened.</p><p>The poem tells about the actions of Paul Revere, one of three men who helped warn the colonial troops that the British were coming:</p><p>Listen my children and you shall hear</p><p>Of the midnight ride of Paul Revere.</p><p>On the eighteenth of April in Seventy-five</p><p>Hardly a man is now alive</p><p>Who remembers that famous day and year.</p><p>He said to his friend, "If the British march</p><p>By land or sea from the town tonight</p><p>Hang a lantern aloft in the belfry arch</p><p>Of the North Church tower as a signal light, --</p><p>One if by land, and two if by sea;</p><p>And I on the opposite shore will be,</p><p>Ready to ride and spread the alarm</p><p>Through every Middlesex village and farm</p><p>For the country folk to be up and to arm."</p><p>When the British reached the town of Lexington, they found it protected by about seventy colonial troops.</p><p>These troops were called "Minute Men" because they had been trained to fight with only a minute's warning.</p><p>Guns were fired.</p><p>Eight colonists were killed.</p><p>No one knows who fired the first shot in that first battle of the American Revolution.</p><p>Each side accused the other.</p><p>But the meaning was very clear.</p><p>It was called "the shot heard round the world."</p><p>From Lexington, the British marched to Concord, where they destroyed whatever supplies the colonists had not been able to save.</p><p>Other colonial troops rushed to the area.</p><p>A battle at Concord's north bridge forced the British to march back to Boston.</p><p>It was the first day of America's war for independence.</p><p>When it was over, almost three hundred British troops had been killed.</p><p>Fewer than one hundred Americans had died.</p><p>The British troops had marched in time with their drummers and pipers.</p><p>The musicians had played a song called "Yankee Doodle."  The British invented the song to insult the Americans.</p><p>They said a Yankee Doodle was a man who did not know how to fight.</p><p>After the early battles of the revolution, the Americans said they were glad to be Yankee Doodles.</p><p>Following the battles at Lexington and Concord, the Massachusetts government organized a group that captured Fort Ticonderoga on Lake Champlain in New York State.</p><p>The other colonies began sending troops to help.</p><p>And another joint colonial meeting was called:  the Second Continental Congress.</p><p>That will be our story next week.</p><p>Today's MAKING OF A NATION program was written by Nancy Steinbach.</p><p>This is Sarah Long.</p><p>And this is Rich Kleinfeldt.</p>
