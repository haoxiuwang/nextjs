<p>This is THE MAKING OF A NATION in VOA Special English.</p><p>I'm Steve Ember.</p><p>And I'm Barbara Klein.</p><p>This week, we tell about the conflicts among the nations in Europe during the 18th century and how they affected North America.</p><p>During the 18th century, Spain, France and Britain controlled land in North America.</p><p>Spain controlled Florida.</p><p>France was powerful in the northern and central areas.</p><p>Britain controlled the east.</p><p>All three nations knew they could not exist together peacefully in North America.</p><p>The situation could only be settled by war.</p><p>The powerful European nations already were fighting each other for land and money all over the world.</p><p>These small wars continued for more than one hundred years.</p><p>They were called King William's War, Queen Anne's War, King George's War and the French and Indian War.</p><p>The French and Indian War was fought to decide if Britain or France would be the strong power in North America.</p><p>France and its colonists and Indian allies fought against Britain, its colonists and Indian allies.</p><p>The war began with conflicts about land.</p><p>French explorers had been the first Europeans in the areas around the Great Lakes and the Ohio and Mississippi rivers.</p><p>France had sent traders and trappers to these territories and had established trading centers there.</p><p>Britain claimed the same land.</p><p>When the king gave land in North America to someone, </p><p>the land was considered to extend from east coast to west coast, </p><p>even though no one knew where the west coast was.</p><p>The land along the east coast had become crowded, and settlers were moving west.</p><p>White people were destroying the Indians' hunting areas.</p><p>And Indians became worried that they would lose the use of their land.</p><p>The Indian tribes may have been able to resist the people moving west if they had been united.</p><p>But their own conflicts kept the Indian groups apart.</p><p>When Britain and France started fighting each other, some Indians helped the British.</p><p>Others helped the French.</p><p>The French settlers lived mainly in what was called New France.</p><p>Today it is part of Canada.</p><p>Life there was different from life in the British colonies to the south.</p><p>There was no religious freedom, for example.</p><p>All settlers in French territories had to be French and belong to the Roman Catholic Church.</p><p>So, many French people who belonged to Protestant churches settled in the British colonies.</p><p>France also did not like the fact that the British paid the Indians high prices for animal furs.</p><p>France was more interested in the fur trade than in settling the land.</p><p>The British hurt the French traders' business when they bought fur from the Indians.</p><p>One of the French trading forts was built in the area where the city of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania is today.</p><p>The French called it Fort Duquesne.</p><p>The British claimed it was in Virginia and that the land belonged to them.</p><p>In 1754, the governor of Virginia sent a twenty-one-year-old colonist named George Washington to tell the French to get out.</p><p>This was the same George Washington who would later become the first President of the United States.</p><p>The French refused to leave Fort Duquesne.</p><p>So Washington and one hundred fifty men tried to force them out.</p><p>They attacked a group of Frenchmen and killed ten of them.</p><p>The French and Indian War had begun.</p><p>British troops under the command of General Edward Braddock joined George Washington at Fort Duquesne.</p><p>The British general expected to fight the way battles were fought in Europe.</p><p>There, troops lined up on open fields and fired their weapons as they marched toward each other.</p><p>The French and Indians did not fight this way.</p><p>They hid in the woods.</p><p>They wore clothes that made them difficult to see.</p><p>They shot at the British from behind trees.</p><p>The British had more troops than the other side.</p><p>But the French and Indians won the battle of Fort Duquesne.</p><p>General Braddock was killed.</p><p>Most of the French and Indian War was fought along two lakes in an area of New York state near the border with Canada.</p><p>One was Lake George.</p><p>The other, Lake Champlain north of Lake George.</p><p>It reaches almost all the way to the city of Montreal in Canada.</p><p>These lakes provided the best way to move troops and supplies during the French and Indian war.</p><p>Few roads existed in North America at that time.</p><p>The military force, which controlled the lakes and rivers, controlled much of North America.</p><p>The French had military bases in the cities of Quebec and Montreal.</p><p>The British had military bases along New York's Hudson River.</p><p>The area between them became the great battleground.</p><p>Fighting increased after the British defeated the French near Lake George in the last months of 1755 </p><p>The French then built a new military base to control Lake Champlain and the surrounding area.</p><p>The French military base was at the southern end of Lake Champlain.</p><p>They built a strong camp, the kind called a fort.</p><p> They called it Fort Carillon.</p><p>The fort would control Lake Champlain and the area needed to reach the northern part of Lake George.</p><p>The fort was designed to provide a strong defense against attack.</p><p>The French built two big walls of logs, several meters apart.</p><p>The area between the walls was filled with dirt.</p><p>Later, a strong stone front was added.</p><p>Troops inside the walls were well protected.</p><p>The British built a similar fort at the southern end of Lake George.</p><p>They called it Fort William Henry.</p><p>France sent one of its best military commanders to take command of its troops in America.</p><p>His name was the Marquis de Montcalm.</p><p>General Montcalm attacked several British forts in 1757.</p><p>One of these was Fort William Henry on Lake George.</p><p>The British commander was forced to surrender.</p><p>General Montcalm promised that the British troops would be treated fairly if they surrendered.</p><p>But the Indian allies of the French did not honor the surrender agreement.</p><p>They began to kill British soldiers and settlers.</p><p>No one is sure how many people died.</p><p>It could have been more than one thousand.</p><p>In 1758, a strong British force attacked Fort Carillon on Lake Champlain.</p><p>General Montcalm was the French commander.</p><p>Fort Carillon was strong enough that the smaller French force was able to defeat the bigger British force.</p><p>The British withdrew, but attacked again the next year.</p><p>This time the British commander was General Jeffery Amherst.</p><p>Amherst was successful.</p><p>The British defeated the French.</p><p>They changed the name of Fort Carillon to Fort Ticonderoga.</p><p>It became an important military center in the French and Indian War.</p><p>Fort Ticonderoga would also become important later, during America's war for independence.</p><p>The Battle for Quebec was the turning point in the war.</p><p> Britain and France signed a treaty to end it in Paris in 1763.</p><p>The British had won.</p><p>They took control of the lands that had been claimed by France.</p><p>Britain now claimed all the land from the east coast of North America to the Mississippi River.</p><p>Everything west of that river belonged to Spain.</p><p>France gave all its western lands to Spain to keep the British out.</p><p>Indians still controlled most of the western lands, except for some Spanish colonies in Texas and New Mexico.</p><p>Today, you can still visit the two forts that were so important in the French and Indian War.</p><p>Little of the original buildings have survived.</p><p>However, both have been re-built using the original designs.</p><p>The area surrounding both forts is very beautiful, including the two lakes, Lake George and Lake Champlain.</p><p>Many people spend their holidays in this area enjoying the outdoors.</p><p>The area includes one of America's national historical parks, Saratoga.</p><p>It also includes the Lake George Beach State Park.</p><p>Few people who visit the area stop to remember the terrible fighting that took place there two-hundred fifty years ago.</p><p>This MAKING OF A NATION program was written by Nancy Steinbach and Paul Thompson.</p><p>I'm Barbara
