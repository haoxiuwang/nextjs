<p>his is Rich Kleinfeldt.</p><p></p><p>And this is Sarah Long with THE MAKING OF A NATION,</p><p></p><p>a VOA Special English program</p><p></p><p>about the history of the United States.</p><p></p><p>Today, we tell about</p><p></p><p>the first permanent English settlements</p><p></p><p>in North America.</p><p></p><p>England was the first country</p><p></p><p>to compete with Spain</p><p></p><p>for claims in the New World,</p><p></p><p>although it was too weak</p><p></p><p>to do this openly at first.</p><p></p><p>But Queen Elizabeth of England</p><p></p><p>supported such explorations</p><p></p><p>as early as the 1570s.</p><p></p><p>Sir Humphrey Gilbert</p><p></p><p>led the first English settlement efforts.</p><p></p><p>He did not establish</p><p></p><p>any lasting settlement.</p><p></p><p>He died</p><p></p><p>as he was returning to England.</p><p></p><p>Gilbert's half brother Sir Walter Raleigh</p><p></p><p>continued his work.</p><p></p><p>Raleigh sent a number of ships</p><p></p><p>to explore the east coast of North America.</p><p></p><p>He called the land Virginia</p><p></p><p>to honor England's</p><p></p><p>unmarried Queen Elizabeth.</p><p></p><p>In 1585, about one-hundred men</p><p></p><p>settled on Roanoke Island,</p><p></p><p>off the coast of the present day state</p><p></p><p>of North Carolina.</p><p></p><p>These settlers returned to England a year later.</p><p></p><p>Another group went to Roanoke the next year.</p><p></p><p>This group included</p><p></p><p>a number of women and children.</p><p></p><p>But the supply ships Raleigh sent</p><p></p><p>to the colony failed to arrive.</p><p></p><p>When help got there in 1590,</p><p></p><p>none of the settlers could be found.</p><p></p><p>History experts still are not sure what happened.</p><p></p><p>Some research suggests that</p><p></p><p>at least some of the settlers</p><p></p><p>became part of the Indian tribe</p><p></p><p>that lived in the area.</p><p></p><p>One reason for the delay</p><p></p><p>in getting supplies to Roanoke</p><p></p><p>was the attack of the Spanish Navy</p><p></p><p>against England in 1588.</p><p></p><p>King Phillip of Spain had decided</p><p></p><p>to invade England.</p><p></p><p>But the small English ships</p><p></p><p>combined with a fierce storm</p><p></p><p>defeated the huge Spanish fleet.</p><p></p><p>As a result,</p><p></p><p>Spain was no longer able to</p><p></p><p>block English exploration.</p><p></p><p>England discovered that</p><p></p><p>supporting colonies so far away</p><p></p><p>was extremely costly.</p><p></p><p>So Queen Elizabeth took no more action to do this.</p><p></p><p>It was not until after her death in 1603</p><p></p><p>that England began serious efforts</p><p></p><p>to start colonies in America.</p><p></p><p>In 1606, the new English King,</p><p></p><p>James the First,</p><p></p><p>gave two business groups permission</p><p></p><p>to establish colonies in Virginia,</p><p></p><p>the area claimed by England.</p><p></p><p>Companies were organized</p><p></p><p>to carry out the move.</p><p></p><p>The London Company sent</p><p></p><p>one hundred settlers to Virginia in 1606.</p><p></p><p>The group landed there in May, 1607</p><p></p><p>and founded Jamestown.</p><p></p><p>It was the first permanent English colony</p><p></p><p>in the new world.</p><p></p><p>The colony seemed about to</p><p></p><p>fail from the start.</p><p></p><p>The settlers did not plant their crops in time</p><p></p><p>so they soon had no food.</p><p></p><p>Their leaders lacked the farming and building skills</p><p></p><p>needed to survive on the land.</p><p></p><p>More than half the settlers died</p><p></p><p>during the first winter.</p><p></p><p>The businessmen controlling the colony from London knew</p><p></p><p>nothing about living in such a wild place.</p><p></p><p>They wanted the settlers</p><p></p><p>to search for gold,</p><p></p><p>and explore local rivers</p><p></p><p>in hopes of finding a way to the East.</p><p></p><p>One settler knew this was wrong.</p><p></p><p>His name was Captain John Smith.</p><p></p><p>He helped the colonists</p><p></p><p>build houses and grow food</p><p></p><p>by learning from the local Indians.</p><p></p><p>Still, the Jamestown settlers continued to die each year</p><p></p><p>from disease, lack of food and Indian attacks.</p><p></p><p>The London Company sent six thousand settlers</p><p></p><p>to Virginia between 1606 and 1622.</p><p></p><p>More than four thousand died during that time.</p><p></p><p>History experts say that</p><p></p><p>all the settlers surely would have died</p><p></p><p>without the help of the local Powhatan Indians.</p><p></p><p>The Indians gave the settlers food.</p><p></p><p>They taught them how to live in the forest.</p><p></p><p>And the Powhatan Indians showed the settlers</p><p></p><p>how to plant new crops</p><p></p><p>and how to clear the land for building.</p><p></p><p>The settlers accepted the Indians' help.</p><p></p><p>Then, however, the settlers took whatever else</p><p></p><p>they wanted by force.</p><p></p><p>In 1622, the local Indians attacked the settlers</p><p></p><p>for interfering with Indian land.</p><p></p><p>Three hundred forty settlers died.</p><p></p><p>The colonists answered the attack</p><p></p><p>by destroying the Indian tribes</p><p></p><p>living along Virginia's coast.</p><p></p><p>The settlers recognized that</p><p></p><p>they would have to grow their own food</p><p></p><p>and survive on their own</p><p></p><p>without help from England or anyone else.</p><p></p><p>The Jamestown colony was clearly established by 1624.</p><p></p><p>It was even beginning to earn money</p><p></p><p>by growing and selling a new crop, tobacco.</p><p></p><p>The other early English settlements in North America</p><p></p><p>were much to the north of Virginia,</p><p></p><p>in the present state of Massachusetts.</p><p></p><p>The people who settled there </p><p></p><p>left England for different reasons than those </p><p></p><p>who settled in Jamestown.</p><p></p><p>The Virginia settlers were looking for ways </p><p></p><p>to earn money for English businesses.</p><p></p><p>The settlers in Massachusetts were seeking religious freedom.</p><p></p><p>King Henry the Eighth of England </p><p></p><p>had separated from the Roman Catholic Church.</p><p></p><p>His daughter, Queen Elizabeth, </p><p></p><p>established the Protestant religion in England.</p><p></p><p>It was called the Church of England, </p><p></p><p>or the Anglican Church.</p><p></p><p>The Anglican Church, however, </p><p></p><p>was similar to that of the Roman Catholic Church.</p><p></p><p>Not all Protestants liked this.</p><p></p><p>Some wanted to leave the Anglican Church </p><p></p><p>and form religious groups of their own.</p><p></p><p>In 1606, members of one such group in the town of Scrooby </p><p></p><p>did separate from the Anglican Church.</p><p></p><p>About one hundred twenty-five people </p><p></p><p>left England for Holland.</p><p></p><p>They found problems there too, </p><p></p><p>so they decided to move again to the New World.</p><p></p><p>These people were called pilgrims, </p><p></p><p>because that is the name given </p><p></p><p>to people who travel for religious purposes.</p><p></p><p>About thirty-five pilgrims were among the passengers </p><p></p><p>on a ship called the Mayflower in 1620.</p><p></p><p>It left England to go to Virginia.</p><p></p><p>But the Mayflower never reached Virginia.</p><p></p><p>Instead, it landed to the north, on Cape Cod Bay.</p><p></p><p>The group decided to stay there </p><p></p><p>instead of trying to find Jamestown.</p><p></p><p>The pilgrims and the others on the Mayflower </p><p></p><p>saw a need for rules </p><p></p><p>that would help them live together peacefully.</p><p></p><p>They believed they were not under English control </p><p></p><p>since they did not land in Virginia.</p><p></p><p>So they wrote a plan of government, </p><p></p><p>called the Mayflower Compact.</p><p></p><p>It was the first such plan </p><p></p><p>ever developed in the New World.</p><p></p><p>They elected a man called William Bradford </p><p></p><p>as the first governor of their Plymouth Colony.</p><p></p><p>We know about the first thirty years of the Plymouth Colony </p><p></p><p>because William Bradford described it </p><p></p><p>in his book, Of Plymouth Plantation.</p><p></p><p>As happened in Jamestown, </p><p></p><p>about half the settlers in Plymouth </p><p></p><p>died the first winter.</p><p></p><p>The survivors were surprised </p><p></p><p>to find an Indian who spoke English.</p><p></p><p>His name was Squanto.</p><p></p><p>He had been kidnapped by an English sea captain </p><p></p><p>and had lived in England </p><p></p><p>before returning to his people.</p><p></p><p>The Pilgrims believed </p><p></p><p>Squanto was sent to them from God.</p><p></p><p>He made it possible for them </p><p></p><p>to communicate with the native people.</p><p></p><p>He showed them the best places to fish, </p><p></p><p>what kind of crops to plant and how to grow them.</p><p></p><p>He provided them with all kinds of information </p><p></p><p>they needed to survive.</p><p></p><p>The settlers invited the Indians to a feast </p><p></p><p>in the month of November to celebrate their successes </p><p></p><p>and to thank Squanto for his help.</p><p></p><p>Americans remember that celebration every year </p><p></p><p>when they observe the Thanksgiving holiday.</p><p></p><p>Other English settlers began arriving </p><p></p><p>in the area now called New England.</p><p></p><p>One large group was called the Puritans.</p><p></p><p>Like the pilgrims, the Puritans did not agree </p><p></p><p>with the Anglican Church.</p><p></p><p>But they did not want to separate from it.</p><p></p><p>The Puritans wanted to change it </p><p></p><p>to make it more holy.</p><p></p><p>Their desire for this change made them unwelcome in England.</p><p></p><p>The first ship carrying Puritans </p><p></p><p>left England for America in 1630.</p><p></p><p>By the end of that summer, </p><p></p><p>one thousand Puritans had landed </p><p></p><p>in the northeastern part of the new country.</p><p></p><p>The new English King, Charles, </p><p></p><p>had given permission for them </p><p></p><p>to settle the Massachusetts Bay area.</p><p></p><p>The Puritans began leaving England in large groups.</p><p></p><p>Between 1630 and 1640, </p><p></p><p>20,000 sailed for New England.</p><p></p><p>They risked their lives on the dangerous trip.</p><p></p><p>They wanted to live among people </p><p></p><p>who believed as they did, </p><p></p><p>people who honored the rules of the Bible.</p><p></p><p>Puritans believed that the Bible was the word of God.</p><p></p><p>The Puritans and other Europeans, however, </p><p></p><p>found a very different people in the New World.</p><p></p><p>They were America's native Indians.</p><p></p><p>That will be our story next week.</p><p></p><p>This MAKING OF A NATION program was written by Nancy Steinbach.</p><p></p><p>This is Rich Kleinfeldt And this is Sarah
