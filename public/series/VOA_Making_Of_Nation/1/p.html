<p>Welcome to THE MAKING OF A NATION â€“ American history in VOA Special English.</p><p>I'm Shirley Griffith.</p><p>And I'm Steve Ember.</p><p>Today history repeats itself.</p><p>We start our series over again.</p><p>The last time we were at the beginning was in February of 2003.</p><p>THE MAKING OF A NATION has a loyal following.</p><p>In fact, listener research finds it the most popular weekly program in VOA Special English.</p><p>It started in May of 1969.</p><p>Some people can remember when THE MAKING OF A NATION was on the radio two times a week.</p><p>People who grew up listening to it are old enough now to listen with their own children, or even their grandchildren.</p><p>The series tells a story.</p><p>You can think of it not just as a series of programs about the history of America and its people, but a series of lessons.</p><p>The subjects include exploration, revolution, civil war, social and political change, the rise of industry and modern technology, and more.</p><p>We ended last week at program number two hundred thirty-eight.</p><p>The subject was the presidential election of 2004.</p><p>As time adds to the story, we add new programs to the series.</p><p>In a sense, THE MAKING OF A NATION is a living history.</p><p>Yet some of the announcers are no longer even alive after all these years.</p><p>Here and there, too, the language may sound a little dated.</p><p>For example, some of the programs call black people Negroes.</p><p>The use of that term may be historically correct, but today the socially accepted name is African-American.</p><p>Technology has also changed.</p><p>Today THE MAKING OF A NATION is not just on radio but also on the Internet.</p><p>At voaspecialenglish.com, you can download MP3 files and transcripts.</p><p>That way you can listen anytime or anyplace -- and read along.</p><p>The site also includes archives, in case you ever miss a program.</p><p>So how was the nation made? Why did loyal citizens rebel against one nation and start their own, with different laws? </p><p>THE MAKING OF A NATION answers these and other questions about American history.</p><p>We tell the story of how a group of farmers, businessmen and lawyers wrote a document they called the Constitution of the United States.</p><p>On September seventeenth, 1787, delegates to the Constitutional Convention in Philadelphia met one last time to sign it.</p><p>We explain why that document is still extremely important today -- and not just to Americans.</p><p>Other governments have used it as a guide to creating a modern democracy.</p><p>We explore why the writers of the Constitution included guarantees of freedom of speech and religion, and the right to a fair and public trial.</p><p>We also talk about the reasons for the American Revolution.</p><p>One of the most important was the idea that citizens of a country should have a voice in its decisions.</p><p>British citizens in the American colonies paid taxes but had no representatives in the British Parliament.</p><p>Taxation without representation led to growing anger in the American colonies.</p><p>The leaders of the revolt made important changes.</p><p>They decided that any free citizen could be a candidate for public office.</p><p>And they made sure that all free men who owned land and paid taxes were permitted to vote.</p><p>Not until 1920 did the Constitution give women the right to vote.</p><p>Later, another change lowered the voting age for Americans from 21 to 18.</p><p>Our programs explain the thinking behind these and other rights.</p><p>They also tell the story of each presidential election and presidency in American history.</p><p>THE MAKING OF A NATION explores the good and the bad in American history.</p><p>For example, how could slavery exist in a nation whose people declared that "all men are created equal" and with a right to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness?</p><p>Many programs tell about the ideas and issues that have shaped the United States.</p><p>But most importantly, they tell about the people.</p><p>For example, George Washington was a farmer before he became a military commander.</p><p>He became president because the citizens of the new country wanted him as their first leader.</p><p>After two terms, he gave up power by his own choice.</p><p>He once again became a farmer and a private citizen.</p><p>In his farewell address in 1796, he warned Americans about the dangers of political parties.</p><p>Thomas Jefferson wrote the Declaration of Independence.</p><p>It told the world that the people of this new country would no longer answer to a European ruler.</p><p>Some of the people who formed the United States into a nation during the 1700s were well educated and wealthy.</p><p>Abraham Lincoln was not.</p><p>Still, he grew up to become president.</p><p>Abraham Lincoln became president during the 1860s when several southern states decided they no longer wanted to be part of the United States.</p><p>We tell how President Lincoln dealt with the terrible Civil War that almost split the country apart.</p><p>One of our programs deals with a speech he gave in the little town of Gettysburg, Pennsylvania.</p><p>A great battle had been fought there.</p><p>President Lincoln had been asked to come to Gettysburg to say a few words at the dedication of a military burial place.</p><p>The speech was short.</p><p>President Lincoln honored the young men who had died on that bloody battlefield.</p><p>He also told the world why the terrible war was being fought and why it was so important.</p><p>"Four score and seven years ago, our fathers brought forth on this continent a new nation, conceived in liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal."</p><p>Those words were just the first sentence.</p><p>After President Lincoln wrote the speech, he felt sad.</p><p>He considered it a failure.</p><p>In fact, his words earned the respect of history.</p><p>You can hear the full Gettysburg Address in our programs about the life and presidency of Abraham Lincoln.</p><p>THE MAKING OF A NATION touches on many different subjects.</p><p>One of them is social change.</p><p>For example, we tell about the changes that took place in the 1920s, known as the Roaring Twenties.</p><p>Many young people decided they no longer needed to follow the conservative traditions of their parents and grandparents.</p><p>This was the age of jazz.</p><p>But music and social values were not the only things changing.</p><p>The Roaring Twenties were also a time of fast-moving economic change.</p><p>Productivity grew sharply.</p><p>At the same time, the divide between rich and poor Americans grew wider.</p><p>By the end of the Roaring Twenties, the economy was ready to collapse.</p><p>Then, in October of 1929, the stock market crashed.</p><p>What followed was an economic disaster worse than any the modern world has ever known.</p><p>We examine the causes of the Great Depression and how it affected Americans and the rest of the world.</p><p>We tell the story of people who lost their jobs, their homes and their hope for the future.</p><p>Franklin Roosevelt was elected with a promise to bring the country out of the Depression.</p><p>On March fourth, 1933, he was inaugurated to his first of four terms.</p><p>He served longer than any other president in American history.</p><p>We discuss Roosevelt's New Deal programs and his leadership during World War Two.</p><p>But not all of the subjects on THE MAKING OF A NATION are so serious.</p><p>We also look at the history of American popular culture and subjects like the rise of high technology.</p><p>Something for everyone.</p><p>Today's news is not only tomorrow's history, it will also become part of THE MAKING OF A NATION.</p><p>But for now, we start again from the beginning.</p><p>I'm Shirley Griffith.</p><p>And I'm Steve Ember.</p><p>Join us at this time next week and every week as we go back in time.</p>
