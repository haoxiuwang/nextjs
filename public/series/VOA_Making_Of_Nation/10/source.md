Today, we tell about relations between the American colonies and Britain after the French and Indian War about two hundred fifty years ago.
今天，我们讲述大约250年前法国和印第安人战争之后美国殖民地和英国之间的关系。
The French and Indian War was one part of a world conflict between Britain and France.
法国和印第安人的战争是英国和法国之间世界冲突的一部分。

Britain now was responsible for almost two million people in the thirteen American colonies and sixty thousand French-speaking people in Canada.
英国现在在13个美洲殖民地有近200万人口，在加拿大有6万讲法语的人口。

The colonists in America in 1763 were very different from those who had settled there more than one hundred years before.

They had different ideas.
他们有不同的想法。
They had come to consider their colonial legislatures as smaller but similar to the Parliament in Britain.

The colonists began to feel that their legislatures should also have the powers that the British Parliament had.

The situation had changed in England too.
英国的情况也发生了变化。
In 1707, the nation became officially known as Great Britain.

It was the legislature that decided major questions by the time of the French and Indian War, especially the power to tax.

History experts say the main reason the colonists were angry was because Britain had rejected the idea of "no taxation without representation."
