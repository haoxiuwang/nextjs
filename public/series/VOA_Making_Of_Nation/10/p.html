<p>This is Rich Kleinfeldt.</p><p>And this is Sarah Long with THE MAKING OF A NATION, A VOA Special English program about the history of the United States.</p><p>Today, we tell about relations between the American colonies and Britain after the French and Indian War about two hundred fifty years ago.</p><p>The French and Indian War was one part of a world conflict between Britain and France.</p><p>It was fought to decide which of the two powerful nations would rule North America.</p><p>The British defeated the French in North America in 1763.</p><p>As a result, it took control of lands that had been claimed by France.</p><p>Britain now was responsible for almost two million people in the thirteen American colonies and sixty thousand French-speaking people in Canada.</p><p>In addition to political and economic responsibilities, </p><p>Britain had to protect all these colonists from different groups of Indians.</p><p>This would cost a lot of money.</p><p>Britain already had spent a lot of money sending troops and material to the colonies to fight the French and Indian War.</p><p>It believed the American colonists should now help pay for that war.</p><p>The colonists in America in 1763 were very different from those who had settled there more than one hundred years before.</p><p>They had different ideas.</p><p>They had come to consider their colonial legislatures as smaller but similar to the Parliament in Britain.</p><p>These little parliaments had helped them rule themselves for more than one hundred years.</p><p>The colonists began to feel that their legislatures should also have the powers that the British Parliament had.</p><p>The situation had changed in England too.</p><p>In 1707, the nation became officially known as Great Britain.</p><p>Its king no longer controlled Parliament as he had in the early 1600s.</p><p>Then, the king decided all major questions, especially those concerning the colonies.</p><p>But power had moved from the king to the Parliament.</p><p>It was the legislature that decided major questions by the time of the French and Indian War, especially the power to tax.</p><p>The parliaments in the colonies began to believe that they should have this power of taxation, too.</p><p>The first English settlers in America considered themselves citizens of England.</p><p>They had crossed a dangerous ocean to create a little England in a new place, </p><p>to trade with the mother country and to spread their religion.</p><p>By 1763, however, the colonists thought of themselves as Americans.</p><p>Many of their families had been in North America for fifty to one hundred years.</p><p>They had cleared the land, built homes, fought Indians and made lives for themselves far away from Britain.</p><p>They had different everyday concerns than the people in Britain.</p><p>Their way of life was different, too.</p><p>They did not want anyone else to tell them how to govern themselves.</p><p>The British, however, still believed that the purpose of a colony was to serve the mother country.</p><p>The government treated colonists differently from citizens at home.</p><p>It demanded special taxes from them.</p><p>It also ordered them to feed British troops and let them live in their houses.</p><p>Britain claimed that the soldiers were in the colonies to protect the people.</p><p>The people asked, "From whom?"</p><p>As long as the French were nearby in Canada, the colonists needed the protection of the British army and navy.</p><p>After the French were gone </p><p>following their defeat in the French and Indian War  </p><p>the colonists felt they no longer needed British military protection.</p><p>The British government demanded that the colonists pay higher and higher taxes.</p><p>One reason was that the British government wanted to show the colonists that it was in control.</p><p>Another reason was that Britain was having money problems.</p><p>Foreign wars had left it with big debts.</p><p>The British thought the colonists should help pay some of these debts, </p><p>especially those resulting from the French and Indian War.</p><p>The American colonists might have agreed, but they wanted to have a say in the decision.</p><p>They wanted the right to vote about their own taxes, like the people living in Britain.</p><p>But no colonists were permitted to serve in the British Parliament.</p><p>So they protested that they were being taxed without being represented.</p><p>In 1764, the British Parliament approved the Sugar Act.</p><p>This legislation placed taxes on sugar, coffee, wines and other products imported to America in large amounts.</p><p>It increased by two times the taxes on European products sent to the colonies through Britain.</p><p>The British government also approved new measures aimed at enforcing all trade laws.</p><p>And it decided to restrict the printing of paper money in the colonies.</p><p>The American colonists opposed all these new laws.</p><p>Yet they could not agree about how to resist.</p><p>Colonial assemblies approved protests against the laws, but the protest actions were all different and had no real effect.</p><p>Business groups tried to organize boycotts of goods.</p><p>But these were not very successful...until the British government approved another tax in 1765: a tax on stamps.</p><p>The Stamp Act probably angered more American colonists than any earlier tax.</p><p>It said the colonists had to buy a British stamp for every piece of printed paper they used.</p><p>That meant they would be taxed for every piece of a newspaper, every document, even every playing card.</p><p>The colonists refused to pay.</p><p>Colonial assemblies approved resolutions suggesting that the British Parliament had no right to tax the colonies at all.</p><p>Some colonists were so angry that they attacked British stamp agents.</p><p>History experts say the main reason the colonists were angry was because Britain had rejected the idea of "no taxation without representation."  </p><p>Almost no colonist wanted to be independent of Britain at that time.</p><p>Yet all of them valued their local self-rule and their rights as British citizens.</p><p>They considered the Stamp Act to be the worst in a series of violations of these rights.</p><p>The American colonists refused to obey the Stamp Act.</p><p>They also refused to buy British goods.</p><p>Almost one thousand storeowners signed non-importation agreements.</p><p>This cost British businessmen so much money that they demanded that the government end the Stamp Act.</p><p>Parliament finally cancelled the law in 1766.</p><p>The colonists immediately ended their ban against British goods.</p><p>The same day that Parliament cancelled the Stamp Act, however, it approved the Declaratory Act.</p><p>This was a statement saying the colonies existed to serve Britain, and that Britain could approve any law it wanted.</p><p>Most American colonists considered this statement to be illegal.</p><p>History experts say this shows how separated the colonies had become from Britain.</p><p>Colonial assemblies were able to approve their own laws, but only with the permission of the British Parliament.</p><p>The colonists, however, considered the work of their assemblies as their own form of self-rule.</p><p>Britain ended the Stamp Act but did not stop demanding taxes.</p><p>In 1767, Parliament approved a series of new taxes called the Townshend Acts.</p><p>These were named after the government official who proposed them.</p><p>The Townshend Acts placed taxes on glass, tea, lead, paints and paper imported into the colonies.</p><p>The American colonists rejected the Townshend Acts and started a new boycott of British goods.</p><p>They also made efforts to increase manufacturing in the colonies.</p><p>By the end of 1769, they had reduced by half the amount of goods imported from Britain.</p><p>The colonies also began to communicate with each other about their problems.</p><p>In 1768, the Massachusetts General Court sent a letter to the legislatures of the other colonies.</p><p>It said the Townshend Acts violated the colonists' natural and constitutional rights.</p><p>When news of the letter reached London, British officials ordered the colonial governor of Massachusetts to dismiss the legislature.</p><p>Then they moved four thousand British troops into Boston, the biggest city in Massachusetts </p><p>and the biggest city in the American colonies.</p><p>The people of Boston hated the British soldiers.</p><p>The soldiers were controlling their streets and living in their houses.</p><p>This tension led to violence.</p><p>That will be our story next week.</p><p>Today's MAKING OF A NATION program was written by Nancy Steinbach.</p><p>This is Sarah Long.</p><p>And this is Rich Kleinfeldt.</p>
