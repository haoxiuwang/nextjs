If anything had been needed to give an impetus to Jack McMurdo's popularity among his fellows it would have been his arrest and acquittal. That a man on the very night of joining the lodge should have done something which brought him before the magistrate was a new record in the annals of the society. Already he had earned the reputation of a good boon companion, a cheery reveller, and withal a man of high temper, who would not take an insult even from the all-powerful Boss himself. But in addition to this he impressed his comrades with the idea that among them all there was not one whose brain was so ready to devise a bloodthirsty scheme, or whose hand would be more capable of carrying it out. “He'll be the boy for the clean job,” said the oldsters to one another, and waited their time until they could set him to his work.

如果说有什么能推动杰克 · 麦克默多在同事中的声望的话，那就是他的被捕和无罪释放。一个人在参加会议的那个晚上，竟然做了一件事，把他带到法官面前，这在社会史上是一个新的记录。他已经赢得了一个好伙伴的名声，一个愉快的狂欢者，和一个脾气很大的人，谁不会受到侮辱，甚至从全能的老板自己。但是除此之外，他还给他的同志们留下了深刻的印象: 在他们所有人中，没有一个人的大脑如此愿意设计一个嗜血的计划，也没有一个人的手能够更好地执行这个计划。“他将是那个干净活的男孩,”老人们彼此说，等待着时机，直到他们可以安排他做他的工作。

McGinty had instruments enough already; but he recognized that this was a supremely able one. He felt like a man holding a fierce bloodhound in leash. There were curs to do the smaller work; but some day he would slip this creature upon its prey. A few members of the lodge, Ted Baldwin among them, resented the rapid rise of the stranger and hated him for it; but they kept clear of him, for he was as ready to fight as to laugh.

麦金蒂已经有了足够的乐器，但是他认识到这是一件非常好的乐器。他觉得自己就像一个人用皮带牵着一只凶猛的猎犬。还有一些小工作要做，但总有一天他会让这个生物溜到它的猎物身上。小屋里的几个人，包括特德 · 鲍德温在内，对这个陌生人的迅速崛起感到愤怒，并因此而憎恨他; 但是他们对他敬而远之，因为他随时准备战斗，随时准备大笑。

But if he gained favour with his fellows, there was another quarter, one which had become even more vital to him, in which he lost it. Ettie Shafter's father would have nothing more to do with him, nor would he allow him to enter the house. Ettie herself was too deeply in love to give him up altogether, and yet her own good sense warned her of what would come from a marriage with a man who was regarded as a criminal.

但是，如果他赢得了同伴的好感，那么还有另一个方面，一个对他来说更加重要的方面，他却失去了。伊蒂 · 肖夫特的父亲再也不会和他有任何瓜葛，也不会允许他进入这所房子。埃蒂自己也深深地爱上了他，不愿意完全放弃他，然而她自己的良知却警告她，与一个被认为是罪犯的男人结婚会有什么后果。

One morning after a sleepless night she determined to see him, possibly for the last time, and make one strong endeavour to draw him from those evil influences which were sucking him down. She went to his house, as he had often begged her to do, and made her way into the room which he used as his sitting-room. He was seated at a table, with his back turned and a letter in front of him. A sudden spirit of girlish mischief came over her—she was still only nineteen. He had not heard her when she pushed open the door. Now she tiptoed forward and laid her hand lightly upon his bended shoulders.

一天早晨，在度过了一个不眠之夜后，她决定去看看他，也许是最后一次，尽最大的努力把他从那些把他压垮的邪恶势力中拉出来。她走进他的房子，就像他经常恳求她做的那样，走进他用作起居室的房间。他背对着桌子坐下，面前摆着一封信。她突然产生了一种少女的顽皮精神，那时她只有十九岁。她推开门时，他没有听见。现在她踮着脚向前走，轻轻地把手放在他弯曲的肩膀上。

If she had expected to startle him, she certainly succeeded; but only in turn to be startled herself. With a tiger spring he turned on her, and his right hand was feeling for her throat. At the same instant with the other hand he crumpled up the paper that lay before him. For an instant he stood glaring. Then astonishment and joy took the place of the ferocity which had convulsed his features—a ferocity which had sent her shrinking back in horror as from something which had never before intruded into her gentle life.

如果她想吓唬他的话，她当然成功了，但是反过来她自己也吓了一跳。他猛地一跳，转过身来，右手摸着她的喉咙。与此同时，他用另一只手把摆在他面前的纸揉成一团。他怒视着站了一会儿。然后，惊讶和喜悦取代了使他的面部痉挛的凶猛ーー凶猛使她惊恐地退缩回去，仿佛从未有什么东西闯入她温柔的生活。

“It's you!” said he, mopping his brow. “And to think that you should come to me, heart of my heart, and I should find nothing better to do than to want to strangle you! Come then, darling,” and he held out his arms, “let me make it up to you.”

“是你!”他一边说，一边擦着额头。”“想到你来找我，我的心啊，我找不到比勒死你更好的事了！“来吧，亲爱的,”他伸出胳膊，“让我补偿你吧。”

But she had not recovered from that sudden glimpse of guilty fear which she had read in the man's face. All her woman's instinct told her that it was not the mere fright of a man who is startled. Guilt—that was it—guilt and fear!

但是她还没有从那个男人脸上突然出现的内疚的恐惧中恢复过来。她所有的女人的本能告诉她，这不仅仅是一个男人的惊吓。罪恶感ーー就是这样ーー罪恶感和恐惧！

“What's come over you, Jack?” she cried. “Why were you so scared of me? Oh, Jack, if your conscience was at ease, you would not have looked at me like that!”

“你怎么了，杰克?”她哭了。“你为什么这么怕我？哦，杰克，如果你问心无愧的话，你就不会那样看着我了!”

“Sure, I was thinking of other things, and when you came tripping so lightly on those fairy feet of yours—”

“当然，我在想别的事情，当你轻轻地踏着你那双美丽的脚——”

“No, no, it was more than that, Jack.” Then a sudden suspicion seized her. “Let me see that letter you were writing.”

“不，不，不止如此，杰克。”这时，她突然产生了怀疑。“让我看看你写的那封信。”

“Ah, Ettie, I couldn't do that.”

“啊，埃蒂，我做不到。”

Her suspicions became certainties. “It's to another woman,” she cried. “I know it! Why else should you hold it from me? Was it to your wife that you were writing? How am I to know that you are not a married man—you, a stranger, that nobody knows?”

她的怀疑变得确定无疑。“这是给另一个女人的,”她喊道。“我知道！不然你为什么要瞒着我？你是在给你妻子写信吗？我怎么知道你不是一个已婚男人ーー你，一个没有人知道的陌生人?”

“I am not married, Ettie. See now, I swear it! You're the only one woman on earth to me. By the cross of Christ I swear it!”

“我没有结婚，伊蒂。看吧，我发誓！对我来说，你是地球上唯一的女人。我以基督的十字架起誓!”

He was so white with passionate earnestness that she could not but believe him.

他脸色苍白，一本正经，她不得不相信他。

“Well, then,” she cried, “why will you not show me the letter?”

“那么,”她喊道，“你为什么不给我看那封信呢?”

“I'll tell you, acushla,” said he. “I'm under oath not to show it, and just as I wouldn't break my word to you so I would keep it to those who hold my promise. It's the business of the lodge, and even to you it's secret. And if I was scared when a hand fell on me, can't you understand it when it might have been the hand of a detective?”

“我告诉你，acushla,”他说。“我发过誓，不会泄露出去，就像我不会食言，也不会对那些信守诺言的人食言。这是旅馆的事，即使对你来说也是秘密。如果有一只手落在我身上，我感到害怕，你难道不明白这可能是侦探的手吗?”

She felt that he was telling the truth. He gathered her into his arms and kissed away her fears and doubts.

她觉得他说的是实话。他把她抱在怀里，吻去了她的恐惧和疑虑。

“Sit here by me, then. It's a queer throne for such a queen; but it's the best your poor lover can find. He'll do better for you some of these days, I'm thinking. Now your mind is easy once again, is it not?”

“那就坐在我旁边吧。对于这样一个王后来说，这是一个奇怪的王座，但是这是你可怜的爱人能找到的最好的了。我想，有时候他会为你做得更好。现在你的头脑又变得轻松了，不是吗?”

“How can it ever be at ease, Jack, when I know that you are a criminal among criminals, when I never know the day that I may hear you are in court for murder? ‘McMurdo the Scowrer,’ that's what one of our boarders called you yesterday. It went through my heart like a knife.”

“杰克，当我知道你是罪犯中的罪犯，当我永远不知道有一天我会听到你因谋杀而出庭的消息时，我怎么能安心呢？“麦克默多的记者,”我们的一个寄宿生昨天这么叫你。它像一把刀一样刺穿了我的心。”

“Sure, hard words break no bones.”

“当然，严厉的话语不会使人骨折。”

“But they were true.”

“但它们是真实的。”

“Well, dear, it's not so bad as you think. We are but poor men that are trying in our own way to get our rights.”

”“好吧，亲爱的，没有你想的那么糟糕。我们只不过是穷人，正在以自己的方式争取自己的权利。”

Ettie threw her arms round her lover's neck. “Give it up, Jack! For my sake, for God's sake, give it up! It was to ask you that I came here to-day. Oh, Jack, see—I beg it of you on my bended knees! Kneeling here before you I implore you to give it up!”

埃蒂伸出双臂搂住她情人的脖子。“放弃吧，杰克！看在我的份上，看在上帝的份上，放弃吧！我今天来这里是为了请求你。哦，杰克，你看ーー我跪下来求你！我跪在你面前，恳求你放弃!”

He raised her and soothed her with her head against his breast.

他把她抬起来，用她的头顶着他的胸部使她平静下来。

“Sure, my darlin', you don't know what it is you are asking. How could I give it up when it would be to break my oath and to desert my comrades? If you could see how things stand with me you could never ask it of me. Besides, if I wanted to, how could I do it? You don't suppose that the lodge would let a man go free with all its secrets?”

“当然，亲爱的，你不知道你在要求什么。如果违背誓言，抛弃我的同志，我怎么能放弃呢？如果你能看到我的处境，你就永远不会要求我这么做了。而且，如果我想的话，我怎么能这么做呢？你不会以为这个小屋会让一个人带着它所有的秘密逍遥法外吧?”

“I've thought of that, Jack. I've planned it all. Father has saved some money. He is weary of this place where the fear of these people darkens our lives. He is ready to go. We would fly together to Philadelphia or New York, where we would be safe from them.”

“我想过了，杰克。我都计划好了。父亲存了一些钱。他厌倦了这个地方，在这里，对这些人的恐惧使我们的生活变得阴暗。他准备走了。我们会一起飞往费城或纽约，在那里我们可以远离他们。”

McMurdo laughed. “The lodge has a long arm. Do you think it could not stretch from here to Philadelphia or New York?”

麦克默多站笑了。“小屋有一条长长的臂膀。你认为它不能从这里延伸到费城或纽约吗?”

“Well, then, to the West, or to England, or to Germany, where father came from—anywhere to get away from this Valley of Fear!”

“好吧，那就去西方，或者去英国，或者去德国——父亲的故乡——去任何地方——离开这个恐惧之谷!”

McMurdo thought of old Brother Morris. “Sure, it is the second time I have heard the valley so named,” said he. “The shadow does indeed seem to lie heavy on some of you.”

麦克默多站想起了老莫里斯兄弟。“当然，这是我第二次听到这样的名字,”他说。“你们中的一些人似乎确实被阴影笼罩着。”

“It darkens every moment of our lives. Do you suppose that Ted Baldwin has ever forgiven us? If it were not that he fears you, what do you suppose our chances would be? If you saw the look in those dark, hungry eyes of his when they fall on me!”

“它使我们生活中的每一个时刻都黯然失色。你觉得 Ted Baldwin 会原谅我们吗？如果他不是怕你，你认为我们的机会有多大？如果你看到他那双黑色饥饿的眼睛落在我身上时的表情，你就知道了!”

“By Gar! I'd teach him better manners if I caught him at it! But see here, little girl. I can't leave here. I can't—take that from me once and for all. But if you will leave me to find my own way, I will try to prepare a way of getting honourably out of it.”

“以加尔之名！如果我抓到他，我会教他更好的礼貌！但是看这里，小女孩。我不能离开这。我不能一劳永逸地把它夺走。但如果你让我自己找路，我会努力准备一条体面的出路。”

“There is no honour in such a matter.”

“这种事毫无荣誉可言。”

“Well, well, it's just how you look at it. But if you'll give me six months, I'll work it so that I can leave without being ashamed to look others in the face.”

“好吧，好吧，这只是你怎么看待它。但是如果你给我六个月的时间，我会努力工作，这样我就可以毫不羞愧地离开而不用面对别人。”

The girl laughed with joy. “Six months!” she cried. “Is it a promise?”

女孩高兴地笑了。“六个月!”她喊道。“这是一个承诺吗?”

“Well, it may be seven or eight. But within a year at the furthest we will leave the valley behind us.”

”“嗯，可能是七八个。但最远在一年之内，我们就会离开山谷。”

It was the most that Ettie could obtain, and yet it was something. There was this distant light to illuminate the gloom of the immediate future. She returned to her father's house more light-hearted than she had ever been since Jack McMurdo had come into her life.

这是埃蒂能得到的最多的东西，但也是有价值的东西。远处的灯光照亮了不久将来的黑暗。自从杰克 · 麦克默多走进她的生活以来，她从未像现在这样轻松地回到父亲的家里。

It might be thought that as a member, all the doings of the society would be told to him; but he was soon to discover that the organization was wider and more complex than the simple lodge. Even Boss McGinty was ignorant as to many things; for there was an official named the County Delegate, living at Hobson's Patch farther down the line, who had power over several different lodges which he wielded in a sudden and arbitrary way. Only once did McMurdo see him, a sly, little gray-haired rat of a man, with a slinking gait and a sidelong glance which was charged with malice. Evans Pott was his name, and even the great Boss of Vermissa felt towards him something of the repulsion and fear which the huge Danton may have felt for the puny but dangerous Robespierre.

人们可能认为，作为一个成员，社会上所有的事情都会告诉他; 但是他很快就发现，这个组织比简单的小屋更广泛，更复杂。甚至麦金蒂老板对许多事情也一无所知; 因为有一个名叫县代表的官员，住在更远一点的霍布森小区，他突然武断地操纵着几个不同的客栈。麦克默多只见过他一次，他是一只狡猾的、灰白头发的老鼠，步履蹒跚，斜着眼睛，带着恶意。他的名字叫埃文斯 · 波特，甚至伟大的维米萨老板也对他产生了厌恶和恐惧，这种厌恶和恐惧可能是庞大的丹顿对弱小而危险的 Robespierre 产生的感觉。

One day Scanlan, who was McMurdo's fellow boarder, received a note from McGinty inclosing one from Evans Pott, which informed him that he was sending over two good men, Lawler and Andrews, who had instructions to act in the neighbourhood; though it was best for the cause that no particulars as to their objects should be given. Would the Bodymaster see to it that suitable arrangements be made for their lodgings and comfort until the time for action should arrive? McGinty added that it was impossible for anyone to remain secret at the Union House, and that, therefore, he would be obliged if McMurdo and Scanlan would put the strangers up for a few days in their boarding house.

一天，同住麦克默多的斯坎兰收到了麦克金蒂寄来的一张便条，上面写着埃文斯 · 波特，告诉他说他要派两个好人来，劳勒和安德鲁斯，他们奉命在附近行动; 不过为了这个目的，最好不要详细说明他们的目的。在采取行动的时机到来之前，Bodymaster 是否会确保为他们的住宿和舒适做出合适的安排？麦金蒂补充说，任何人都不可能在联合大厦保持秘密，因此，如果麦克默多和斯坎兰让这两个陌生人在他们的寄宿舍住上几天，他将不胜感激。

The same evening the two men arrived, each carrying his gripsack. Lawler was an elderly man, shrewd, silent, and self-contained, clad in an old black frock coat, which with his soft felt hat and ragged, grizzled beard gave him a general resemblance to an itinerant preacher. His companion Andrews was little more than a boy, frank-faced and cheerful, with the breezy manner of one who is out for a holiday and means to enjoy every minute of it. Both men were total abstainers, and behaved in all ways as exemplary members of the society, with the one simple exception that they were assassins who had often proved themselves to be most capable instruments for this association of murder. Lawler had already carried out fourteen commissions of the kind, and Andrews three.

同一天晚上，两个人各自拿着他的手提袋来了。劳勒是个老人，精明、沉默、自制，穿着一件黑色的旧礼服，软毡帽和灰白的胡子使他看起来像一个流动的传教士。他的同伴安德鲁斯和一个男孩差不多，面容坦率，性格开朗，活泼轻松，就像一个外出度假的人，想要享受度假的每一分钟。这两个人都是彻头彻尾的戒酒者，在各方面都是社会的楷模，只有一个例外，那就是他们都是杀手，经常证明自己是这种谋杀联想的最有能力的工具。劳勒已经完成了十四次这样的委托，安德鲁斯三次。

They were, as McMurdo found, quite ready to converse about their deeds in the past, which they recounted with the half-bashful pride of men who had done good and unselfish service for the community. They were reticent, however, as to the immediate job in hand.

正如麦克默多站所发现的那样，他们随时准备谈谈他们过去的所作所为，他们带着那些为社会做了善事和无私奉献的人们的半害羞的自豪感叙述这些事迹。然而，他们对眼前的工作却保持沉默。

“They chose us because neither I nor the boy here drink,” Lawler explained. “They can count on us saying no more than we should. You must not take it amiss, but it is the orders of the County Delegate that we obey.”

“他们选择我们是因为我和这里的男孩都不喝酒,”劳勒解释说。“他们可以指望我们说的比我们应该说的多。你不要误会，这是县代表的命令，我们必须服从。”

“Sure, we are all in it together,” said Scanlan, McMurdo's mate, as the four sat together at supper.

“当然，我们都是一伙的,”麦克默多站的大副斯坎兰说，这时他们四个正坐在一起吃晚饭。

“That's true enough, and we'll talk till the cows come home of the killing of Charlie Williams or of Simon Bird, or any other job in the past. But till the work is done we say nothing.”

“这倒是真的，我们可以一直聊到查理 · 威廉姆斯、西蒙 · 伯德或者其他任何过去的工作被杀死为止。但工作完成之前，我们什么也不说。”

“There are half a dozen about here that I have a word to say to,” said McMurdo, with an oath. “I suppose it isn't Jack Knox of Ironhill that you are after. I'd go some way to see him get his deserts.”

“这里大约有六个人我有话要说,”麦克默多站宣誓说。“我想你要找的不是艾恩希尔的杰克 · 诺克斯。我会想办法让他得到应有的惩罚。”

“No, it's not him yet.”

“不，还不是他。”

“Or Herman Strauss?”

“还是赫尔曼 · 施特劳斯?”

“No, nor him either.”

“不，他也不是。”

“Well, if you won't tell us we can't make you; but I'd be glad to know.”

“好吧，如果你不告诉我们，我们不能强迫你，但我很乐意知道。”

Lawler smiled and shook his head. He was not to be drawn.

劳勒微笑着摇了摇头。他不会被吸引的。

In spite of the reticence of their guests, Scanlan and McMurdo were quite determined to be present at what they called “the fun.” When, therefore, at an early hour one morning McMurdo heard them creeping down the stairs he awakened Scanlan, and the two hurried on their clothes. When they were dressed they found that the others had stolen out, leaving the door open behind them. It was not yet dawn, and by the light of the lamps they could see the two men some distance down the street. They followed them warily, treading noiselessly in the deep snow.

尽管客人们沉默寡言，但斯坎兰和麦克默多站坚决要参加他们所谓的“娱乐活动”因此，一天清晨，麦克默多听到他们爬下楼梯的声音时，他叫醒了斯坎兰，两人急忙穿上衣服。当他们穿好衣服，他们发现其他人已经偷偷溜出去了，留下门在他们身后敞开着。天还没亮，借着灯光，他们可以看到街上不远处的两个人。他们小心翼翼地跟着他们，在深雪中无声无息地走着。

The boarding house was near the edge of the town, and soon they were at the crossroads which is beyond its boundary. Here three men were waiting, with whom Lawler and Andrews held a short, eager conversation. Then they all moved on together. It was clearly some notable job which needed numbers. At this point there are several trails which lead to various mines. The strangers took that which led to the Crow Hill, a huge business which was in strong hands which had been able, thanks to their energetic and fearless New England manager, Josiah H. Dunn, to keep some order and discipline during the long reign of terror.

寄宿家庭在城镇的边缘附近，很快他们就到了城镇边界以外的十字路口。这儿有三个人在等着，劳勒和安德鲁斯同他们进行了一次简短而热切的谈话。然后他们一起继续生活。这显然是一项需要数字的重要工作。这里有几条小路通往各种各样的地雷。陌生人拿走了通往克劳山的道路，这是一家大公司，由于他们精力充沛、无所畏惧的新英格兰地区经理乔西亚 · h · 邓恩在长期的恐怖统治中保持了一定的秩序和纪律。

Day was breaking now, and a line of workmen were slowly making their way, singly and in groups, along the blackened path.

天亮了，一队工人正沿着漆黑的小路慢慢地走着，有的是单独的，有的是成群结队的。

McMurdo and Scanlan strolled on with the others, keeping in sight of the men whom they followed. A thick mist lay over them, and from the heart of it there came the sudden scream of a steam whistle. It was the ten-minute signal before the cages descended and the day's labour began.

麦克默多站和斯坎兰与其他人一起散步，紧盯着他们跟踪的人。他们身上笼罩着一层厚厚的雾气，从雾气的中心突然传来汽笛的尖叫声。这是笼子降落和一天的劳动开始前的十分钟信号。

When they reached the open space round the mine shaft there were a hundred miners waiting, stamping their feet and blowing on their fingers; for it was bitterly cold. The strangers stood in a little group under the shadow of the engine house. Scanlan and McMurdo climbed a heap of slag from which the whole scene lay before them. They saw the mine engineer, a great bearded Scotchman named Menzies, come out of the engine house and blow his whistle for the cages to be lowered.

当他们到达矿井周围的空地时，有一百个矿工在等着他们，跺着脚，吹着手指，因为天气非常寒冷。陌生人在机房的阴影下站成一小群。斯坎兰和麦克默多站爬上了一堆炉渣，整个场景就摆在他们面前。他们看到矿井工程师，一个名叫孟席斯的大胡子苏格兰人，从机房里走出来，吹着哨子，把笼子放下来。

At the same instant a tall, loose-framed young man with a clean-shaved, earnest face advanced eagerly towards the pit head. As he came forward his eyes fell upon the group, silent and motionless, under the engine house. The men had drawn down their hats and turned up their collars to screen their faces. For a moment the presentiment of Death laid its cold hand upon the manager's heart. At the next he had shaken it off and saw only his duty towards intrusive strangers.

与此同时，一个高大宽松的年轻人，剃着光头，面色严肃，急切地向坑头走来。当他向前走时，他的目光落在了机舱下面的那群人身上，他们沉默着，一动不动。男人们脱下帽子，竖起领子遮住脸。有一会儿，死亡的预感把它冰冷的手放在了经理的心上。到了第二天，他已经摆脱了这一切，只看到自己对那些不速之客的责任。

“Who are you?” he asked as he advanced. “What are you loitering there for?”

“你是谁?”他边走边问。“你在那儿闲逛干什么?”

There was no answer; but the lad Andrews stepped forward and shot him in the stomach. The hundred waiting miners stood as motionless and helpless as if they were paralyzed. The manager clapped his two hands to the wound and doubled himself up. Then he staggered away; but another of the assassins fired, and he went down sidewise, kicking and clawing among a heap of clinkers. Menzies, the Scotchman, gave a roar of rage at the sight and rushed with an iron spanner at the murderers; but was met by two balls in the face which dropped him dead at their very feet.

没有人回答; 但是那个小伙子安德鲁斯走上前来，朝他的腹部开了一枪。数百名等待的矿工一动不动，无助地站在那里，好像瘫痪了一样。经理用双手捂住伤口，蜷缩起身子。然后他摇摇晃晃地走开了，但是另一个刺客开了枪，他侧着身子走下去，在一堆铁棍中踢踢抓抓地。苏格兰人孟席斯一见此情景，怒吼了一声，拿着铁扳手向凶手冲去，但却遭到两颗子弹打在脸上，把他打死在他们的脚下。

There was a surge forward of some of the miners, and an inarticulate cry of pity and of anger; but a couple of the strangers emptied their six-shooters over the heads of the crowd, and they broke and scattered, some of them rushing wildly back to their homes in Vermissa.

一些矿工涌上前来，发出一声难以言喻的怜悯和愤怒的呼喊; 但是一对陌生人从人群头顶上掏空了他们的六发枪，他们散开了，其中一些人疯狂地跑回了他们在 Vermissa 的家。

When a few of the bravest had rallied, and there was a return to the mine, the murderous gang had vanished in the mists of morning, without a single witness being able to swear to the identity of these men who in front of a hundred spectators had wrought this double crime.

当几个最勇敢的人集合起来，回到矿井时，杀人团伙在早晨的薄雾中消失了，没有一个目击者能够在一百名观众面前对这两个人的身份发誓。

Scanlan and McMurdo made their way back; Scanlan somewhat subdued, for it was the first murder job that he had seen with his own eyes, and it appeared less funny than he had been led to believe. The horrible screams of the dead manager's wife pursued them as they hurried to the town. McMurdo was absorbed and silent; but he showed no sympathy for the weakening of his companion.

斯坎兰和麦克默多站回来了; 斯坎兰有些克制，因为这是他亲眼看到的第一起谋杀案，看起来没有他被引导去相信的那么有趣。在他们匆忙赶往城里时，死去的经理的妻子发出了可怕的尖叫声，追赶着他们。麦克默多站全神贯注，沉默不语，但他对他同伴的软弱毫无同情之心。

“Sure, it is like a war,” he repeated. “What is it but a war between us and them, and we hit back where we best can.”

“当然，这就像一场战争,”他重复道。“这只不过是我们和他们之间的一场战争，我们尽最大努力予以还击。”

There was high revel in the lodge room at the Union House that night, not only over the killing of the manager and engineer of the Crow Hill mine, which would bring this organization into line with the other blackmailed and terror-stricken companies of the district, but also over a distant triumph which had been wrought by the hands of the lodge itself.

那天晚上，人们在联合大厦的小屋里狂欢作乐，不仅因为克劳山矿场的经理和工程师被杀，这使得这个组织与该地区其他受到勒索和恐怖袭击的公司步调一致，而且还因为小屋本身所取得的一次遥远的胜利。

It would appear that when the County Delegate had sent over five good men to strike a blow in Vermissa, he had demanded that in return three Vermissa men should be secretly selected and sent across to kill William Hales of Stake Royal, one of the best known and most popular mine owners in the Gilmerton district, a man who was believed not to have an enemy in the world; for he was in all ways a model employer. He had insisted, however, upon efficiency in the work, and had, therefore, paid off certain drunken and idle employees who were members of the all-powerful society. Coffin notices hung outside his door had not weakened his resolution, and so in a free, civilized country he found himself condemned to death.

看起来，当郡代表派出5个好人在 Vermissa 进行一次打击时，他要求作为回报，秘密挑选3个维尔米萨人，派他们去杀死威廉 · 黑尔斯，他是利萨特 · 罗亚尔，吉尔默顿地区最著名和最受欢迎的矿主之一，人们认为他在世界上没有敌人，因为他在各方面都是一个模范雇主。然而，他坚持要求工作效率高，因此，他付钱给某些醉醺醺、无所事事的雇员，这些雇员都是全能社会的成员。门外张贴的棺材告示并没有削弱他的决心，因此在一个自由、文明的国家，他发现自己被判了死刑。

The execution had now been duly carried out. Ted Baldwin, who sprawled now in the seat of honour beside the Bodymaster, had been chief of the party. His flushed face and glazed, blood-shot eyes told of sleeplessness and drink. He and his two comrades had spent the night before among the mountains. They were unkempt and weather-stained. But no heroes, returning from a forlorn hope, could have had a warmer welcome from their comrades.

现在处决已经按时执行了。特德 · 鲍德温，现在摊开四肢躺在身体主人旁边的荣誉座位上，曾经是这个党的领袖。他涨红的脸和呆滞的充血的眼睛说明他失眠和酗酒。他和他的两个同志前一天晚上在山里过夜。他们蓬头垢面，衣衫褴褛。但是，任何从绝望的希望中归来的英雄，都不会受到战友们的热烈欢迎。

The story was told and retold amid cries of delight and shouts of laughter. They had waited for their man as he drove home at nightfall, taking their station at the top of a steep hill, where his horse must be at a walk. He was so furred to keep out the cold that he could not lay his hand on his pistol. They had pulled him out and shot him again and again. He had screamed for mercy. The screams were repeated for the amusement of the lodge.

这个故事在欢呼和笑声中被讲了又讲。他们一直在等待他们的男人在黄昏时驾车回家，在陡峭的山顶上找到他们的座位，他的马必须在那里散步。他穿着厚厚的毛皮来御寒，以至于他无法把手放在手枪上。他们把他拉出来，一次又一次地向他开枪。他尖叫着求饶。为了娱乐旅馆，尖叫声不断地重复着。

“Let's hear again how he squealed,” they cried.

“让我们再听听他是怎么尖叫的,”他们喊道。

None of them knew the man; but there is eternal drama in a killing, and they had shown the Scowrers of Gilmerton that the Vermissa men were to be relied upon.

他们都不认识这个人，但是杀戮是永恒的戏剧，他们向吉尔默顿的司考勒们展示了维米萨人是可以信赖的。

There had been one contretemps; for a man and his wife had driven up while they were still emptying their revolvers into the silent body. It had been suggested that they should shoot them both; but they were harmless folk who were not connected with the mines, so they were sternly bidden to drive on and keep silent, lest a worse thing befall them. And so the blood-mottled figure had been left as a warning to all such hard-hearted employers, and the three noble avengers had hurried off into the mountains where unbroken nature comes down to the very edge of the furnaces and the slag heaps. Here they were, safe and sound, their work well done, and the plaudits of their companions in their ears.

有一次发生了意外，因为一个男人和他的妻子在他们还在向沉默的身体里掏出左轮手枪的时候就开车上路了。有人建议他们把两个人都打死，但他们是无害的人，与地雷没有关系，所以他们被严厉地命令继续前进，保持沉默，以免更糟糕的事情降临到他们头上。于是，这个血迹斑斑的身影被留下来，作为对所有这些铁石心肠雇主的警告。三位高贵的复仇者匆匆走进了山里，那里连绵不断的自然一直延伸到熔炉和矿渣堆的边缘。他们安然无恙地在这里，他们的工作做得很好，他们的同伴在他们的耳边喝彩。

It had been a great day for the Scowrers. The shadow had fallen even darker over the valley. But as the wise general chooses the moment of victory in which to redouble his efforts, so that his foes may have no time to steady themselves after disaster, so Boss McGinty, looking out upon the scene of his operations with his brooding and malicious eyes, had devised a new attack upon those who opposed him. That very night, as the half-drunken company broke up, he touched McMurdo on the arm and led him aside into that inner room where they had their first interview.

对斯科勒家族来说，这是伟大的一天。山谷上空的阴影越来越暗。但是，当聪明的将军选择胜利的时刻加倍努力，使他的敌人可能没有时间在灾难后稳定自己，所以麦金蒂老板，用他的深沉而恶毒的眼睛看着他的行动现场，已经设计了一个新的攻击谁反对他。就在那个半醉的公司解散的当晚，他轻轻地碰了碰麦克默多站的胳膊，把他带到里屋，在那里他们进行了第一次面试。

“See here, my lad,” said he, “I've got a job that's worthy of you at last. You'll have the doing of it in your own hands.”

“你看，我的孩子,”他说，“我终于找到了一份配得上你的工作。你可以自己做这件事。”

“Proud I am to hear it,” McMurdo answered.

“听到这个消息我很自豪,”麦克默多回答说。

“You can take two men with you—Manders and Reilly. They have been warned for service. We'll never be right in this district until Chester Wilcox has been settled, and you'll have the thanks of every lodge in the coal fields if you can down him.”

“你可以带上两个人——曼德斯和莱利。他们受到了服务警告。在切斯特 · 威尔科克斯安顿下来之前，我们永远不会在这个地区安顿下来，如果你能把他安顿下来，你会得到煤田里每个小屋的感谢。”

“I'll do my best, anyhow. Who is he, and where shall I find him?”

“不管怎样，我会尽力而为的。他是谁，我到哪里去找他呢?”

McGinty took his eternal half-chewed, half-smoked cigar from the corner of his mouth, and proceeded to draw a rough diagram on a page torn from his notebook.

麦金蒂从嘴角拿出他那永远嚼了一半、抽了一半的雪茄，开始在从笔记本上撕下来的一页上画一个粗略的图表。

“He's the chief foreman of the Iron Dike Company. He's a hard citizen, an old colour sergeant of the war, all scars and grizzle. We've had two tries at him; but had no luck, and Jim Carnaway lost his life over it. Now it's for you to take it over. That's the house—all alone at the Iron Dike crossroad, same as you see here on the map—without another within earshot. It's no good by day. He's armed and shoots quick and straight, with no questions asked. But at night—well, there he is with his wife, three children, and a hired help. You can't pick or choose. It's all or none. If you could get a bag of blasting powder at the front door with a slow match to it—”

“他是铁堤公司的主要领班。他是一个严厉的公民，一个上了年纪的军队中士，浑身伤痕累累。我们已经试过两次了，但都没有成功，吉姆 · 卡纳韦也因此丧了命。现在轮到你接手了。这就是那所房子ーー就在铁堤十字路口，和你在地图上看到的一样ーー听不到任何声音。白天不行。他全副武装，毫无疑问地迅速而直接地射击。但是到了晚上，他和他的妻子，三个孩子，还有一个雇来的帮手在一起。你不能挑挑拣拣。要么全部，要么一无所有。如果你能在前门拿一袋与之慢火柴相配的炸药——”

“What's the man done?”

“这个人做了什么?”

“Didn't I tell you he shot Jim Carnaway?”

“我不是告诉过你他开枪打了吉姆 · 卡纳韦吗?”

“Why did he shoot him?”

“他为什么开枪打他?”

“What in thunder has that to do with you? Carnaway was about his house at night, and he shot him. That's enough for me and you. You've got to settle the thing right.”

“这跟你有什么关系？卡纳维晚上在他家附近，他开枪打死了他。这对你我来说已经足够了。你必须把事情解决好。”

“There's these two women and the children. Do they go up too?”

“有两个女人和孩子，他们也上去了吗?”

“They have to—else how can we get him?”

“他们不得不——否则我们怎么才能抓到他?”

“It seems hard on them; for they've done nothing.”

“这对他们来说似乎很难，因为他们什么也没做。”

“What sort of fool's talk is this? Do you back out?”

“这是什么傻话? 你要退出吗?”

“Easy, Councillor, easy! What have I ever said or done that you should think I would be after standing back from an order of the Bodymaster of my own lodge? If it's right or if it's wrong, it's for you to decide.”

“放轻松，议员，放轻松！我曾经说过或者做过什么让你认为我在违背了我自己小屋的身体主人的命令后还会这样做？是对是错，由你来决定。”

“You'll do it, then?”

“那么，你愿意做吗?”

“Of course I will do it.”

“我当然会这么做。”

“When?”

“什么时候?”

“Well, you had best give me a night or two that I may see the house and make my plans. Then—”

”“那么，你最好给我一两个晚上的时间，让我看看房子，作个计划。然后ーー”

“Very good,” said McGinty, shaking him by the hand. “I leave it with you. It will be a great day when you bring us the news. It's just the last stroke that will bring them all to their knees.”

“很好,”麦金蒂握着他的手说。“我把它留给你了。当你给我们带来这个消息时，那将是一个伟大的日子。这只是最后一击，将使他们所有人屈服。”

McMurdo thought long and deeply over the commission which had been so suddenly placed in his hands. The isolated house in which Chester Wilcox lived was about five miles off in an adjacent valley. That very night he started off all alone to prepare for the attempt. It was daylight before he returned from his reconnaissance. Next day he interviewed his two subordinates, Manders and Reilly, reckless youngsters who were as elated as if it were a deer-hunt.

麦克默多想了很久，深深地思考了一下这个突然交到他手里的任务。切斯特 · 威尔科克斯所居住的孤零零的房子距离附近的一个山谷大约五英里。就在那天晚上，他独自出发去准备这次尝试。天亮了，他才侦察完回来。第二天，他采访了他的两个下属，曼德斯和赖利，这两个鲁莽的年轻人就像猎鹿一样兴高采烈。

Two nights later they met outside the town, all three armed, and one of them carrying a sack stuffed with the powder which was used in the quarries. It was two in the morning before they came to the lonely house. The night was a windy one, with broken clouds drifting swiftly across the face of a three-quarter moon. They had been warned to be on their guard against bloodhounds; so they moved forward cautiously, with their pistols cocked in their hands. But there was no sound save the howling of the wind, and no movement but the swaying branches above them.

两天后的晚上，他们在城外碰头，三个人都带着武器，其中一个人背着一个装满了采石场用的火药的袋子。凌晨两点钟，他们才来到这座孤零零的房子。那天晚上刮着风，破碎的云彩在一轮四分之三的月亮上飞快地飘过。有人警告他们要小心警犬，所以他们小心翼翼地向前走去，手枪上了膛。但是除了风的呼啸，没有任何声音，除了上面摇曳的树枝，没有任何动静。

McMurdo listened at the door of the lonely house; but all was still within. Then he leaned the powder bag against it, ripped a hole in it with his knife, and attached the fuse. When it was well alight he and his two companions took to their heels, and were some distance off, safe and snug in a sheltering ditch, before the shattering roar of the explosion, with the low, deep rumble of the collapsing building, told them that their work was done. No cleaner job had ever been carried out in the bloodstained annals of the society.

麦克默多站在孤零零的房子门口听着，但一切都还在里面。然后他把粉袋靠在上面，用刀在上面划了一个洞，接上了保险丝。天亮了以后，他和他的两个同伴就跑开了，离开了一段距离，安全舒适地躲在一个隐蔽的水沟里，直到爆炸发出震耳欲聋的爆炸声，倒塌的建筑物发出低沉而深沉的隆隆声，告诉他们工作已经完成。在这个社会的血腥史册中，从来没有进行过比这更干净的工作。

But alas that work so well organized and boldly carried out should all have gone for nothing! Warned by the fate of the various victims, and knowing that he was marked down for destruction, Chester Wilcox had moved himself and his family only the day before to some safer and less known quarters, where a guard of police should watch over them. It was an empty house which had been torn down by the gunpowder, and the grim old colour sergeant of the war was still teaching discipline to the miners of Iron Dike.

但是，唉，这么好的组织和大胆的执行工作应该都白费了！切斯特 · 威尔科克斯被各种受害者的命运所警告，并且知道自己已经被标记为毁灭性的，因此仅仅在前一天，他和他的家人搬到了一个更安全、更不为人所知的地方，在那里有一个警卫看守着他们。这是一座空房子，已经被火药拆除了，冷酷无情的老战士仍然在教导铁堤的矿工们纪律。

“Leave him to me,” said McMurdo. “He's my man, and I'll get him sure if I have to wait a year for him.”

“把他交给我吧,”麦克默多站说。“他是我的人，如果要等他一年，我一定会找到他的。”

A vote of thanks and confidence was passed in full lodge, and so for the time the matter ended. When a few weeks later it was reported in the papers that Wilcox had been shot at from an ambuscade, it was an open secret that McMurdo was still at work upon his unfinished job.

全体会议通过了一张表示感谢和信任的票，这件事就这样结束了。几个星期后，报纸报道威尔科克斯被埋伏者击中，麦克默多仍在继续他未完成的工作，这是一个公开的秘密。

Such were the methods of the Society of Freemen, and such were the deeds of the Scowrers by which they spread their rule of fear over the great and rich district which was for so long a period haunted by their terrible presence. Why should these pages be stained by further crimes? Have I not said enough to show the men and their methods?

这就是自由人协会的方法，这就是斯考尔人的行为，他们用这种方法把他们的恐怖统治传播到这个伟大而富饶的地区，这个地区长期以来一直被他们可怕的存在所困扰。为什么这些页面会被进一步的犯罪玷污？难道我说的还不足以向他们展示他们的手段吗？

These deeds are written in history, and there are records wherein one may read the details of them. There one may learn of the shooting of Policemen Hunt and Evans because they had ventured to arrest two members of the society—a double outrage planned at the Vermissa lodge and carried out in cold blood upon two helpless and disarmed men. There also one may read of the shooting of Mrs. Larbey when she was nursing her husband, who had been beaten almost to death by orders of Boss McGinty. The killing of the elder Jenkins, shortly followed by that of his brother, the mutilation of James Murdoch, the blowing up of the Staphouse family, and the murder of the Stendals all followed hard upon one another in the same terrible winter.

这些事迹都写在历史上，有记录可供人们详细阅读。在那里，人们可以知道警察亨特和埃文斯被枪杀的事情，因为他们冒险逮捕了两名社团成员ーー这是一起针对 Vermissa 小屋的冷血双重暴行，发生在两个无助的、已经解除武装的人身上。还有人可能读到拉贝太太在喂养她丈夫时被枪杀的消息，她的丈夫在麦金蒂老板的命令下差点被打死。在同一个可怕的冬天里，老詹金斯的死、他兄弟的死、詹姆斯 · 默多克的残肢断臂、斯台普豪斯家族的灭亡以及斯坦达尔夫妇的死，这一切都紧接着发生。

Darkly the shadow lay upon the Valley of Fear. The spring had come with running brooks and blossoming trees. There was hope for all Nature bound so long in an iron grip; but nowhere was there any hope for the men and women who lived under the yoke of the terror. Never had the cloud above them been so dark and hopeless as in the early summer of the year 1875.

黑暗的阴影笼罩着恐惧之谷。春天来了，小溪流淌，树木开花。所有被铁腕束缚了这么久的自然界都有希望，但是生活在恐怖枷锁下的男男女女却没有任何希望。1875年初夏，他们头顶上的乌云从来没有这么黑暗和绝望过。
