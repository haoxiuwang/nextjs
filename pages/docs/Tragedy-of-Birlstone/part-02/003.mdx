  book: "The Tragedy of Birlstone"
}

On the day following the evening which had contained so many exciting events, McMurdo moved his lodgings from old Jacob Shafter's and took up his quarters at the Widow MacNamara's on the extreme outskirts of the town. Scanlan, his original acquaintance aboard the train, had occasion shortly afterwards to move into Vermissa, and the two lodged together. There was no other boarder, and the hostess was an easy-going old Irishwoman who left them to themselves; so that they had a freedom for speech and action welcome to men who had secrets in common.

第二天晚上，发生了许多激动人心的事情，麦克默多从老雅各布 · 沙福特那里搬了出来，住进了镇子最边缘的麦克纳马拉寡妇那里。他最初在火车上认识的斯坎兰不久就搬到了 Vermissa，两人住在了一起。没有其他的寄宿者，女主人是一个随和的爱尔兰老妇人，把他们留给了自己; 因此他们有言论和行动的自由，欢迎有共同秘密的男人。

Shafter had relented to the extent of letting McMurdo come to his meals there when he liked; so that his intercourse with Ettie was by no means broken. On the contrary, it drew closer and more intimate as the weeks went by.

沙夫特已经让步，允许麦克默多在他喜欢的时候到那里吃饭，所以他和埃蒂的交往并没有中断。相反，随着时间的推移，它变得越来越亲密。

In his bedroom at his new abode McMurdo felt it safe to take out the coining moulds, and under many a pledge of secrecy a number of brothers from the lodge were allowed to come in and see them, each carrying away in his pocket some examples of the false money, so cunningly struck that there was never the slightest difficulty or danger in passing it. Why, with such a wonderful art at his command, McMurdo should condescend to work at all was a perpetual mystery to his companions; though he made it clear to anyone who asked him that if he lived without any visible means it would very quickly bring the police upon his track.

在麦克默多新居的卧室里，他觉得拿出铸币模具是安全的，而且在许多保密的承诺下，旅馆的一些兄弟被允许进来看他们，每个人口袋里都装着一些假币的样品，巧妙地敲打着，以至于传递假币从来没有任何困难或危险。为什么在他掌握如此精湛的艺术之后，麦克默多站居然屈尊去工作，这对他的同伴来说是一个永恒的谜团; 尽管他向任何问他是否生活在没有任何可见手段的情况下，很快警察就会找到他的踪迹。

One policeman was indeed after him already; but the incident, as luck would have it, did the adventurer a great deal more good than harm. After the first introduction there were few evenings when he did not find his way to McGinty's saloon, there to make closer acquaintance with “the boys,” which was the jovial title by which the dangerous gang who infested the place were known to one another. His dashing manner and fearlessness of speech made him a favourite with them all; while the rapid and scientific way in which he polished off his antagonist in an “all in” bar-room scrap earned the respect of that rough community. Another incident, however, raised him even higher in their estimation.

确实已经有一个警察在追捕他了，但是这次事故，幸运的是，对这个冒险家来说，利大于弊。第一次见面之后，有几个晚上，他没有找到去麦金蒂酒吧的路，而是去那里和“孩子们”更近一些，这是一个愉快的称呼，那个危险的团伙出没在那个地方，他们互相认识。他勇猛的举止和无畏的言谈使他受到大家的喜爱，而他在一个“全能”的酒吧间小打小闹中迅速而科学地消灭对手的方式赢得了这个粗野的社会的尊敬。然而，另一件事使他在他们的评价中更高了。

Just at the crowded hour one night, the door opened and a man entered with the quiet blue uniform and peaked cap of the mine police. This was a special body raised by the railways and colliery owners to supplement the efforts of the ordinary civil police, who were perfectly helpless in the face of the organized ruffianism which terrorized the district. There was a hush as he entered, and many a curious glance was cast at him; but the relations between policemen and criminals are peculiar in some parts of the States, and McGinty himself standing behind his counter, showed no surprise when the policeman enrolled himself among his customers.

一天晚上，就在这个拥挤的时刻，门开了，一个男人走了进来，他穿着安静的蓝色制服，戴着矿警的尖顶帽。这是铁路和煤矿业主设立的一个专门机构，以补充普通民警的努力，他们在面对有组织的暴徒恐吓该地区时完全无能为力。但是在美国的一些地方，警察和罪犯之间的关系是特殊的，麦金蒂本人站在柜台后面，当警察把自己列入他的顾客之中时，并没有表现出惊讶。

“A straight whisky, for the night is bitter,” said the police officer. “I don't think we have met before, Councillor?”

“一杯纯威士忌，因为晚上喝起来很苦,”警察说，“我想我们以前没有见过面，议员先生?”

“You'll be the new captain?” said McGinty.

“你将成为新的船长?”麦金蒂说。

“That's so. We're looking to you, Councillor, and to the other leading citizens, to help us in upholding law and order in this township. Captain Marvin is my name.”

“就是这样。我们期待着你，议员，以及其他主要市民，帮助我们维护这个城镇的法律和秩序。我叫马文船长。”

“We'd do better without you, Captain Marvin,” said McGinty coldly; “for we have our own police of the township, and no need for any imported goods. What are you but the paid tool of the capitalists, hired by them to club or shoot your poorer fellow citizen?”

“没有你，我们会过得更好，马文队长,”麦金蒂冷冷地说，“因为我们镇上有自己的警察，不需要任何进口货物。你只不过是资本家雇来打棒球或射杀穷人的有偿工具罢了。”

“Well, well, we won't argue about that,” said the police officer good-humouredly. “I expect we all do our duty same as we see it; but we can't all see it the same.” He had drunk off his glass and had turned to go, when his eyes fell upon the face of Jack McMurdo, who was scowling at his elbow. “Hullo! Hullo!” he cried, looking him up and down. “Here's an old acquaintance!”

“好吧，好吧，我们不争论这个问题,”警官和颜悦色地说。“我希望我们所有人都能按照自己的看法履行自己的职责，但我们的看法不可能完全一致。”他喝光了杯子里的酒，转身要走，这时他的目光落到了杰克 · 麦克默多的脸上，他的眼睛在他的胳膊肘旁皱着眉头。“喂！你好!”他哭了，上下打量着他。“老熟人来了!”

McMurdo shrank away from him. “I was never a friend to you nor any other cursed copper in my life,” said he.

麦克默多躲开了他。“在我的一生中，我从来都不是你的朋友，也不是任何一个被诅咒的警察,”他说。

“An acquaintance isn't always a friend,” said the police captain, grinning. “You're Jack McMurdo of Chicago, right enough, and don't you deny it!”

“熟人并不总是朋友,”警察队长咧嘴笑着说。“你是芝加哥的杰克 · 麦克默多，对极了，别否认!”

McMurdo shrugged his shoulders. “I'm not denying it,” said he. “D'ye think I'm ashamed of my own name?”

麦克默多耸了耸肩。“我不否认,”他说。“你认为我为自己的名字感到羞耻吗?”

“You've got good cause to be, anyhow.”

“不管怎么说，你有充分的理由生气。”

“What the devil d'you mean by that?” he roared with his fists clenched.

“你这话是什么意思?”他紧握着拳头吼道。

“No, no, Jack, bluster won't do with me. I was an officer in Chicago before ever I came to this darned coal bunker, and I know a Chicago crook when I see one.”

“不，不，杰克，吓唬我是不行的。在我来到这个该死的煤仓之前，我是芝加哥的一名警官，我一眼就认出了一个芝加哥的骗子。”

McMurdo's face fell. “Don't tell me that you're Marvin of the Chicago Central!” he cried.

“别告诉我你是《芝加哥中央报》的马文!”他哭了。

“Just the same old Teddy Marvin, at your service. We haven't forgotten the shooting of Jonas Pinto up there.”

“还是老样子的泰迪 · 马文，听候差遣。我们没有忘记乔纳斯 · 平托在那里被枪杀的事。”

“I never shot him.”

“我从没开枪打过他。”

“Did you not? That's good impartial evidence, ain't it? Well, his death came in uncommon handy for you, or they would have had you for shoving the queer. Well, we can let that be bygones; for, between you and me—and perhaps I'm going further than my duty in saying it—they could get no clear case against you, and Chicago's open to you to-morrow.”

”“不是吗？这是很好的公正证据，不是吗？好吧，他的死对你来说不是什么好事，否则他们早就把你当同性恋了。那么，我们就让这件事过去吧，因为，在你我之间——也许我说这些话超出了我的职责范围——他们对你没有明确的指控，芝加哥明天就对你敞开大门。”

“I'm very well where I am.”

“我现在感觉很好。”

“Well, I've given you the pointer, and you're a sulky dog not to thank me for it.”

“好吧，我已经给了你一个指示器，而你是一只生气的狗，不感谢我。”

“Well, I suppose you mean well, and I do thank you,” said McMurdo in no very gracious manner.

“好吧，我想你是出于好意，我真的很感谢你,”麦克默多站没有什么风度地说。

“It's mum with me so long as I see you living on the straight,” said the captain. “But, by the Lord! if you get off after this, it's another story! So good-night to you—and goodnight, Councillor.”

“只要我看到你一直生活在正道上，我就不会怪我妈,”船长说。”“但是，以主的名义！如果你在这之后下车，那就是另一个故事了！晚安，晚安，议员。”

He left the bar-room; but not before he had created a local hero. McMurdo's deeds in far Chicago had been whispered before. He had put off all questions with a smile, as one who did not wish to have greatness thrust upon him. But now the thing was officially confirmed. The bar loafers crowded round him and shook him heartily by the hand. He was free of the community from that time on. He could drink hard and show little trace of it; but that evening, had his mate Scanlan not been at hand to lead him home, the feted hero would surely have spent his night under the bar.

他离开了酒吧间，但是在那之前，他已经创造了一个当地的英雄。麦克默多站在遥远的芝加哥的所作所为以前也曾被人议论过。他微笑着回避了所有的问题，就像一个不希望伟大强加于他身上的人一样。但是现在这件事被官方证实了。酒吧里的流浪汉围着他，热情地握着他的手。从那时起，他就脱离了这个社区。但是那天晚上，如果他的伙伴斯坎兰不在身边带他回家，这位受人尊敬的英雄肯定会在吧台下度过他的夜晚。

On a Saturday night McMurdo was introduced to the lodge. He had thought to pass in without ceremony as being an initiate of Chicago; but there were particular rites in Vermissa of which they were proud, and these had to be undergone by every postulant. The assembly met in a large room reserved for such purposes at the Union House. Some sixty members assembled at Vermissa; but that by no means represented the full strength of the organization, for there were several other lodges in the valley, and others across the mountains on each side, who exchanged members when any serious business was afoot, so that a crime might be done by men who were strangers to the locality. Altogether there were not less than five hundred scattered over the coal district.

在一个星期六的晚上，麦克默多被介绍到这个小屋。他原以为自己是从芝加哥来的，没有什么仪式，但是在维尔米萨有一些特殊的仪式，他们引以为豪，这些仪式必须经过每一个志愿者的历练。大会在联合大厦为此目的保留的一个大房间里举行。大约有60名成员聚集在 Vermissa，但这绝不代表这个组织的全部力量，因为在山谷里还有其他几个小屋，山的两边还有其他小屋，它们在任何严肃的事情发生时交换成员，以便当地的陌生人可以犯罪。煤区一共有不少于五百人。

In the bare assembly room the men were gathered round a long table. At the side was a second one laden with bottles and glasses, on which some members of the company were already turning their eyes. McGinty sat at the head with a flat black velvet cap upon his shock of tangled black hair, and a coloured purple stole round his neck, so that he seemed to be a priest presiding over some diabolical ritual. To right and left of him were the higher lodge officials, the cruel, handsome face of Ted Baldwin among them. Each of these wore some scarf or medallion as emblem of his office.

在空荡荡的会议室里，男人们围坐在一张长桌子旁。旁边是第二个，里面装满了瓶子和眼镜，公司里的一些人已经开始转动眼睛。麦金蒂坐在头上，一头乱蓬蓬的黑发上戴着一顶平坦的黑色天鹅绒帽子，脖子上戴着一条紫色的披肩，好像在主持某种邪恶的仪式。他的左右两边都是高级官员，其中有泰德 · 鲍德温那张残酷、英俊的面孔。他们每个人都围着一条围巾或者一个大奖章，作为他办公室的象征。

They were, for the most part, men of mature age; but the rest of the company consisted of young fellows from eighteen to twenty-five, the ready and capable agents who carried out the commands of their seniors. Among the older men were many whose features showed the tigerish, lawless souls within; but looking at the rank and file it was difficult to believe that these eager and open-faced young fellows were in very truth a dangerous gang of murderers, whose minds had suffered such complete moral perversion that they took a horrible pride in their proficiency at the business, and looked with deepest respect at the man who had the reputation of making what they called “a clean job.”

他们大部分是成年人，但其余的人都是从十八岁到二十五岁的年轻人，他们是执行长辈命令的准备充分、能干的特务。在这些年长的人中，有许多人的容貌显示出他们内心那些虎虎不驯、无法无天的灵魂; 但是看着他们的队伍，很难相信这些热心而面无表情的年轻人实际上是一伙危险的杀人犯，他们的思想遭受了彻头彻尾的道德堕落，以至于他们为自己在这一行的熟练程度感到可怕的骄傲，并且以最深的敬意看着这个有着他们所说的“干净工作”的名声的人

To their contorted natures it had become a spirited and chivalrous thing to volunteer for service against some man who had never injured them, and whom in many cases they had never seen in their lives. The crime committed, they quarrelled as to who had actually struck the fatal blow, and amused one another and the company by describing the cries and contortions of the murdered man.

对于他们扭曲的天性来说，志愿去帮助一个从未伤害过他们的人，而且在许多情况下他们一生中从未见过这样的人，已经成为一种勇敢和骑士风度的事情。他们争论到底是谁实施了这一致命的打击，并且通过描述被害人的哭喊和扭曲来取悦彼此和同伴。

At first they had shown some secrecy in their arrangements; but at the time which this narrative describes their proceedings were extraordinarily open, for the repeated failures of the law had proved to them that, on the one hand, no one would dare to witness against them, and on the other they had an unlimited number of stanch witnesses upon whom they could call, and a well-filled treasure chest from which they could draw the funds to engage the best legal talent in the state. In ten long years of outrage there had been no single conviction, and the only danger that ever threatened the Scowrers lay in the victim himself—who, however outnumbered and taken by surprise, might and occasionally did leave his mark upon his assailants.

起初，他们在安排上有些保密; 但是在这种叙述所描述的诉讼程序非常公开的时候，因为法律的一再失败已经向他们证明，一方面，没有人敢作证指控他们，另一方面，他们有无数可以传唤的冷酷的证人，和一个装满钱的宝库，他们可以从中筹集资金，雇用国内最好的法律人才。在长达10年的暴行中，没有一个人被定罪，唯一威胁到斯考勒夫妇的危险就在受害者自己身上ーー无论他们多么寡不敌众，出其不意，也许偶尔会在袭击者身上留下痕迹。

McMurdo had been warned that some ordeal lay before him; but no one would tell him in what it consisted. He was led now into an outer room by two solemn brothers. Through the plank partition he could hear the murmur of many voices from the assembly within. Once or twice he caught the sound of his own name, and he knew that they were discussing his candidacy. Then there entered an inner guard with a green and gold sash across his chest.

有人警告过麦克默多站，他面临着严峻的考验，但没有人告诉他考验的内容。他现在被两个严肃的兄弟领进一个外屋。透过木板的隔板，他可以听到里面许多人的低语声。有一两次他听到自己的名字，他知道他们在讨论他的候选人资格。然后，一个胸前挂着绿色和金色腰带的内卫进来了。

“The Bodymaster orders that he shall be trussed, blinded, and entered,” said he.

“身体主人命令，他将被捆绑，失明，并进入,”他说。

The three of them removed his coat, turned up the sleeve of his right arm, and finally passed a rope round above the elbows and made it fast. They next placed a thick black cap right over his head and the upper part of his face, so that he could see nothing. He was then led into the assembly hall.

他们三个人脱下他的外套，卷起他右臂的袖子，最后在肘部以上穿过一根绳子，把它系牢。接着，他们在他的头上和脸的上半部分戴上了一顶厚厚的黑帽子，这样他什么也看不见。然后他被带进了会议厅。

It was pitch dark and very oppressive under his hood. He heard the rustle and murmur of the people round him, and then the voice of McGinty sounded dull and distant through the covering of his ears.

他的引擎盖下一片漆黑，非常压抑。他听到周围人群的沙沙声和低语声，接着麦金蒂的声音透过他的耳朵听起来又沉闷又遥远。

“John McMurdo,” said the voice, “are you already a member of the Ancient Order of Freemen?”

“约翰 · 麦克默多,”那个声音说，“你已经是古代自由人的一员了吗?”

He bowed in assent.

他鞠躬表示同意。

“Is your lodge No. 29, Chicago?”

“你们的旅馆是29号吗，芝加哥?”

He bowed again.

他又鞠了一躬。

“Dark nights are unpleasant,” said the voice.

“黑夜是令人不快的,”那个声音说。

“Yes, for strangers to travel,” he answered.

“是的，让陌生人旅行,”他回答。

“The clouds are heavy.”

“乌云密布。”

“Yes, a storm is approaching.”

“是的，暴风雨即将来临。”

“Are the brethren satisfied?” asked the Bodymaster.

“弟兄们满意了吗?”身体大师问。

There was a general murmur of assent.

大家都低声表示同意。

“We know, Brother, by your sign and by your countersign that you are indeed one of us,” said McGinty. “We would have you know, however, that in this county and in other counties of these parts we have certain rites, and also certain duties of our own which call for good men. Are you ready to be tested?”

“我们知道，兄弟，通过你的手势和口号，你确实是我们中的一员,”麦金蒂说。“但是，我们想让你知道，在这个郡和这个地区的其他郡里，我们有一些仪式，也有一些我们自己的职责，需要好人。你准备好接受考验了吗?”

“I am.”

“是的。”

“Are you of stout heart?”

“你是个勇敢的人吗?”

“I am.”

“是的。”

“Take a stride forward to prove it.”

“向前迈一大步来证明这一点。”

As the words were said he felt two hard points in front of his eyes, pressing upon them so that it appeared as if he could not move forward without a danger of losing them. None the less, he nerved himself to step resolutely out, and as he did so the pressure melted away. There was a low murmur of applause.

说这些话的时候，他感到眼前有两个硬点压在他的眼睛上，好像他不能前进而不会有失去它们的危险。尽管如此，他还是鼓起勇气，毅然决然地走了出去，随着他这样做，压力也消失了。一阵低低的掌声。

“He is of stout heart,” said the voice. “Can you bear pain?”

“他是个勇敢的人,”那声音说，“你能忍受痛苦吗?”

“As well as another,” he answered.

“还有另外一个,”他回答。

“Test him!”

“考考他!”

It was all he could do to keep himself from screaming out, for an agonizing pain shot through his forearm. He nearly fainted at the sudden shock of it; but he bit his lip and clenched his hands to hide his agony.

他尽力不让自己尖叫出来，因为他的前臂一阵剧烈的疼痛。突如其来的打击几乎使他晕倒，但他咬着嘴唇，紧握双手以掩饰痛苦。

“I can take more than that,” said he.

“我可以承受更多,”他说。

This time there was loud applause. A finer first appearance had never been made in the lodge. Hands clapped him on the back, and the hood was plucked from his head. He stood blinking and smiling amid the congratulations of the brothers.

这一次，掌声雷动。在这个小屋里，从来没有出现过这么好的第一次。双手拍打着他的背，帽子从他的头上被扯了下来。在兄弟俩的祝贺声中，他站在那儿眨着眼睛，微笑着。

“One last word, Brother McMurdo,” said McGinty. “You have already sworn the oath of secrecy and fidelity, and you are aware that the punishment for any breach of it is instant and inevitable death?”

“最后一句话，麦克默多兄弟,”麦金蒂说。“你已经宣誓保守秘密和忠诚，你知道违背誓言的惩罚是立即和不可避免的死亡吗?”

“I am,” said McMurdo.

“是的,”麦克默多站表示。

“And you accept the rule of the Bodymaster for the time being under all circumstances?”

“你暂时在任何情况下都接受身体大师的规则吗?”

“I do.”

“我愿意。”

“Then in the name of Lodge 341, Vermissa, I welcome you to its privileges and debates. You will put the liquor on the table, Brother Scanlan, and we will drink to our worthy brother.”

”“那么，我以洛奇341，维尔米萨的名义，欢迎你参加它的特权和辩论。你把酒放在桌子上，斯坎兰兄弟，我们为我们可敬的兄弟干杯。”

McMurdo's coat had been brought to him; but before putting it on he examined his right arm, which still smarted heavily. There on the flesh of the forearm was a circle with a triangle within it, deep and red, as the branding iron had left it. One or two of his neighbours pulled up their sleeves and showed their own lodge marks.

麦克默多站的外套已经送到他面前，但在穿上之前，他检查了自己的右臂，右臂仍然疼得厉害。在前臂的肉上有一个圆圈，里面有一个三角形，深红色，因为烙铁已经离开了它。他的一两个邻居卷起袖子，露出了他们自己的小屋标记。

“We've all had it,” said one; “but not all as brave as you over it.”

“我们都经历过,”其中一个说，“但并不是所有人都像你一样勇敢。”

“Tut! It was nothing,” said he; but it burned and ached all the same.

“啧! 没什么,”他说，但它仍然在燃烧和疼痛。

When the drinks which followed the ceremony of initiation had all been disposed of, the business of the lodge proceeded. McMurdo, accustomed only to the prosaic performances of Chicago, listened with open ears and more surprise than he ventured to show to what followed.

入会仪式之后的饮料全部处理完毕之后，旅馆的事情就开始了。麦克默多站只习惯于芝加哥那种平淡无奇的表演，他听得津津有味，带着惊讶之情，而不是大胆地向人们展示接下来的表演。

“The first business on the agenda paper,” said McGinty, “is to read the following letter from Division Master Windle of Merton County Lodge 249. He says:

“议程上的第一件事,”麦金蒂说，“是阅读下面这封来自 Merton County Lodge 249师长温德尔的信。他表示:

“Dear Sir:

“亲爱的先生:

“There is a job to be done on Andrew Rae of Rae & Sturmash, coal owners near this place. You will remember that your lodge owes us a return, having had the service of two brethren in the matter of the patrolman last fall. You will send two good men, they will be taken charge of by Treasurer Higgins of this lodge, whose address you know. He will show them when to act and where. Yours in freedom,

“雷和斯特马什公司(Rae & Sturmash)的安德鲁•雷(Andrew Rae)有一项工作要做，他是这个地方附近的煤矿主。你们应该记得，你们的小屋在去年秋天因为巡警的事，雇用了两个兄弟，所以欠我们一个回报。你们要派两个好人来，他们将由这个分会的司库希金斯负责，你们知道他们的地址。他会告诉他们何时何地采取行动。你的自由,

“J. W. Windle D. M. A. O. F.

“ J.W.Windle D.M.O.f.”。

“Windle has never refused us when we have had occasion to ask for the loan of a man or two, and it is not for us to refuse him.” McGinty paused and looked round the room with his dull, malevolent eyes. “Who will volunteer for the job?”

“当我们需要借一两个人的时候，温德尔从来没有拒绝过我们，我们也不能拒绝他。”麦金蒂停了下来，用他那双迟钝而恶毒的眼睛环顾了一下房间。“谁愿意做这项工作?”

Several young fellows held up their hands. The Bodymaster looked at them with an approving smile.

几个小伙子举起了手，身体大师带着赞许的微笑看着他们。

“You'll do, Tiger Cormac. If you handle it as well as you did the last, you won't be wrong. And you, Wilson.”

“没问题，泰格 · 科马克。如果你能像上次那样处理好，你就不会错。还有你，威尔逊。”

“I've no pistol,” said the volunteer, a mere boy in his teens.

“我没有手枪,”志愿者说，他只是个十几岁的小男孩。

“It's your first, is it not? Well, you have to be blooded some time. It will be a great start for you. As to the pistol, you'll find it waiting for you, or I'm mistaken. If you report yourselves on Monday, it will be time enough. You'll get a great welcome when you return.”

“这是你的第一次，不是吗？总有一天你会热血沸腾的。这对你来说是一个很好的开始。至于手枪，你会发现它在等着你，或者我弄错了。如果你们星期一报到，时间就足够了。你回来的时候会受到热烈欢迎的。”

“Any reward this time?” asked Cormac, a thick-set, dark-faced, brutal-looking young man, whose ferocity had earned him the nickname of “Tiger.”

“这次有奖励吗?”科马克问道，他是一个身材魁梧、面色黝黑、长相凶残的年轻人，他的凶猛为他赢得了“老虎”的绰号

“Never mind the reward. You just do it for the honour of the thing. Maybe when it is done there will be a few odd dollars at the bottom of the box.”

“不用担心奖励。你这样做只是为了这件事的荣誉。也许当这一切结束时，盒子底部会有几块零钱。”

“What has the man done?” asked young Wilson.

“这个人做了什么?”年轻的威尔逊问。

“Sure, it's not for the likes of you to ask what the man has done. He has been judged over there. That's no business of ours. All we have to do is to carry it out for them, same as they would for us. Speaking of that, two brothers from the Merton lodge are coming over to us next week to do some business in this quarter.”

“当然，像你这样的人不应该问这个人做了什么。他在那里受到了审判。这不关我们的事。我们所要做的就是帮助他们，就像他们帮助我们一样。说到这个，默顿旅馆的兄弟俩下周要来我们这个季度做生意。”

“Who are they?” asked someone.

“他们是谁?”有人问。

“Faith, it is wiser not to ask. If you know nothing, you can testify nothing, and no trouble can come of it. But they are men who will make a clean job when they are about it.”

“信念，不问是更明智的。如果你什么都不知道，你就什么也不能作证，也不会有什么麻烦。但是他们是那些干净利落的人。”

“And time, too!” cried Ted Baldwin. “Folk are gettin' out of hand in these parts. It was only last week that three of our men were turned off by Foreman Blaker. It's been owing him a long time, and he'll get it full and proper.”

“还有时间!”特德 · 鲍德温喊道。“在这些地方，人们已经失控了。就在上个星期，我们的三个人被工头布莱克拒绝了。这已经欠他很长时间了，他会得到充分而适当的回报的。”

“Get what?” McMurdo whispered to his neighbour.

“得到什么?”麦克默多低声对他的邻居说。

“The business end of a buckshot cartridge!” cried the man with a loud laugh. “What think you of our ways, Brother?”

“大号铅弹的弹头!”那人大笑着说。“你觉得我们的方式怎么样，兄弟?”

McMurdo's criminal soul seemed to have already absorbed the spirit of the vile association of which he was now a member. “I like it well,” said he. “'Tis a proper place for a lad of mettle.”

麦克默多站的犯罪分子似乎已经吸收了他现在加入的这个邪恶组织的精神。“我很喜欢,”他说。“这是一个适合勇敢的小伙子的地方。”

Several of those who sat around heard his words and applauded them.

一些围坐在旁边的人听到他的话，为他鼓掌。

“What's that?” cried the black-maned Bodymaster from the end of the table.

“那是什么?”坐在桌子一头的黑发健身教练喊道。

“'Tis our new brother, sir, who finds our ways to his taste.”

“这是我们的新兄弟，先生，他找到了符合他口味的方法。”

McMurdo rose to his feet for an instant. “I would say, Eminent Bodymaster, that if a man should be wanted I should take it as an honour to be chosen to help the lodge.”

麦克默多站了一会儿。“我想说，杰出的健身大师，如果需要一个人，我会把被选中来帮助这个小组当作一种荣誉。”

There was great applause at this. It was felt that a new sun was pushing its rim above the horizon. To some of the elders it seemed that the progress was a little too rapid.

观众为此鼓掌。人们感到一个新的太阳正在把它的边缘推出地平线。对于一些老年人来说，这种进步似乎有点太快了。

“I would move,” said the secretary, Harraway, a vulture-faced old graybeard who sat near the chairman, “that Brother McMurdo should wait until it is the good pleasure of the lodge to employ him.”

“我会提议,”坐在主席身边的哈拉韦秘书说，“麦克默多兄弟应该等到旅馆很乐意雇用他的时候。”哈拉韦是一位秃鹰脸的老灰胡子

“Sure, that was what I meant; I'm in your hands,” said McMurdo.

“当然，我就是这个意思; 我在你的手中,”麦克默多站说。

“Your time will come, Brother,” said the chairman. “We have marked you down as a willing man, and we believe that you will do good work in these parts. There is a small matter to-night in which you may take a hand if it so please you.”

“你的时代会到来的，兄弟,”主席说。我们已经记录你是一个自愿的人，我们相信你会在这些地方做好工作。今天晚上有件小事，如果你愿意的话，可以帮我一把。”

“I will wait for something that is worth while.”

“我会等待一些值得的东西。”

“You can come to-night, anyhow, and it will help you to know what we stand for in this community. I will make the announcement later. Meanwhile,” he glanced at his agenda paper, “I have one or two more points to bring before the meeting. First of all, I will ask the treasurer as to our bank balance. There is the pension to Jim Carnaway's widow. He was struck down doing the work of the lodge, and it is for us to see that she is not the loser.”

“不管怎样，你今晚可以来，这将有助于你了解我们在这个社区里代表什么。我稍后会发表声明。与此同时,”他扫了一眼他的议程文件，“我还有一两点要在会议之前提出来。首先，我会向财务主管询问我们的银行存款余额。这是吉姆 · 卡纳韦的遗孀的抚恤金。他是因为做旅馆的工作而被击倒的，我们应该看到她不是失败者。”

“Jim was shot last month when they tried to kill Chester Wilcox of Marley Creek,” McMurdo's neighbour informed him.

“吉姆是在上个月他们试图杀死马利溪的切斯特 · 威尔科克斯时被枪杀的,”麦克默多的邻居告诉他。

“The funds are good at the moment,” said the treasurer, with the bankbook in front of him. “The firms have been generous of late. Max Linder & Co. paid five hundred to be left alone. Walker Brothers sent in a hundred; but I took it on myself to return it and ask for five. If I do not hear by Wednesday, their winding gear may get out of order. We had to burn their breaker last year before they became reasonable. Then the West Section Coaling Company has paid its annual contribution. We have enough on hand to meet any obligations.”

“目前资金状况良好,”财务主管说，手里拿着银行存折。“这些公司最近表现得很慷慨。马克斯 · 林德公司付了500美元让他独处。沃克兄弟送来了一百个，但是我自己承担了退货的责任，要了五个。如果到星期三我还没有听到消息，他们的缠绕装置可能会出故障。去年我们不得不烧了他们的破船，他们才变得通情达理。随后，西段煤炭公司缴纳了年度会费。我们手头有足够的资金来履行任何义务。”

“What about Archie Swindon?” asked a brother.

“阿尔奇 · 斯文顿怎么样?”一个兄弟问。

“He has sold out and left the district. The old devil left a note for us to say that he had rather be a free crossing sweeper in New York than a large mine owner under the power of a ring of blackmailers. By Gar! it was as well that he made a break for it before the note reached us! I guess he won't show his face in this valley again.”

“他出卖了自己，离开了这个地区。这个老魔鬼给我们留了一张纸条，说他宁愿在纽约当一个自由的过马路的清洁工，也不愿意在一群勒索者的势力下当一个大矿主。作者: Gar！还好他在纸条到达我们手里之前逃走了！我想他再也不会在这个山谷露面了。”

An elderly, clean-shaved man with a kindly face and a good brow rose from the end of the table which faced the chairman. “Mr. Treasurer,” he asked, “may I ask who has bought the property of this man that we have driven out of the district?”

面对主席的那张桌子的一端站了起来，一个年长的，脸上光溜溜的，长相和蔼，眉毛很好看的男人。“司库先生,”他问道，“我可以问一下是谁买了这个我们已经赶出这个地区的人的财产吗?”

“Yes, Brother Morris. It has been bought by the State & Merton County Railroad Company.”

“是的，莫里斯兄弟。它已被国家和默顿县铁路公司买下。”

“And who bought the mines of Todman and of Lee that came into the market in the same way last year?”

“谁买下了去年以同样方式进入市场的托德曼和李的矿井?”

“The same company, Brother Morris.”

“同一家公司，莫里斯兄弟。”

“And who bought the ironworks of Manson and of Shuman and of Van Deher and of Atwood, which have all been given up of late?”

谁买了曼森、舒曼、范德赫和阿特伍德的铁厂，这些铁厂最近都被卖掉了

“They were all bought by the West Gilmerton General Mining Company.”

“它们都被西吉尔默顿矿业总公司(West Gilmerton General Mining Company)收购。”

“I don't see, Brother Morris,” said the chairman, “that it matters to us who buys them, since they can't carry them out of the district.”

“我不明白，莫里斯兄弟,”主席说，“谁买它们对我们来说很重要，因为它们不能把它们运出这个地区。”

“With all respect to you, Eminent Bodymaster, I think it may matter very much to us. This process has been going on now for ten long years. We are gradually driving all the small men out of trade. What is the result? We find in their places great companies like the Railroad or the General Iron, who have their directors in New York or Philadelphia, and care nothing for our threats. We can take it out of their local bosses, but it only means that others will be sent in their stead. And we are making it dangerous for ourselves. The small men could not harm us. They had not the money nor the power. So long as we did not squeeze them too dry, they would stay on under our power. But if these big companies find that we stand between them and their profits, they will spare no pains and no expense to hunt us down and bring us to court.”

“尊敬的先生，我认为这对我们非常重要。这个过程已经持续了整整十年。我们正在逐渐使所有的小人物失业。结果是什么？我们发现在他们的地方伟大的公司，像铁路公司或铁将军，他们有他们的董事在纽约或费城，并不关心我们的威胁。我们可以从他们当地的老板那里得到这个权利，但这只意味着其他人会代替他们。我们正在使它对我们自己造成危险。这些小人物伤害不了我们。他们既没有钱也没有权力。只要我们不把它们榨得太干，它们就会在我们的力量下继续存在下去。但是，如果这些大公司发现我们挡在他们和他们的利润之间，他们会不遗余力、不惜一切代价追捕我们，把我们告上法庭。”

There was a hush at these ominous words, and every face darkened as gloomy looks were exchanged. So omnipotent and unchallenged had they been that the very thought that there was possible retribution in the background had been banished from their minds. And yet the idea struck a chill to the most reckless of them.

这些不祥的话语中有一种寂静，每个人的脸都变得阴沉起来，交换着忧郁的表情。他们是如此的无所不能，无所不能，以至于他们脑子里已经没有了可能会有报应的想法。然而，这个想法让他们中最不计后果的人感到一阵寒意。

“It is my advice,” the speaker continued, “that we go easier upon the small men. On the day that they have all been driven out the power of this society will have been broken.”

“我的建议是,”演讲者继续说道，“我们应该对小人物宽容一些。当他们全部被赶走的那一天，这个社会的力量就会被打破。”

Unwelcome truths are not popular. There were angry cries as the speaker resumed his seat. McGinty rose with gloom upon his brow.

不受欢迎的事实并不受欢迎。演讲者回到座位上时发出愤怒的叫喊声。麦金蒂眉宇间阴郁地站了起来。

“Brother Morris,” said he, “you were always a croaker. So long as the members of this lodge stand together there is no power in the United States that can touch them. Sure, have we not tried it often enough in the law courts? I expect the big companies will find it easier to pay than to fight, same as the little companies do. And now, Brethren,” McGinty took off his black velvet cap and his stole as he spoke, “this lodge has finished its business for the evening, save for one small matter which may be mentioned when we are parting. The time has now come for fraternal refreshment and for harmony.”

“莫里斯兄弟,”他说，“你总是个黄鱼。只要这个小组的成员们站在一起，在美国就没有任何力量可以触及他们。当然，难道我们在法庭上还没有足够频繁地尝试过吗？我希望大公司能像小公司一样，发现支付比战斗更容易。“现在，弟兄们,”麦金蒂一面说，一面脱下他的黑天鹅绒帽子和披肩，“这个小屋今晚的活动已经结束了，只有一件小事可以在我们分别时提到。现在是兄弟一心，和睦相处的时候了。”

Strange indeed is human nature. Here were these men, to whom murder was familiar, who again and again had struck down the father of the family, some man against whom they had no personal feeling, without one thought of compunction or of compassion for his weeping wife or helpless children, and yet the tender or pathetic in music could move them to tears. McMurdo had a fine tenor voice, and if he had failed to gain the good will of the lodge before, it could no longer have been withheld after he had thrilled them with “I'm Sitting on the Stile, Mary,” and “On the Banks of Allan Water.”

人的本性真是奇怪。这些人，他们熟悉谋杀，一次又一次地杀害了家里的父亲，这些人对他们没有个人感情，对他哭泣的妻子或无助的孩子没有丝毫的内疚或怜悯，然而音乐中的温柔或悲哀却能使他们落泪。麦克默多有着优美的男高音嗓音，如果他之前没有赢得旅馆的好感，那么在他用“我坐在 Stile 上，玛丽”和“在艾伦河岸上”激励他们之后，这种好感就不可能再被抑制了

In his very first night the new recruit had made himself one of the most popular of the brethren, marked already for advancement and high office. There were other qualities needed, however, besides those of good fellowship, to make a worthy Freeman, and of these he was given an example before the evening was over. The whisky bottle had passed round many times, and the men were flushed and ripe for mischief when their Bodymaster rose once more to address them.

在第一天晚上，这个新成员就使自己成为同胞中最受欢迎的一个，已经有了晋升和高级职位的标志。然而，要成为一个有价值的弗里曼，除了要有良好的友谊，还需要其他的品质。威士忌酒瓶已经转了好几圈了，当他们的贴身主人再次站起来对他们说话时，他们的脸都红了，准备调皮捣蛋了。

“Boys,” said he, “there's one man in this town that wants trimming up, and it's for you to see that he gets it. I'm speaking of James Stanger of the Herald. You've seen how he's been opening his mouth against us again?”

“孩子们,”他说，“这个镇上有一个人要修剪，你们应该看看他是否做到了。我说的是《先驱报》的詹姆斯 · 斯坦格。你看到他又开始跟我们对着干了吗?”

There was a murmur of assent, with many a muttered oath. McGinty took a slip of paper from his waistcoat pocket.

人们低声表示同意，许多人低声咒骂。麦金蒂从背心口袋里掏出一张纸条。

Law and Order!

法律与秩序！

That's how he heads it.

他就是这么领导的。

“Reign of terror in the coal and iron district

“煤铁区的恐怖统治

“Twelve years have now elapsed since the first assassinations which proved the existence of a criminal organization in our midst. From that day these outrages have never ceased, until now they have reached a pitch which makes us the opprobrium of the civilized world. Is it for such results as this that our great country welcomes to its bosom the alien who flies from the despotisms of Europe? Is it that they shall themselves become tyrants over the very men who have given them shelter, and that a state of terrorism and lawlessness should be established under the very shadow of the sacred folds of the starry Flag of Freedom which would raise horror in our minds if we read of it as existing under the most effete monarchy of the East? The men are known. The organization is patent and public. How long are we to endure it? Can we forever live—

“自从第一次暗杀事件证明我们中间存在一个犯罪组织以来，已经过去了12年。从那天起，这些暴行就没有停止过，直到现在，它们达到了一种程度，使我们成为文明世界的耻辱。难道我们伟大的国家就是为了这样的结果而欢迎从欧洲的专制统治下逃走的外国人？难道他们自己会成为那些庇护他们的人的暴君，恐怖主义和无法无天的状态应该建立在星光灿烂的自由旗帜的神圣褶皱的阴影之下，如果我们把它看作是存在于东方最衰弱的君主制之下，这会在我们心中引起恐惧吗？这些男人是众所周知的。这个组织是专利和公共的。我们还要忍受多久？我们能永远活下去吗

Sure, I've read enough of the slush!“ cried the chairman, tossing the paper down upon the table. ”That's what he says of us. The question I'm asking you is what shall we say to him?“

当然，我已经读了足够多的废话！”主席叫道，把报纸扔在桌子上”他就是这么说我们的。我问你的问题是我们该对他说什么？“

“Kill him!” cried a dozen fierce voices.

“杀了他!”十几个凶狠的声音喊道。

“I protest against that,” said Brother Morris, the man of the good brow and shaved face. “I tell you, Brethren, that our hand is too heavy in this valley, and that there will come a point where in self-defense every man will unite to crush us out. James Stanger is an old man. He is respected in the township and the district. His paper stands for all that is solid in the valley. If that man is struck down, there will be a stir through this state that will only end with our destruction.”

“我对此表示抗议,”莫里斯兄弟说，他眉毛很好，脸刮得很干净。“弟兄们，我告诉你们，在这个山谷里，我们的手太重了，总有一天，为了自卫，每个人都会联合起来，把我们赶尽杀绝。詹姆斯 · 斯坦格是个老人。他在镇上和区里都很受人尊敬。他的论文代表了山谷中所有坚实的东西。如果那个人被击倒，这个国家就会掀起一场骚动，结果只会是我们的毁灭。”

“And how would they bring about our destruction, Mr. Standback?” cried McGinty. “Is it by the police? Sure, half of them are in our pay and half of them afraid of us. Or is it by the law courts and the judge? Haven't we tried that before now, and what ever came of it?”

“他们怎么会毁了我们呢，斯丹巴克先生?”麦金蒂喊道。”“是警察吗？当然，他们一半是我们的人，一半是怕我们的人。还是由法庭和法官决定？我们以前没有试过吗? 结果呢?”

“There is a Judge Lynch that might try the case,” said Brother Morris.

“有一个法官林奇可能会审理这个案件,”莫里斯说。

A general shout of anger greeted the suggestion.

这个建议引起了一片愤怒的叫喊声。

“I have but to raise my finger,” cried McGinty, “and I could put two hundred men into this town that would clear it out from end to end.” Then suddenly raising his voice and bending his huge black brows into a terrible frown, “See here, Brother Morris, I have my eye on you, and have had for some time! You've no heart yourself, and you try to take the heart out of others. It will be an ill day for you, Brother Morris, when your own name comes on our agenda paper, and I'm thinking that it's just there that I ought to place it.”

“我只要举起我的手指,”麦金蒂大声说，“我就可以派两百人进入这个镇子，把它从头到尾清理干净。”突然，他提高了嗓门，皱起了他那巨大的黑眉头，皱起了可怕的眉头: “看这儿，莫里斯兄弟，我盯着你看，已经有一段时间了！你自己没有心，你试图把别人的心挖出来。莫里斯兄弟，如果你的名字出现在我们的议事日程上，那将是你倒霉的一天，我想我应该把它放在那里。”

Morris had turned deadly pale, and his knees seemed to give way under him as he fell back into his chair. He raised his glass in his trembling hand and drank before he could answer. “I apologize, Eminent Bodymaster, to you and to every brother in this lodge if I have said more than I should. I am a faithful member—you all know that—and it is my fear lest evil come to the lodge which makes me speak in anxious words. But I have greater trust in your judgment than in my own, Eminent Bodymaster, and I promise you that I will not offend again.”

莫里斯的脸色苍白得要命，当他倒在椅子上时，膝盖似乎塌了下来。他用颤抖的手举起酒杯，还没来得及回答就喝了起来。“尊敬的健身大师，如果我说得太多，我向你和这个小屋里的每一位兄弟道歉。我是一个忠实的会员ーー你们都知道ーー我害怕邪恶来到会所，这使我说起话来焦虑不安。但是我更相信你的判断力，而不是我自己的判断力，我向你保证，我不会再犯了。”

The Bodymaster's scowl relaxed as he listened to the humble words. “Very good, Brother Morris. It's myself that would be sorry if it were needful to give you a lesson. But so long as I am in this chair we shall be a united lodge in word and in deed. And now, boys,” he continued, looking round at the company, “I'll say this much, that if Stanger got his full deserts there would be more trouble than we need ask for. These editors hang together, and every journal in the state would be crying out for police and troops. But I guess you can give him a pretty severe warning. Will you fix it, Brother Baldwin?”

听到这些谦卑的话语，身体大师的怒容消失了。“很好，莫里斯兄弟。如果有必要给你上一课的话，我自己才会感到抱歉。但是只要我还在这个位子上，我们就会在言行上团结一致。“现在，孩子们,”他环顾四周，继续说道，“我要说的是，如果斯坦格得到应有的惩罚，麻烦就会比我们所需要的更多。这些编辑团结在一起，这个州的每一份杂志都会呼吁警察和军队的到来。但我想你可以给他一个相当严厉的警告。你能修好它吗，鲍德温修士?”

“Sure!” said the young man eagerly.

“当然!”年轻人急切地说。

“How many will you take?”

“你要吃多少?”

“Half a dozen, and two to guard the door. You'll come, Gower, and you, Mansel, and you, Scanlan, and the two Willabys.”

”“六个，两个看门。你会来的，高尔，你，曼塞尔，你，斯坎兰，还有两个威拉比。”

“I promised the new brother he should go,” said the chairman.

“我答应新来的兄弟他应该去,”主席说。

Ted Baldwin looked at McMurdo with eyes which showed that he had not forgotten nor forgiven. “Well, he can come if he wants,” he said in a surly voice. “That's enough. The sooner we get to work the better.”

特德•鲍德温(Ted Baldwin)看着麦克默多站的眼神表明，他既没有忘记，也没有原谅。“好吧，如果他愿意，他可以来,”他用粗暴的声音说。“够了。我们越早开始工作越好。”

The company broke up with shouts and yells and snatches of drunken song. The bar was still crowded with revellers, and many of the brethren remained there. The little band who had been told off for duty passed out into the street, proceeding in twos and threes along the sidewalk so as not to provoke attention. It was a bitterly cold night, with a half-moon shining brilliantly in a frosty, star-spangled sky. The men stopped and gathered in a yard which faced a high building. The words “Vermissa Herald” were printed in gold lettering between the brightly lit windows. From within came the clanking of the printing press.

这个连队在一片叫喊声和断断续续的醉歌声中解散了。酒吧里仍然挤满了寻欢作乐的人，许多弟兄们还留在那里。那个被叫去值班的小乐队三三两两地沿着人行道走到街上，以免引起别人的注意。那是一个寒冷刺骨的夜晚，半月在结霜的星光灿烂的天空中闪耀着光芒。男人们停下来，聚集在一个院子里，院子对着一座高楼。在明亮的窗户之间，用金色的字体印着“先驱者 Vermissa”。从里面传来了印刷机的叮当声。

“Here, you,” said Baldwin to McMurdo, “you can stand below at the door and see that the road is kept open for us. Arthur Willaby can stay with you. You others come with me. Have no fears, boys; for we have a dozen witnesses that we are in the Union Bar at this very moment.”

“喂，你,”鲍德温对麦克默多站说，“你可以站在下面的门口，看看路是不是为我们敞开的。亚瑟 · 威拉比可以和你一起住。你们其他人跟我来。孩子们，不要害怕，因为我们有十几个证人可以证明此时此刻我们正在联合律师协会里。”

It was nearly midnight, and the street was deserted save for one or two revellers upon their way home. The party crossed the road, and, pushing open the door of the newspaper office, Baldwin and his men rushed in and up the stair which faced them. McMurdo and another remained below. From the room above came a shout, a cry for help, and then the sound of trampling feet and of falling chairs. An instant later a gray-haired man rushed out on the landing.

快到午夜了，街上空无一人，只有一两个人在回家的路上寻欢作乐。一行人穿过马路，推开报社的门，鲍德温和他的手下冲了进来，爬上了面对他们的楼梯。麦克默多站和另一个仍在下面。从楼上的房间传来一声呼喊，一声求救，然后是脚步踩踏和椅子倒下的声音。过了一会儿，楼梯平台上跑出来一个头发花白的人。

He was seized before he could get farther, and his spectacles came tinkling down to McMurdo's feet. There was a thud and a groan. He was on his face, and half a dozen sticks were clattering together as they fell upon him. He writhed, and his long, thin limbs quivered under the blows. The others ceased at last; but Baldwin, his cruel face set in an infernal smile, was hacking at the man's head, which he vainly endeavoured to defend with his arms. His white hair was dabbled with patches of blood. Baldwin was still stooping over his victim, putting in a short, vicious blow whenever he could see a part exposed, when McMurdo dashed up the stair and pushed him back.

他还没走多远就被抓住了，他的眼镜叮叮当当地落到了麦克默多站的脚下。砰的一声，一声呻吟。他倒在地上，六根棍子砸在他身上发出咔哒咔哒的声音。他扭动着，瘦长的四肢在打击下颤抖着。其他人最后都停了下来，但是鲍德温那张残忍的脸上露出恶毒的微笑，正在砍那个人的头，他徒劳地用手臂试图保护他的头。他的白发上沾满了血迹。当麦克默多站冲上楼梯把他推回去的时候，Baldwin 仍然俯身在他的受害者身上，只要看到一个部分露出来，他就会狠狠地给他一拳。

“You'll kill the man,” said he. “Drop it!”

“你会杀了那个人的,”他说，“放下枪!”

Baldwin looked at him in amazement. “Curse you!” he cried. “Who are you to interfere—you that are new to the lodge? Stand back!” He raised his stick; but McMurdo had whipped his pistol out of his hip pocket.

鲍德温惊讶地看着他。“诅咒你!”他哭了起来。”“你是谁? 你是新来的吗？退后!”他举起手杖，但是麦克默多已经从他的屁股口袋里掏出了手枪。

“Stand back yourself!” he cried. “I'll blow your face in if you lay a hand on me. As to the lodge, wasn't it the order of the Bodymaster that the man was not to be killed—and what are you doing but killing him?”

“你自己往后站!”他哭了起来。“如果你敢碰我，我就打爆你的脸。至于那个小屋，那个人不应该被杀死，这不是肉身大师的命令吗? 除了杀死他，你还在干什么?”

“It's truth he says,” remarked one of the men.

“他说的是实话,”其中一个人说。

“By Gar! you'd best hurry yourselves!” cried the man below. “The windows are all lighting up, and you'll have the whole town here inside of five minutes.”

“以加尔之名！你们最好快点!”楼下的人喊道。“所有的窗户都亮起来了，五分钟之内你就可以看到整个城市了。”

There was indeed the sound of shouting in the street, and a little group of compositors and pressmen was forming in the hall below and nerving itself to action. Leaving the limp and motionless body of the editor at the head of the stair, the criminals rushed down and made their way swiftly along the street. Having reached the Union House, some of them mixed with the crowd in McGinty's saloon, whispering across the bar to the Boss that the job had been well carried through. Others, and among them McMurdo, broke away into side streets, and so by devious paths to their own homes.

街上的确有叫喊声，楼下的大厅里正聚集着一小群排字工人和印刷工人，他们正鼓起勇气采取行动。罪犯们把编辑那软弱无力、一动不动的身子留在楼梯口，冲下楼来，沿着街道迅速地走着。到了联合大厦后，有些人混在麦金蒂酒吧里的人群中，在吧台对老板耳语，说这项工作完成得很好。其他人，其中包括麦克默多，则从小路逃到他们自己的家里。

Chapter III. Lodge 341, Vermissa Chapter III.

第三章，洛奇第三百四十一章，第三章。

Lodge 341, Vermissa

341 Lodge，Vermissa

On the day following the evening which had contained so many exciting events, McMurdo moved his lodgings from old Jacob Shafter's and took up his quarters at the Widow MacNamara's on the extreme outskirts of the town. Scanlan, his original acquaintance aboard the train, had occasion shortly afterwards to move into Vermissa, and the two lodged together. There was no other boarder, and the hostess was an easy-going old Irishwoman who left them to themselves; so that they had a freedom for speech and action welcome to men who had secrets in common.

第二天晚上，发生了许多激动人心的事情，麦克默多从老雅各布 · 沙福特那里搬了出来，住进了镇子最边缘的麦克纳马拉寡妇那里。他最初在火车上认识的斯坎兰不久就搬到了 Vermissa，两人住在了一起。没有其他的寄宿者，女主人是一个随和的爱尔兰老妇人，把他们留给了自己; 因此他们有言论和行动的自由，欢迎有共同秘密的男人。

Shafter had relented to the extent of letting McMurdo come to his meals there when he liked; so that his intercourse with Ettie was by no means broken. On the contrary, it drew closer and more intimate as the weeks went by.

沙夫特已经让步，允许麦克默多在他喜欢的时候到那里吃饭，所以他和埃蒂的交往并没有中断。相反，随着时间的推移，它变得越来越亲密。

In his bedroom at his new abode McMurdo felt it safe to take out the coining moulds, and under many a pledge of secrecy a number of brothers from the lodge were allowed to come in and see them, each carrying away in his pocket some examples of the false money, so cunningly struck that there was never the slightest difficulty or danger in passing it. Why, with such a wonderful art at his command, McMurdo should condescend to work at all was a perpetual mystery to his companions; though he made it clear to anyone who asked him that if he lived without any visible means it would very quickly bring the police upon his track.

在麦克默多新居的卧室里，他觉得拿出铸币模具是安全的，而且在许多保密的承诺下，旅馆的一些兄弟被允许进来看他们，每个人口袋里都装着一些假币的样品，巧妙地敲打着，以至于传递假币从来没有任何困难或危险。为什么在他掌握如此精湛的艺术之后，麦克默多站居然屈尊去工作，这对他的同伴来说是一个永恒的谜团; 尽管他向任何问他是否生活在没有任何可见手段的情况下，很快警察就会找到他的踪迹。

One policeman was indeed after him already; but the incident, as luck would have it, did the adventurer a great deal more good than harm. After the first introduction there were few evenings when he did not find his way to McGinty's saloon, there to make closer acquaintance with “the boys,” which was the jovial title by which the dangerous gang who infested the place were known to one another. His dashing manner and fearlessness of speech made him a favourite with them all; while the rapid and scientific way in which he polished off his antagonist in an “all in” bar-room scrap earned the respect of that rough community. Another incident, however, raised him even higher in their estimation.

确实已经有一个警察在追捕他了，但是这次事故，幸运的是，对这个冒险家来说，利大于弊。第一次见面之后，有几个晚上，他没有找到去麦金蒂酒吧的路，而是去那里和“孩子们”更近一些，这是一个愉快的称呼，那个危险的团伙出没在那个地方，他们互相认识。他勇猛的举止和无畏的言谈使他受到大家的喜爱，而他在一个“全能”的酒吧间小打小闹中迅速而科学地消灭对手的方式赢得了这个粗野的社会的尊敬。然而，另一件事使他在他们的评价中更高了。

Just at the crowded hour one night, the door opened and a man entered with the quiet blue uniform and peaked cap of the mine police. This was a special body raised by the railways and colliery owners to supplement the efforts of the ordinary civil police, who were perfectly helpless in the face of the organized ruffianism which terrorized the district. There was a hush as he entered, and many a curious glance was cast at him; but the relations between policemen and criminals are peculiar in some parts of the States, and McGinty himself standing behind his counter, showed no surprise when the policeman enrolled himself among his customers.

一天晚上，就在这个拥挤的时刻，门开了，一个男人走了进来，他穿着安静的蓝色制服，戴着矿警的尖顶帽。这是铁路和煤矿业主设立的一个专门机构，以补充普通民警的努力，他们在面对有组织的暴徒恐吓该地区时完全无能为力。但是在美国的一些地方，警察和罪犯之间的关系是特殊的，麦金蒂本人站在柜台后面，当警察把自己列入他的顾客之中时，并没有表现出惊讶。

“A straight whisky, for the night is bitter,” said the police officer. “I don't think we have met before, Councillor?”

“要一杯纯威士忌，因为晚上喝是苦的,”警察说，“我想我们以前没有见过面吧，议员?”

“You'll be the new captain?” said McGinty.

“你将成为新的船长?”麦金蒂说。

“That's so. We're looking to you, Councillor, and to the other leading citizens, to help us in upholding law and order in this township. Captain Marvin is my name.”

“没错。我们期待着你，议员，和其他主要市民，帮助我们维护这个镇的法律和秩序。我叫马文船长。”

“We'd do better without you, Captain Marvin,” said McGinty coldly; “for we have our own police of the township, and no need for any imported goods. What are you but the paid tool of the capitalists, hired by them to club or shoot your poorer fellow citizen?”

“没有你，我们会过得更好，马文队长,”麦金蒂冷冷地说，“因为我们镇上有自己的警察，不需要任何进口货物。你只不过是资本家雇来打棒球或射杀穷人的有偿工具罢了。”

“Well, well, we won't argue about that,” said the police officer good-humouredly. “I expect we all do our duty same as we see it; but we can't all see it the same.” He had drunk off his glass and had turned to go, when his eyes fell upon the face of Jack McMurdo, who was scowling at his elbow. “Hullo! Hullo!” he cried, looking him up and down. “Here's an old acquaintance!”

“好吧，好吧，我们不争论这个问题,”警官和颜悦色地说。“我希望我们所有人都能按照自己的看法履行自己的职责，但我们的看法不可能完全一致。”他喝光了杯子里的酒，转身要走，这时他的目光落到了杰克 · 麦克默多的脸上，他的眼睛在他的胳膊肘旁皱着眉头。“喂！你好!”他哭了，上下打量着他。“老熟人来了!”

McMurdo shrank away from him. “I was never a friend to you nor any other cursed copper in my life,” said he.

麦克默多躲开了他。“在我的一生中，我从来都不是你的朋友，也不是任何一个被诅咒的警察,”他说。

“An acquaintance isn't always a friend,” said the police captain, grinning. “You're Jack McMurdo of Chicago, right enough, and don't you deny it!”

“熟人并不总是朋友,”警察队长咧嘴笑着说。“你是芝加哥的杰克 · 麦克默多，对极了，别否认!”

McMurdo shrugged his shoulders. “I'm not denying it,” said he. “D'ye think I'm ashamed of my own name?”

麦克默多耸了耸肩。“我不否认,”他说。“你认为我为自己的名字感到羞耻吗?”

“You've got good cause to be, anyhow.”

“不管怎么说，你有充分的理由生气。”

“What the devil d'you mean by that?” he roared with his fists clenched.

“你这话是什么意思?”他紧握着拳头吼道。

“No, no, Jack, bluster won't do with me. I was an officer in Chicago before ever I came to this darned coal bunker, and I know a Chicago crook when I see one.”

“不，不，杰克，吓唬我是不行的。在我来到这个该死的煤仓之前，我是芝加哥的一名警官，我一眼就认出了一个芝加哥的骗子。”

McMurdo's face fell. “Don't tell me that you're Marvin of the Chicago Central!” he cried.

“别告诉我你是《芝加哥中央报》的马文!”他哭了。

“Just the same old Teddy Marvin, at your service. We haven't forgotten the shooting of Jonas Pinto up there.”

“还是老样子的泰迪 · 马文，听候差遣。我们没有忘记乔纳斯 · 平托在那里被枪杀的事。”

“I never shot him.”

“我从没开枪打过他。”

“Did you not? That's good impartial evidence, ain't it? Well, his death came in uncommon handy for you, or they would have had you for shoving the queer. Well, we can let that be bygones; for, between you and me—and perhaps I'm going further than my duty in saying it—they could get no clear case against you, and Chicago's open to you to-morrow.”

”“不是吗？这是很好的公正证据，不是吗？好吧，他的死对你来说不是什么好事，否则他们早就把你当同性恋了。那么，我们就让这件事过去吧，因为，在你我之间——也许我说这些话超出了我的职责范围——他们对你没有明确的指控，芝加哥明天就对你敞开大门。”

“I'm very well where I am.”

“我现在感觉很好。”

“Well, I've given you the pointer, and you're a sulky dog not to thank me for it.”

“好吧，我已经给了你一个指示器，而你是一只生气的狗，不感谢我。”

“Well, I suppose you mean well, and I do thank you,” said McMurdo in no very gracious manner.

“好吧，我想你是出于好意，我真的很感谢你,”麦克默多站没有什么风度地说。

“It's mum with me so long as I see you living on the straight,” said the captain. “But, by the Lord! if you get off after this, it's another story! So good-night to you—and goodnight, Councillor.”

“只要我看到你一直生活在正道上，我就不会怪我妈,”船长说。”“但是，以主的名义！如果你在这之后下车，那就是另一个故事了！晚安，晚安，议员。”

He left the bar-room; but not before he had created a local hero. McMurdo's deeds in far Chicago had been whispered before. He had put off all questions with a smile, as one who did not wish to have greatness thrust upon him. But now the thing was officially confirmed. The bar loafers crowded round him and shook him heartily by the hand. He was free of the community from that time on. He could drink hard and show little trace of it; but that evening, had his mate Scanlan not been at hand to lead him home, the feted hero would surely have spent his night under the bar.

他离开了酒吧间，但是在那之前，他已经创造了一个当地的英雄。麦克默多站在遥远的芝加哥的所作所为以前也曾被人议论过。他微笑着回避了所有的问题，就像一个不希望伟大强加于他身上的人一样。但是现在这件事被官方证实了。酒吧里的流浪汉围着他，热情地握着他的手。从那时起，他就脱离了这个社区。但是那天晚上，如果他的伙伴斯坎兰不在身边带他回家，这位受人尊敬的英雄肯定会在吧台下度过他的夜晚。

On a Saturday night McMurdo was introduced to the lodge. He had thought to pass in without ceremony as being an initiate of Chicago; but there were particular rites in Vermissa of which they were proud, and these had to be undergone by every postulant. The assembly met in a large room reserved for such purposes at the Union House. Some sixty members assembled at Vermissa; but that by no means represented the full strength of the organization, for there were several other lodges in the valley, and others across the mountains on each side, who exchanged members when any serious business was afoot, so that a crime might be done by men who were strangers to the locality. Altogether there were not less than five hundred scattered over the coal district.

在一个星期六的晚上，麦克默多被介绍到这个小屋。他原以为自己是从芝加哥来的，没有什么仪式，但是在维尔米萨有一些特殊的仪式，他们引以为豪，这些仪式必须经过每一个志愿者的历练。大会在联合大厦为此目的保留的一个大房间里举行。大约有60名成员聚集在 Vermissa，但这绝不代表这个组织的全部力量，因为在山谷里还有其他几个小屋，山的两边还有其他小屋，它们在任何严肃的事情发生时交换成员，以便当地的陌生人可以犯罪。煤区一共有不少于五百人。

In the bare assembly room the men were gathered round a long table. At the side was a second one laden with bottles and glasses, on which some members of the company were already turning their eyes. McGinty sat at the head with a flat black velvet cap upon his shock of tangled black hair, and a coloured purple stole round his neck, so that he seemed to be a priest presiding over some diabolical ritual. To right and left of him were the higher lodge officials, the cruel, handsome face of Ted Baldwin among them. Each of these wore some scarf or medallion as emblem of his office.

在空荡荡的会议室里，男人们围坐在一张长桌子旁。旁边是第二个，里面装满了瓶子和眼镜，公司里的一些人已经开始转动眼睛。麦金蒂坐在头上，一头乱蓬蓬的黑发上戴着一顶平坦的黑色天鹅绒帽子，脖子上戴着一条紫色的披肩，好像在主持某种邪恶的仪式。他的左右两边都是高级官员，其中有泰德 · 鲍德温那张残酷、英俊的面孔。他们每个人都围着一条围巾或者一个大奖章，作为他办公室的象征。

They were, for the most part, men of mature age; but the rest of the company consisted of young fellows from eighteen to twenty-five, the ready and capable agents who carried out the commands of their seniors. Among the older men were many whose features showed the tigerish, lawless souls within; but looking at the rank and file it was difficult to believe that these eager and open-faced young fellows were in very truth a dangerous gang of murderers, whose minds had suffered such complete moral perversion that they took a horrible pride in their proficiency at the business, and looked with deepest respect at the man who had the reputation of making what they called “a clean job.”

他们大部分是成年人，但其余的人都是从十八岁到二十五岁的年轻人，他们是执行长辈命令的准备充分、能干的特务。在这些年长的人中，有许多人的容貌显示出他们内心那些虎虎不驯、无法无天的灵魂; 但是看着他们的队伍，很难相信这些热心而面无表情的年轻人实际上是一伙危险的杀人犯，他们的思想遭受了彻头彻尾的道德堕落，以至于他们为自己在这一行的熟练程度感到可怕的骄傲，并且以最深的敬意看着这个有着他们所说的“干净工作”的名声的人

To their contorted natures it had become a spirited and chivalrous thing to volunteer for service against some man who had never injured them, and whom in many cases they had never seen in their lives. The crime committed, they quarrelled as to who had actually struck the fatal blow, and amused one another and the company by describing the cries and contortions of the murdered man.

对于他们扭曲的天性来说，志愿去帮助一个从未伤害过他们的人，而且在许多情况下他们一生中从未见过这样的人，已经成为一种勇敢和骑士风度的事情。他们争论到底是谁实施了这一致命的打击，并且通过描述被害人的哭喊和扭曲来取悦彼此和同伴。

At first they had shown some secrecy in their arrangements; but at the time which this narrative describes their proceedings were extraordinarily open, for the repeated failures of the law had proved to them that, on the one hand, no one would dare to witness against them, and on the other they had an unlimited number of stanch witnesses upon whom they could call, and a well-filled treasure chest from which they could draw the funds to engage the best legal talent in the state. In ten long years of outrage there had been no single conviction, and the only danger that ever threatened the Scowrers lay in the victim himself—who, however outnumbered and taken by surprise, might and occasionally did leave his mark upon his assailants.

起初，他们在安排上有些保密; 但是在这种叙述所描述的诉讼程序非常公开的时候，因为法律的一再失败已经向他们证明，一方面，没有人敢作证指控他们，另一方面，他们有无数可以传唤的冷酷的证人，和一个装满钱的宝库，他们可以从中筹集资金，雇用国内最好的法律人才。在长达10年的暴行中，没有一个人被定罪，唯一威胁到斯考勒夫妇的危险就在受害者自己身上ーー无论他们多么寡不敌众，出其不意，也许偶尔会在袭击者身上留下痕迹。

McMurdo had been warned that some ordeal lay before him; but no one would tell him in what it consisted. He was led now into an outer room by two solemn brothers. Through the plank partition he could hear the murmur of many voices from the assembly within. Once or twice he caught the sound of his own name, and he knew that they were discussing his candidacy. Then there entered an inner guard with a green and gold sash across his chest.

有人警告过麦克默多站，他面临着严峻的考验，但没有人告诉他考验的内容。他现在被两个严肃的兄弟领进一个外屋。透过木板的隔板，他可以听到里面许多人的低语声。有一两次他听到自己的名字，他知道他们在讨论他的候选人资格。然后，一个胸前挂着绿色和金色腰带的内卫进来了。

“The Bodymaster orders that he shall be trussed, blinded, and entered,” said he.

“身体主人命令，他将被捆绑，失明，并进入,”他说。

The three of them removed his coat, turned up the sleeve of his right arm, and finally passed a rope round above the elbows and made it fast. They next placed a thick black cap right over his head and the upper part of his face, so that he could see nothing. He was then led into the assembly hall.

他们三个人脱下他的外套，卷起他右臂的袖子，最后在肘部以上穿过一根绳子，把它系牢。接着，他们在他的头上和脸的上半部分戴上了一顶厚厚的黑帽子，这样他什么也看不见。然后他被带进了会议厅。

It was pitch dark and very oppressive under his hood. He heard the rustle and murmur of the people round him, and then the voice of McGinty sounded dull and distant through the covering of his ears.

他的引擎盖下一片漆黑，非常压抑。他听到周围人群的沙沙声和低语声，接着麦金蒂的声音透过他的耳朵听起来又沉闷又遥远。

“John McMurdo,” said the voice, “are you already a member of the Ancient Order of Freemen?”

“约翰 · 麦克默多,”那个声音说，“你已经是古代自由人的一员了吗?”

He bowed in assent.

他鞠躬表示同意。

“Is your lodge No. 29, Chicago?”

“你们的旅馆是29号吗，芝加哥?”

He bowed again.

他又鞠了一躬。

“Dark nights are unpleasant,” said the voice.

“黑夜是令人不快的,”那个声音说。

“Yes, for strangers to travel,” he answered.

“是的，让陌生人旅行,”他回答。

“The clouds are heavy.”

“乌云密布。”

“Yes, a storm is approaching.”

“是的，暴风雨即将来临。”

“Are the brethren satisfied?” asked the Bodymaster.

“弟兄们满意了吗?”身体大师问。

There was a general murmur of assent.

大家都低声表示同意。

“We know, Brother, by your sign and by your countersign that you are indeed one of us,” said McGinty. “We would have you know, however, that in this county and in other counties of these parts we have certain rites, and also certain duties of our own which call for good men. Are you ready to be tested?”

“我们知道，兄弟，通过你的手势和口号，你确实是我们中的一员,”麦金蒂说。“但是，我们想让你知道，在这个郡和这个地区的其他郡里，我们有一些仪式，也有一些我们自己的职责，需要好人。你准备好接受考验了吗?”

“I am.”

“是的。”

“Are you of stout heart?”

“你是个勇敢的人吗?”

“I am.”

“是的。”

“Take a stride forward to prove it.”

“向前迈一大步来证明这一点。”

As the words were said he felt two hard points in front of his eyes, pressing upon them so that it appeared as if he could not move forward without a danger of losing them. None the less, he nerved himself to step resolutely out, and as he did so the pressure melted away. There was a low murmur of applause.

说这些话的时候，他感到眼前有两个硬点压在他的眼睛上，好像他不能前进而不会有失去它们的危险。尽管如此，他还是鼓起勇气，毅然决然地走了出去，随着他这样做，压力也消失了。一阵低低的掌声。

“He is of stout heart,” said the voice. “Can you bear pain?”

“他是个勇敢的人,”那声音说，“你能忍受痛苦吗?”

“As well as another,” he answered.

“还有另外一个,”他回答。

“Test him!”

“考考他!”

It was all he could do to keep himself from screaming out, for an agonizing pain shot through his forearm. He nearly fainted at the sudden shock of it; but he bit his lip and clenched his hands to hide his agony.

他尽力不让自己尖叫出来，因为他的前臂一阵剧烈的疼痛。突如其来的打击几乎使他晕倒，但他咬着嘴唇，紧握双手以掩饰痛苦。

“I can take more than that,” said he.

“我可以承受更多,”他说。

This time there was loud applause. A finer first appearance had never been made in the lodge. Hands clapped him on the back, and the hood was plucked from his head. He stood blinking and smiling amid the congratulations of the brothers.

这一次，掌声雷动。在这个小屋里，从来没有出现过这么好的第一次。双手拍打着他的背，帽子从他的头上被扯了下来。在兄弟俩的祝贺声中，他站在那儿眨着眼睛，微笑着。

“One last word, Brother McMurdo,” said McGinty. “You have already sworn the oath of secrecy and fidelity, and you are aware that the punishment for any breach of it is instant and inevitable death?”

“最后一句话，麦克默多兄弟,”麦金蒂说。“你已经宣誓保守秘密和忠诚，你知道违背誓言的惩罚是立即和不可避免的死亡吗?”

“I am,” said McMurdo.

“是的,”麦克默多站表示。

“And you accept the rule of the Bodymaster for the time being under all circumstances?”

“你暂时在任何情况下都接受身体大师的规则吗?”

“I do.”

“我愿意。”

“Then in the name of Lodge 341, Vermissa, I welcome you to its privileges and debates. You will put the liquor on the table, Brother Scanlan, and we will drink to our worthy brother.”

”“那么，我以洛奇341，维尔米萨的名义，欢迎你参加它的特权和辩论。你把酒放在桌子上，斯坎兰兄弟，我们为我们可敬的兄弟干杯。”

McMurdo's coat had been brought to him; but before putting it on he examined his right arm, which still smarted heavily. There on the flesh of the forearm was a circle with a triangle within it, deep and red, as the branding iron had left it. One or two of his neighbours pulled up their sleeves and showed their own lodge marks.

麦克默多站的外套已经送到他面前，但在穿上之前，他检查了自己的右臂，右臂仍然疼得厉害。在前臂的肉上有一个圆圈，里面有一个三角形，深红色，因为烙铁已经离开了它。他的一两个邻居卷起袖子，露出了他们自己的小屋标记。

“We've all had it,” said one; “but not all as brave as you over it.”

“我们都经历过,”其中一个说，“但并不是所有人都像你一样勇敢。”

“Tut! It was nothing,” said he; but it burned and ached all the same.

“啧! 没什么,”他说，但它仍然在燃烧和疼痛。

When the drinks which followed the ceremony of initiation had all been disposed of, the business of the lodge proceeded. McMurdo, accustomed only to the prosaic performances of Chicago, listened with open ears and more surprise than he ventured to show to what followed.

入会仪式之后的饮料全部处理完毕之后，旅馆的事情就开始了。麦克默多站只习惯于芝加哥那种平淡无奇的表演，他听得津津有味，带着惊讶之情，而不是大胆地向人们展示接下来的表演。

“The first business on the agenda paper,” said McGinty, “is to read the following letter from Division Master Windle of Merton County Lodge 249. He says:

“议程上的第一件事,”麦金蒂说，“是阅读下面这封来自 Merton County Lodge 249师长温德尔的信。他表示:

“Dear Sir:

“亲爱的先生:

“There is a job to be done on Andrew Rae of Rae & Sturmash, coal owners near this place. You will remember that your lodge owes us a return, having had the service of two brethren in the matter of the patrolman last fall. You will send two good men, they will be taken charge of by Treasurer Higgins of this lodge, whose address you know. He will show them when to act and where. Yours in freedom,

“雷和斯特马什公司(Rae & Sturmash)的安德鲁•雷(Andrew Rae)有一项工作要做，他是这个地方附近的煤矿主。你们应该记得，你们的小屋在去年秋天因为巡警的事，雇用了两个兄弟，所以欠我们一个回报。你们要派两个好人来，他们将由这个分会的司库希金斯负责，你们知道他们的地址。他会告诉他们何时何地采取行动。你的自由,

“J. W. Windle D. M. A. O. F.

“ J.W.Windle D.M.O.f.”。

“Windle has never refused us when we have had occasion to ask for the loan of a man or two, and it is not for us to refuse him.” McGinty paused and looked round the room with his dull, malevolent eyes. “Who will volunteer for the job?”

“当我们需要借一两个人的时候，温德尔从来没有拒绝过我们，我们也不能拒绝他。”麦金蒂停了下来，用他那双迟钝而恶毒的眼睛环顾了一下房间。“谁愿意做这项工作?”

Several young fellows held up their hands. The Bodymaster looked at them with an approving smile.

几个小伙子举起了手，身体大师带着赞许的微笑看着他们。

“You'll do, Tiger Cormac. If you handle it as well as you did the last, you won't be wrong. And you, Wilson.”

“没问题，泰格 · 科马克。如果你能像上次那样处理好，你就不会错。还有你，威尔逊。”

“I've no pistol,” said the volunteer, a mere boy in his teens.

“我没有手枪,”志愿者说，他只是个十几岁的小男孩。

“It's your first, is it not? Well, you have to be blooded some time. It will be a great start for you. As to the pistol, you'll find it waiting for you, or I'm mistaken. If you report yourselves on Monday, it will be time enough. You'll get a great welcome when you return.”

“这是你的第一次，不是吗？总有一天你会热血沸腾的。这对你来说是一个很好的开始。至于手枪，你会发现它在等着你，或者我弄错了。如果你们星期一报到，时间就足够了。你回来的时候会受到热烈欢迎的。”

“Any reward this time?” asked Cormac, a thick-set, dark-faced, brutal-looking young man, whose ferocity had earned him the nickname of “Tiger.”

“这次有奖励吗?”科马克问道，他是一个身材魁梧、面色黝黑、长相凶残的年轻人，他的凶猛为他赢得了“老虎”的绰号

“Never mind the reward. You just do it for the honour of the thing. Maybe when it is done there will be a few odd dollars at the bottom of the box.”

“不用担心奖励。你这样做只是为了这件事的荣誉。也许当这一切结束时，盒子底部会有几块零钱。”

“What has the man done?” asked young Wilson.

“这个人做了什么?”年轻的威尔逊问。

“Sure, it's not for the likes of you to ask what the man has done. He has been judged over there. That's no business of ours. All we have to do is to carry it out for them, same as they would for us. Speaking of that, two brothers from the Merton lodge are coming over to us next week to do some business in this quarter.”

“当然，像你这样的人不应该问这个人做了什么。他在那里受到了审判。这不关我们的事。我们所要做的就是帮助他们，就像他们帮助我们一样。说到这个，默顿旅馆的兄弟俩下周要来我们这个季度做生意。”

“Who are they?” asked someone.

“他们是谁?”有人问。

“Faith, it is wiser not to ask. If you know nothing, you can testify nothing, and no trouble can come of it. But they are men who will make a clean job when they are about it.”

“信念，不问是更明智的。如果你什么都不知道，你就什么也不能作证，也不会有什么麻烦。但是他们是那些干净利落的人。”

“And time, too!” cried Ted Baldwin. “Folk are gettin' out of hand in these parts. It was only last week that three of our men were turned off by Foreman Blaker. It's been owing him a long time, and he'll get it full and proper.”

“还有时间!”特德 · 鲍德温喊道。“在这些地方，人们已经失控了。就在上个星期，我们的三个人被工头布莱克拒绝了。这已经欠他很长时间了，他会得到充分而适当的回报的。”

“Get what?” McMurdo whispered to his neighbour.

“得到什么?”麦克默多低声对他的邻居说。

“The business end of a buckshot cartridge!” cried the man with a loud laugh. “What think you of our ways, Brother?”

“大号铅弹的弹头!”那人大笑着说。“你觉得我们的方式怎么样，兄弟?”

McMurdo's criminal soul seemed to have already absorbed the spirit of the vile association of which he was now a member. “I like it well,” said he. “'Tis a proper place for a lad of mettle.”

麦克默多站的犯罪分子似乎已经吸收了他现在加入的这个邪恶组织的精神。“我很喜欢,”他说。“这是一个适合勇敢的小伙子的地方。”

Several of those who sat around heard his words and applauded them.

一些围坐在旁边的人听到他的话，为他鼓掌。

“What's that?” cried the black-maned Bodymaster from the end of the table.

“那是什么?”坐在桌子一头的黑发健身教练喊道。

“'Tis our new brother, sir, who finds our ways to his taste.”

“这是我们的新兄弟，先生，他找到了符合他口味的方法。”

McMurdo rose to his feet for an instant. “I would say, Eminent Bodymaster, that if a man should be wanted I should take it as an honour to be chosen to help the lodge.”

麦克默多站了一会儿。“我想说，杰出的健身大师，如果需要一个人，我会把被选中来帮助这个小组当作一种荣誉。”

There was great applause at this. It was felt that a new sun was pushing its rim above the horizon. To some of the elders it seemed that the progress was a little too rapid.

观众为此鼓掌。人们感到一个新的太阳正在把它的边缘推出地平线。对于一些老年人来说，这种进步似乎有点太快了。

“I would move,” said the secretary, Harraway, a vulture-faced old graybeard who sat near the chairman, “that Brother McMurdo should wait until it is the good pleasure of the lodge to employ him.”

“我会提议,”坐在主席身边的哈拉韦秘书说，“麦克默多兄弟应该等到旅馆很乐意雇用他的时候。”哈拉韦是一位秃鹰脸的老灰胡子

“Sure, that was what I meant; I'm in your hands,” said McMurdo.

“当然，我就是这个意思; 我在你的手中,”麦克默多站说。

“Your time will come, Brother,” said the chairman. “We have marked you down as a willing man, and we believe that you will do good work in these parts. There is a small matter to-night in which you may take a hand if it so please you.”

“你的时代会到来的，兄弟,”主席说。我们已经记录你是一个自愿的人，我们相信你会在这些地方做好工作。今天晚上有件小事，如果你愿意的话，可以帮我一把。”

“I will wait for something that is worth while.”

“我会等待一些值得的东西。”

“You can come to-night, anyhow, and it will help you to know what we stand for in this community. I will make the announcement later. Meanwhile,” he glanced at his agenda paper, “I have one or two more points to bring before the meeting. First of all, I will ask the treasurer as to our bank balance. There is the pension to Jim Carnaway's widow. He was struck down doing the work of the lodge, and it is for us to see that she is not the loser.”

“不管怎样，你今晚可以来，这将有助于你了解我们在这个社区里代表什么。我稍后会发表声明。与此同时,”他扫了一眼他的议程文件，“我还有一两点要在会议之前提出来。首先，我会向财务主管询问我们的银行存款余额。这是吉姆 · 卡纳韦的遗孀的抚恤金。他是因为做旅馆的工作而被击倒的，我们应该看到她不是失败者。”

“Jim was shot last month when they tried to kill Chester Wilcox of Marley Creek,” McMurdo's neighbour informed him.

“吉姆是在上个月他们试图杀死马利溪的切斯特 · 威尔科克斯时被枪杀的,”麦克默多的邻居告诉他。

“The funds are good at the moment,” said the treasurer, with the bankbook in front of him. “The firms have been generous of late. Max Linder & Co. paid five hundred to be left alone. Walker Brothers sent in a hundred; but I took it on myself to return it and ask for five. If I do not hear by Wednesday, their winding gear may get out of order. We had to burn their breaker last year before they became reasonable. Then the West Section Coaling Company has paid its annual contribution. We have enough on hand to meet any obligations.”

“目前资金状况良好,”财务主管说，手里拿着银行存折。“这些公司最近表现得很慷慨。马克斯 · 林德公司付了500美元让他独处。沃克兄弟送来了一百个，但是我自己承担了退货的责任，要了五个。如果到星期三我还没有听到消息，他们的缠绕装置可能会出故障。去年我们不得不烧了他们的破船，他们才变得通情达理。随后，西段煤炭公司缴纳了年度会费。我们手头有足够的资金来履行任何义务。”

“What about Archie Swindon?” asked a brother.

“阿尔奇 · 斯文顿怎么样?”一个兄弟问。

“He has sold out and left the district. The old devil left a note for us to say that he had rather be a free crossing sweeper in New York than a large mine owner under the power of a ring of blackmailers. By Gar! it was as well that he made a break for it before the note reached us! I guess he won't show his face in this valley again.”

“他出卖了自己，离开了这个地区。这个老魔鬼给我们留了一张纸条，说他宁愿在纽约当一个自由的过马路的清洁工，也不愿意在一群勒索者的势力下当一个大矿主。作者: Gar！还好他在纸条到达我们手里之前逃走了！我想他再也不会在这个山谷露面了。”

An elderly, clean-shaved man with a kindly face and a good brow rose from the end of the table which faced the chairman. “Mr. Treasurer,” he asked, “may I ask who has bought the property of this man that we have driven out of the district?”

面对主席的那张桌子的一端站了起来，一个年长的，脸上光溜溜的，长相和蔼，眉毛很好看的男人。“司库先生,”他问道，“我可以问一下是谁买了这个我们已经赶出这个地区的人的财产吗?”

“Yes, Brother Morris. It has been bought by the State & Merton County Railroad Company.”

“是的，莫里斯兄弟。它已被国家和默顿县铁路公司买下。”

“And who bought the mines of Todman and of Lee that came into the market in the same way last year?”

“谁买下了去年以同样方式进入市场的托德曼和李的矿井?”

“The same company, Brother Morris.”

“同一家公司，莫里斯兄弟。”

“And who bought the ironworks of Manson and of Shuman and of Van Deher and of Atwood, which have all been given up of late?”

谁买了曼森、舒曼、范德赫和阿特伍德的铁厂，这些铁厂最近都被卖掉了

“They were all bought by the West Gilmerton General Mining Company.”

“它们都被西吉尔默顿矿业总公司(West Gilmerton General Mining Company)收购。”

“I don't see, Brother Morris,” said the chairman, “that it matters to us who buys them, since they can't carry them out of the district.”

“我不明白，莫里斯兄弟,”主席说，“谁买它们对我们来说很重要，因为它们不能把它们运出这个地区。”

“With all respect to you, Eminent Bodymaster, I think it may matter very much to us. This process has been going on now for ten long years. We are gradually driving all the small men out of trade. What is the result? We find in their places great companies like the Railroad or the General Iron, who have their directors in New York or Philadelphia, and care nothing for our threats. We can take it out of their local bosses, but it only means that others will be sent in their stead. And we are making it dangerous for ourselves. The small men could not harm us. They had not the money nor the power. So long as we did not squeeze them too dry, they would stay on under our power. But if these big companies find that we stand between them and their profits, they will spare no pains and no expense to hunt us down and bring us to court.”

“尊敬的先生，我认为这对我们非常重要。这个过程已经持续了整整十年。我们正在逐渐使所有的小人物失业。结果是什么？我们发现在他们的地方伟大的公司，像铁路公司或铁将军，他们有他们的董事在纽约或费城，并不关心我们的威胁。我们可以从他们当地的老板那里得到这个权利，但这只意味着其他人会代替他们。我们正在使它对我们自己造成危险。这些小人物伤害不了我们。他们既没有钱也没有权力。只要我们不把它们榨得太干，它们就会在我们的力量下继续存在下去。但是，如果这些大公司发现我们挡在他们和他们的利润之间，他们会不遗余力、不惜一切代价追捕我们，把我们告上法庭。”

There was a hush at these ominous words, and every face darkened as gloomy looks were exchanged. So omnipotent and unchallenged had they been that the very thought that there was possible retribution in the background had been banished from their minds. And yet the idea struck a chill to the most reckless of them.

这些不祥的话语中有一种寂静，每个人的脸都变得阴沉起来，交换着忧郁的表情。他们是如此的无所不能，无所不能，以至于他们脑子里已经没有了可能会有报应的想法。然而，这个想法让他们中最不计后果的人感到一阵寒意。

“It is my advice,” the speaker continued, “that we go easier upon the small men. On the day that they have all been driven out the power of this society will have been broken.”

“我的建议是,”演讲者继续说道，“我们应该对小人物宽容一些。当他们全部被赶走的那一天，这个社会的力量就会被打破。”

Unwelcome truths are not popular. There were angry cries as the speaker resumed his seat. McGinty rose with gloom upon his brow.

不受欢迎的事实并不受欢迎。演讲者回到座位上时发出愤怒的叫喊声。麦金蒂眉宇间阴郁地站了起来。

“Brother Morris,” said he, “you were always a croaker. So long as the members of this lodge stand together there is no power in the United States that can touch them. Sure, have we not tried it often enough in the law courts? I expect the big companies will find it easier to pay than to fight, same as the little companies do. And now, Brethren,” McGinty took off his black velvet cap and his stole as he spoke, “this lodge has finished its business for the evening, save for one small matter which may be mentioned when we are parting. The time has now come for fraternal refreshment and for harmony.”

“莫里斯兄弟,”他说，“你总是个黄鱼。只要这个小组的成员们站在一起，在美国就没有任何力量可以触及他们。当然，难道我们在法庭上还没有足够频繁地尝试过吗？我希望大公司能像小公司一样，发现支付比战斗更容易。“现在，弟兄们,”麦金蒂一面说，一面脱下他的黑天鹅绒帽子和披肩，“这个小屋今晚的活动已经结束了，只有一件小事可以在我们分别时提到。现在是兄弟一心，和睦相处的时候了。”

Strange indeed is human nature. Here were these men, to whom murder was familiar, who again and again had struck down the father of the family, some man against whom they had no personal feeling, without one thought of compunction or of compassion for his weeping wife or helpless children, and yet the tender or pathetic in music could move them to tears. McMurdo had a fine tenor voice, and if he had failed to gain the good will of the lodge before, it could no longer have been withheld after he had thrilled them with “I'm Sitting on the Stile, Mary,” and “On the Banks of Allan Water.”

人的本性真是奇怪。这些人，他们熟悉谋杀，一次又一次地杀害了家里的父亲，这些人对他们没有个人感情，对他哭泣的妻子或无助的孩子没有丝毫的内疚或怜悯，然而音乐中的温柔或悲哀却能使他们落泪。麦克默多有着优美的男高音嗓音，如果他之前没有赢得旅馆的好感，那么在他用“我坐在 Stile 上，玛丽”和“在艾伦河岸上”激励他们之后，这种好感就不可能再被抑制了

In his very first night the new recruit had made himself one of the most popular of the brethren, marked already for advancement and high office. There were other qualities needed, however, besides those of good fellowship, to make a worthy Freeman, and of these he was given an example before the evening was over. The whisky bottle had passed round many times, and the men were flushed and ripe for mischief when their Bodymaster rose once more to address them.

在第一天晚上，这个新成员就使自己成为同胞中最受欢迎的一个，已经有了晋升和高级职位的标志。然而，要成为一个有价值的弗里曼，除了要有良好的友谊，还需要其他的品质。威士忌酒瓶已经转了好几圈了，当他们的贴身主人再次站起来对他们说话时，他们的脸都红了，准备调皮捣蛋了。

“Boys,” said he, “there's one man in this town that wants trimming up, and it's for you to see that he gets it. I'm speaking of James Stanger of the Herald. You've seen how he's been opening his mouth against us again?”

“孩子们,”他说，“这个镇上有一个人要修剪，你们应该看看他是否做到了。我说的是《先驱报》的詹姆斯 · 斯坦格。你看到他又开始跟我们对着干了吗?”

There was a murmur of assent, with many a muttered oath. McGinty took a slip of paper from his waistcoat pocket.

人们低声表示同意，许多人低声咒骂。麦金蒂从背心口袋里掏出一张纸条。

Law and Order!

法律与秩序！

That's how he heads it.

他就是这么领导的。

“Reign of terror in the coal and iron district

“煤铁区的恐怖统治

“Twelve years have now elapsed since the first assassinations which proved the existence of a criminal organization in our midst. From that day these outrages have never ceased, until now they have reached a pitch which makes us the opprobrium of the civilized world. Is it for such results as this that our great country welcomes to its bosom the alien who flies from the despotisms of Europe? Is it that they shall themselves become tyrants over the very men who have given them shelter, and that a state of terrorism and lawlessness should be established under the very shadow of the sacred folds of the starry Flag of Freedom which would raise horror in our minds if we read of it as existing under the most effete monarchy of the East? The men are known. The organization is patent and public. How long are we to endure it? Can we forever live—

“自从第一次暗杀事件证明我们中间存在一个犯罪组织以来，已经过去了12年。从那天起，这些暴行就没有停止过，直到现在，它们达到了一种程度，使我们成为文明世界的耻辱。难道我们伟大的国家就是为了这样的结果而欢迎从欧洲的专制统治下逃走的外国人？难道他们自己会成为那些庇护他们的人的暴君，恐怖主义和无法无天的状态应该建立在星光灿烂的自由旗帜的神圣褶皱的阴影之下，如果我们把它看作是存在于东方最衰弱的君主制之下，这会在我们心中引起恐惧吗？这些男人是众所周知的。这个组织是专利和公共的。我们还要忍受多久？我们能永远活下去吗

Sure, I've read enough of the slush!“ cried the chairman, tossing the paper down upon the table. ”That's what he says of us. The question I'm asking you is what shall we say to him?“

当然，我已经读了足够多的废话！”主席叫道，把报纸扔在桌子上”他就是这么说我们的。我问你的问题是我们该对他说什么？“

“Kill him!” cried a dozen fierce voices.

“杀了他!”十几个凶狠的声音喊道。

“I protest against that,” said Brother Morris, the man of the good brow and shaved face. “I tell you, Brethren, that our hand is too heavy in this valley, and that there will come a point where in self-defense every man will unite to crush us out. James Stanger is an old man. He is respected in the township and the district. His paper stands for all that is solid in the valley. If that man is struck down, there will be a stir through this state that will only end with our destruction.”

“我对此表示抗议,”莫里斯兄弟说，他眉毛很好，脸刮得很干净。“弟兄们，我告诉你们，在这个山谷里，我们的手太重了，总有一天，为了自卫，每个人都会联合起来，把我们赶尽杀绝。詹姆斯 · 斯坦格是个老人。他在镇上和区里都很受人尊敬。他的论文代表了山谷中所有坚实的东西。如果那个人被击倒，这个国家就会掀起一场骚动，结果只会是我们的毁灭。”

“And how would they bring about our destruction, Mr. Standback?” cried McGinty. “Is it by the police? Sure, half of them are in our pay and half of them afraid of us. Or is it by the law courts and the judge? Haven't we tried that before now, and what ever came of it?”

“他们怎么会毁了我们呢，斯丹巴克先生?”麦金蒂喊道。”“是警察吗？当然，他们一半是我们的人，一半是怕我们的人。还是由法庭和法官决定？我们以前没有试过吗? 结果呢?”

“There is a Judge Lynch that might try the case,” said Brother Morris.

“有一个法官林奇可能会审理这个案件,”莫里斯说。

A general shout of anger greeted the suggestion.

这个建议引起了一片愤怒的叫喊声。

“I have but to raise my finger,” cried McGinty, “and I could put two hundred men into this town that would clear it out from end to end.” Then suddenly raising his voice and bending his huge black brows into a terrible frown, “See here, Brother Morris, I have my eye on you, and have had for some time! You've no heart yourself, and you try to take the heart out of others. It will be an ill day for you, Brother Morris, when your own name comes on our agenda paper, and I'm thinking that it's just there that I ought to place it.”

“我只要举起我的手指,”麦金蒂大声说，“我就可以派两百人进入这个镇子，把它从头到尾清理干净。”突然，他提高了嗓门，皱起了他那巨大的黑眉头，皱起了可怕的眉头: “看这儿，莫里斯兄弟，我盯着你看，已经有一段时间了！你自己没有心，你试图把别人的心挖出来。莫里斯兄弟，如果你的名字出现在我们的议事日程上，那将是你倒霉的一天，我想我应该把它放在那里。”

Morris had turned deadly pale, and his knees seemed to give way under him as he fell back into his chair. He raised his glass in his trembling hand and drank before he could answer. “I apologize, Eminent Bodymaster, to you and to every brother in this lodge if I have said more than I should. I am a faithful member—you all know that—and it is my fear lest evil come to the lodge which makes me speak in anxious words. But I have greater trust in your judgment than in my own, Eminent Bodymaster, and I promise you that I will not offend again.”

莫里斯的脸色苍白得要命，当他倒在椅子上时，膝盖似乎塌了下来。他用颤抖的手举起酒杯，还没来得及回答就喝了起来。“尊敬的健身大师，如果我说得太多，我向你和这个小屋里的每一位兄弟道歉。我是一个忠实的会员ーー你们都知道ーー我害怕邪恶来到会所，这使我说起话来焦虑不安。但是我更相信你的判断力，而不是我自己的判断力，我向你保证，我不会再犯了。”

The Bodymaster's scowl relaxed as he listened to the humble words. “Very good, Brother Morris. It's myself that would be sorry if it were needful to give you a lesson. But so long as I am in this chair we shall be a united lodge in word and in deed. And now, boys,” he continued, looking round at the company, “I'll say this much, that if Stanger got his full deserts there would be more trouble than we need ask for. These editors hang together, and every journal in the state would be crying out for police and troops. But I guess you can give him a pretty severe warning. Will you fix it, Brother Baldwin?”

听到这些谦卑的话语，身体大师的怒容消失了。“很好，莫里斯兄弟。如果有必要给你上一课的话，我自己才会感到抱歉。但是只要我还在这个位子上，我们就会在言行上团结一致。“现在，孩子们,”他环顾四周，继续说道，“我要说的是，如果斯坦格得到应有的惩罚，麻烦就会比我们所需要的更多。这些编辑团结在一起，这个州的每一份杂志都会呼吁警察和军队的到来。但我想你可以给他一个相当严厉的警告。你能修好它吗，鲍德温修士?”

“Sure!” said the young man eagerly.

“当然!”年轻人急切地说。

“How many will you take?”

“你要吃多少?”

“Half a dozen, and two to guard the door. You'll come, Gower, and you, Mansel, and you, Scanlan, and the two Willabys.”

”“六个，两个看门。你会来的，高尔，你，曼塞尔，你，斯坎兰，还有两个威拉比。”

“I promised the new brother he should go,” said the chairman.

主席说: “我答应了新来的兄弟，他应该去。”。

Ted Baldwin looked at McMurdo with eyes which showed that he had not forgotten nor forgiven. “Well, he can come if he wants,” he said in a surly voice. “That's enough. The sooner we get to work the better.”

特德•鲍德温(Ted Baldwin)看着麦克默多站的眼神表明，他既没有忘记，也没有原谅。“好吧，如果他愿意，他可以来,”他用粗暴的声音说。“够了。我们越早开始工作越好。”

The company broke up with shouts and yells and snatches of drunken song. The bar was still crowded with revellers, and many of the brethren remained there. The little band who had been told off for duty passed out into the street, proceeding in twos and threes along the sidewalk so as not to provoke attention. It was a bitterly cold night, with a half-moon shining brilliantly in a frosty, star-spangled sky. The men stopped and gathered in a yard which faced a high building. The words “Vermissa Herald” were printed in gold lettering between the brightly lit windows. From within came the clanking of the printing press.

这个连队在一片叫喊声和断断续续的醉歌声中解散了。酒吧里仍然挤满了寻欢作乐的人，许多弟兄们还留在那里。那个被叫去值班的小乐队三三两两地沿着人行道走到街上，以免引起别人的注意。那是一个寒冷刺骨的夜晚，半月在结霜的星光灿烂的天空中闪耀着光芒。男人们停下来，聚集在一个院子里，院子对着一座高楼。在明亮的窗户之间，用金色的字体印着“先驱者 Vermissa”。从里面传来了印刷机的叮当声。

“Here, you,” said Baldwin to McMurdo, “you can stand below at the door and see that the road is kept open for us. Arthur Willaby can stay with you. You others come with me. Have no fears, boys; for we have a dozen witnesses that we are in the Union Bar at this very moment.”

“喂，你,”鲍德温对麦克默多站说，“你可以站在下面的门口，看看路是不是为我们敞开的。亚瑟 · 威拉比可以和你一起住。你们其他人跟我来。孩子们，不要害怕，因为我们有十几个证人可以证明此时此刻我们正在联合律师协会里。”

It was nearly midnight, and the street was deserted save for one or two revellers upon their way home. The party crossed the road, and, pushing open the door of the newspaper office, Baldwin and his men rushed in and up the stair which faced them. McMurdo and another remained below. From the room above came a shout, a cry for help, and then the sound of trampling feet and of falling chairs. An instant later a gray-haired man rushed out on the landing.

已经快到午夜了，街上空无一人，只有一两个人在回家的路上狂欢。一行人穿过马路，推开报社的门，鲍德温和他的手下冲了进来，爬上了面对他们的楼梯。麦克默多站和另一个仍在下面。从楼上的房间传来一声呼喊，一声求救，然后是脚步踩踏和椅子倒下的声音。过了一会儿，楼梯平台上跑出来一个头发花白的人。

He was seized before he could get farther, and his spectacles came tinkling down to McMurdo's feet. There was a thud and a groan. He was on his face, and half a dozen sticks were clattering together as they fell upon him. He writhed, and his long, thin limbs quivered under the blows. The others ceased at last; but Baldwin, his cruel face set in an infernal smile, was hacking at the man's head, which he vainly endeavoured to defend with his arms. His white hair was dabbled with patches of blood. Baldwin was still stooping over his victim, putting in a short, vicious blow whenever he could see a part exposed, when McMurdo dashed up the stair and pushed him back.

他还没走多远就被抓住了，他的眼镜叮叮当当地落到了麦克默多站的脚下。砰的一声，一声呻吟。他倒在地上，六根棍子砸在他身上发出咔哒咔哒的声音。他扭动着身体，瘦长的四肢在打击下颤抖着。其他人最后都停了下来，但是鲍德温那张残忍的脸上露出恶毒的微笑，他正在砍那个人的头，他徒劳地用手臂试图保护他的头。他的白发上沾满了血迹。当麦克默多站冲上楼梯把他推回去的时候，Baldwin 仍然俯身在他的受害者身上，只要看到一个部分露出来，他就猛击受害者一下。

“You'll kill the man,” said he. “Drop it!”

“你会杀了那个人的,”他说，“放下枪!”

Baldwin looked at him in amazement. “Curse you!” he cried. “Who are you to interfere—you that are new to the lodge? Stand back!” He raised his stick; but McMurdo had whipped his pistol out of his hip pocket.

鲍德温惊讶地看着他。“诅咒你!”他哭了起来。”“你是谁? 你是新来的吗？退后!”他举起手杖，但是麦克默多已经从他的屁股口袋里掏出了手枪。

“Stand back yourself!” he cried. “I'll blow your face in if you lay a hand on me. As to the lodge, wasn't it the order of the Bodymaster that the man was not to be killed—and what are you doing but killing him?”

“你自己往后站!”他哭了起来。“如果你敢碰我，我就打爆你的脸。至于那个小屋，那个人不应该被杀死，这不是肉身大师的命令吗? 除了杀死他，你还在干什么?”

“It's truth he says,” remarked one of the men.

“他说的是实话,”其中一个人说。

“By Gar! you'd best hurry yourselves!” cried the man below. “The windows are all lighting up, and you'll have the whole town here inside of five minutes.”

“以加尔之名！你们最好快点!”楼下的人喊道。“所有的窗户都亮起来了，五分钟之内你就可以看到整个城市。”

There was indeed the sound of shouting in the street, and a little group of compositors and pressmen was forming in the hall below and nerving itself to action. Leaving the limp and motionless body of the editor at the head of the stair, the criminals rushed down and made their way swiftly along the street. Having reached the Union House, some of them mixed with the crowd in McGinty's saloon, whispering across the bar to the Boss that the job had been well carried through. Others, and among them McMurdo, broke away into side streets, and so by devious paths to their own homes.

街上的确有叫喊声，楼下的大厅里正聚集着一小群排字工人和印刷工人，他们正鼓起勇气采取行动。罪犯们把编辑那软弱无力、一动不动的身子留在楼梯口，冲下楼来，沿着街道迅速地走着。到了联合大厦后，有些人混在麦金蒂酒吧里的人群中，在吧台对老板耳语，说这项工作完成得很好。其他人，其中包括麦克默多，则从小路逃到他们自己的家里。
