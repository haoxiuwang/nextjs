  title: "Chapter I. The Scowrers 死酷党人",
  book: "The Valley Of Fear"
}

It was the fourth of February in the year 1875. It had been a severe winter, and the snow lay deep in the gorges of the Gilmerton Mountains. The steam ploughs had, however, kept the railroad open, and the evening train which connects the long line of coal-mining and iron-working settlements was slowly groaning its way up the steep gradients which lead from Stagville on the plain to Vermissa, the central township which lies at the head of Vermissa Valley. From this point the track sweeps downward to Bartons Crossing, Helmdale, and the purely agricultural county of Merton. It was a single-track railroad; but at every siding—and they were numerous—long lines of trucks piled with coal and iron ore told of the hidden wealth which had brought a rude population and a bustling life to this most desolate corner of the United States of America.

那是一八七五年的二月四日。那是一个寒冷的冬天，吉尔默顿山脉的峡谷里积着厚厚的雪。然而，蒸汽犁使铁路保持畅通，连接煤矿和铁矿开采定居点的长线夜间列车缓慢地呻吟着沿着陡峭的梯度向上行驶，这条陡峭的梯度从平原上的 Stagville 通往坐落在 Vermissa 山谷顶端的中心城镇 Vermissa。从这里开始，铁轨向下蔓延到 Bartons Crossing、 Helmdale 和纯农业的默顿。这是一条单轨铁路，但每一条铁路线上都有许多长长的卡车队伍，车上装满了煤炭和铁矿石。这些卡车告诉我们，在美利坚合众国这个最荒凉的角落，隐藏的财富给这里带来了粗鲁的人口和繁忙的生活。

For desolate it was! Little could the first pioneer who had traversed it have ever imagined that the fairest prairies and the most lush water pastures were valueless compared to this gloomy land of black crag and tangled forest. Above the dark and often scarcely penetrable woods upon their flanks, the high, bare crowns of the mountains, white snow, and jagged rock towered upon each flank, leaving a long, winding, tortuous valley in the centre. Up this the little train was slowly crawling.

因为它是荒凉的！第一个走过这片土地的拓荒者怎么也想不到，这片美丽的草原和最茂盛的牧场，与这片黑暗的峭壁和杂乱的森林相比，竟是一文不值的。在他们两侧的山腰上，是一片黑暗难以穿透的森林，高高的山峦顶端，雪白的雪，两侧耸立着参差不齐的岩石，中间是一条蜿蜒曲折的山谷。沿着这条路，小火车慢慢地爬行着。

The oil lamps had just been lit in the leading passenger car, a long, bare carriage in which some twenty or thirty people were seated. The greater number of these were workmen returning from their day's toil in the lower part of the valley. At least a dozen, by their grimed faces and the safety lanterns which they carried, proclaimed themselves miners. These sat smoking in a group and conversed in low voices, glancing occasionally at two men on the opposite side of the car, whose uniforms and badges showed them to be policemen.

领头的客车里油灯刚刚点亮，那是一节长长的光秃秃的车厢，大约有二三十个人坐在里面。其中大部分是从山谷下部劳作一天后返回的工人。至少有十几个人，从他们满脸污垢的面孔和随身携带的安全灯来看，他们宣称自己是矿工。这些人坐在一起抽烟，低声交谈，偶尔看看车对面的两个人，他们的制服和警徽显示他们是警察。

Several women of the labouring class and one or two travellers who might have been small local storekeepers made up the rest of the company, with the exception of one young man in a corner by himself. It is with this man that we are concerned. Take a good look at him, for he is worth it.

几个劳动阶层的妇女和一两个可能是当地小店主的旅客组成了公司的其他人员，只有一个年轻人独自坐在一个角落里。我们关心的是这个人。好好看看他，他值得你这样做。

He is a fresh-complexioned, middle-sized young man, not far, one would guess, from his thirtieth year. He has large, shrewd, humorous gray eyes which twinkle inquiringly from time to time as he looks round through his spectacles at the people about him. It is easy to see that he is of a sociable and possibly simple disposition, anxious to be friendly to all men. Anyone could pick him at once as gregarious in his habits and communicative in his nature, with a quick wit and a ready smile. And yet the man who studied him more closely might discern a certain firmness of jaw and grim tightness about the lips which would warn him that there were depths beyond, and that this pleasant, brown-haired young Irishman might conceivably leave his mark for good or evil upon any society to which he was introduced.

他是一个身材中等的年轻人，看起来不远，大概三十多岁了。他有一双又大又精明又幽默的灰色眼睛，当他透过眼镜环顾四周看着周围的人时，眼睛不时发出询问的光芒。显而易见，他性情好交际，也许还很单纯，渴望对所有的人都友好。任何人都可以一眼看出他是个爱交际的人，天性健谈，机智敏捷，面带微笑。然而，那个仔细观察他的人可能会看出他下巴的坚硬和嘴唇的严厉紧闭，这些都会警告他，在深渊之外还有更深的东西，这个愉快的棕色头发的年轻爱尔兰人可能会在他所接触的任何社会中留下善恶的印记。

Having made one or two tentative remarks to the nearest miner, and receiving only short, gruff replies, the traveller resigned himself to uncongenial silence, staring moodily out of the window at the fading landscape.

旅行者对最近的矿工说了一两句试探性的话，得到的只是简短粗暴的回答，他听任自己陷入不适宜的沉默，郁郁不乐地望着窗外渐渐消失的风景。

It was not a cheering prospect. Through the growing gloom there pulsed the red glow of the furnaces on the sides of the hills. Great heaps of slag and dumps of cinders loomed up on each side, with the high shafts of the collieries towering above them. Huddled groups of mean, wooden houses, the windows of which were beginning to outline themselves in light, were scattered here and there along the line, and the frequent halting places were crowded with their swarthy inhabitants.

这不是一个令人振奋的前景。在越来越浓的黑暗中，山坡两侧的火炉发出红色的光辉。煤渣堆积如山，高耸的煤矿高耸在两边。沿着铁路线，挤成一团的简陋的木头房子到处都是，窗户开始在光线中勾勒出轮廓，时不时停下来的地方挤满了黝黑的居民。

The iron and coal valleys of the Vermissa district were no resorts for the leisured or the cultured. Everywhere there were stern signs of the crudest battle of life, the rude work to be done, and the rude, strong workers who did it.

Vermissa 地区的铁矿和煤矿山谷不是休闲人士或文化人士的度假胜地。到处都是生活中最残酷的战斗的严峻标志，有粗糙的工作要做，还有粗鲁、强壮的工人在做。

The young traveller gazed out into this dismal country with a face of mingled repulsion and interest, which showed that the scene was new to him. At intervals he drew from his pocket a bulky letter to which he referred, and on the margins of which he scribbled some notes. Once from the back of his waist he produced something which one would hardly have expected to find in the possession of so mild-mannered a man. It was a navy revolver of the largest size. As he turned it slantwise to the light, the glint upon the rims of the copper shells within the drum showed that it was fully loaded. He quickly restored it to his secret pocket, but not before it had been observed by a working man who had seated himself upon the adjoining bench.

这位年轻的旅行者望着这个凄凉的地方，脸上带着既厌恶又感兴趣的表情，这表明这种景象对他来说是新鲜的。他不时从口袋里掏出一封厚重的信，在信的空白处潦草地写了几行字。有一次，他从腰部后面拿出一样东西，人们很难想象在这样温文尔雅的人身上会发现这样的东西。这是一把最大尺寸的海军左轮手枪。当他把它倾斜地对着灯光的时候，鼓内铜壳边上的闪光表明它已经装满了。他很快地把它放回他的秘密口袋里，但在此之前，一个坐在隔壁长凳上的工人看到了它。

“Hullo, mate!” said he. “You seem heeled and ready.”

“喂，伙计!”他说，“你看起来很有准备。”

The young man smiled with an air of embarrassment.

那个年轻人窘迫地笑了笑。

“Yes,” said he, “we need them sometimes in the place I come from.”

“是的,”他说，“在我的家乡，有时候我们需要它们。”

“And where may that be?”

“那会在哪儿呢?”

“I'm last from Chicago.”

“我是最后一个从芝加哥来的。”

“A stranger in these parts?”

“这里有陌生人吗?”

“Yes.”

“是的。”

“You may find you need it here,” said the workman.

“你可能会发现你需要它在这里,”工人说。

“Ah! is that so?” The young man seemed interested.

“啊! 是这样吗?”年轻人似乎很感兴趣。

“Have you heard nothing of doings hereabouts?”

“你没听说这附近有什么动静吗?”

“Nothing out of the way.”

“没什么特别的。”

“Why, I thought the country was full of it. You'll hear quick enough. What made you come here?”

“为什么，我以为这个国家到处都是。你很快就会听到的。你为什么来这里?”

“I heard there was always work for a willing man.”

“我听说总是有工作给心甘情愿的人。”

“Are you a member of the union?”

“你是工会的成员吗?”

“Sure.”

“当然。”

“Then you'll get your job, I guess. Have you any friends?”

“那么我想你会得到你的工作的。你有朋友吗?”

“Not yet; but I have the means of making them.”

“还没有，不过我有办法做出来。”

“How's that, then?”

“怎么样?”

“I am one of the Eminent Order of Freemen. There's no town without a lodge, and where there is a lodge I'll find my friends.”

“我是杰出的自由人之一。没有一个城镇没有旅馆，只要有旅馆，我就能找到我的朋友。”

The remark had a singular effect upon his companion. He glanced round suspiciously at the others in the car. The miners were still whispering among themselves. The two police officers were dozing. He came across, seated himself close to the young traveller, and held out his hand.

这句话对他的同伴产生了奇怪的影响。他怀疑地环顾了一下车里的其他人。矿工们仍在窃窃私语。那两个警察正在打瞌睡。他走过去，挨着那位年轻的旅行者坐下，伸出手来。

“Put it there,” he said.

“把它放在那儿,”他说。

A hand-grip passed between the two.

两人握了握手。

“I see you speak the truth,” said the workman. “But it's well to make certain.” He raised his right hand to his right eyebrow. The traveller at once raised his left hand to his left eyebrow.

“我看你说的是实话,”工人说。“但最好确定一下。”他把右手举到右眉上。旅行者立刻把左手举到左眉毛处。

“Dark nights are unpleasant,” said the workman.

“黑夜是不愉快的,”工人说。

“Yes, for strangers to travel,” the other answered.

“是的，让陌生人旅行,”另一个回答。

“That's good enough. I'm Brother Scanlan, Lodge 341, Vermissa Valley. Glad to see you in these parts.”

“很好，我是斯坎兰修士，住在维尔米萨山谷的洛奇341号。很高兴在这里见到你。”

“Thank you. I'm Brother John McMurdo, Lodge 29, Chicago. Bodymaster J. H. Scott. But I am in luck to meet a brother so early.”

“谢谢。我是兄弟约翰麦克默多，洛奇29，芝加哥。身体大师 j · h · 斯科特。但我很幸运，这么早就遇到了一个兄弟。”

“Well, there are plenty of us about. You won't find the order more flourishing anywhere in the States than right here in Vermissa Valley. But we could do with some lads like you. I can't understand a spry man of the union finding no work to do in Chicago.”

“好吧，我们这儿有很多人。你不会发现在美国的任何地方比在 Vermissa 山谷更繁荣的秩序。但我们需要你这样的小伙子。我不能理解一个精力充沛的工会成员在芝加哥找不到工作。”

“I found plenty of work to do,” said McMurdo.

“我找到了很多工作要做,”麦克默多站表示。

“Then why did you leave?”

“那你为什么要离开?”

McMurdo nodded towards the policemen and smiled. “I guess those chaps would be glad to know,” he said.

麦克默多站向警察点点头，笑了笑，“我想那些家伙知道了会很高兴的,”他说。

Scanlan groaned sympathetically. “In trouble?” he asked in a whisper.

斯坎兰同情地呻吟着。“有麻烦了?”他低声问道。

“Deep.”

“很深。”

“A penitentiary job?”

“监狱工作?”

“And the rest.”

“还有其他的。”

“Not a killing!”

“不是杀人!”

“It's early days to talk of such things,” said McMurdo with the air of a man who had been surprised into saying more than he intended. “I've my own good reasons for leaving Chicago, and let that be enough for you. Who are you that you should take it on yourself to ask such things?” His gray eyes gleamed with sudden and dangerous anger from behind his glasses.

“现在谈论这些事情还为时过早,”麦克默多站说，他的神情就像一个惊讶地说出了自己不想说的话的人。“我有我自己离开芝加哥的充分理由，这对你来说就足够了。你以为你是谁，竟敢自作主张问这种问题?”他灰色的眼睛里闪烁着突然而危险的愤怒，这愤怒来自他的眼镜后面。

“All right, mate, no offense meant. The boys will think none the worse of you, whatever you may have done. Where are you bound for now?”

“好吧，伙计，无意冒犯。不管你做了什么，孩子们都不会把你想得更坏。你现在要去哪里?”

“Vermissa.”

“ Vermissa。”

“That's the third halt down the line. Where are you staying?”

“这是第三个站点，你住在哪里?”

McMurdo took out an envelope and held it close to the murky oil lamp. “Here is the address—Jacob Shafter, Sheridan Street. It's a boarding house that was recommended by a man I knew in Chicago.”

麦克默多拿出一个信封，把它放在昏暗的油灯旁边。“这是地址ー Sheridan Street 的雅各布•沙福特。这是我在芝加哥认识的一个人推荐的寄宿公寓。”

“Well, I don't know it; but Vermissa is out of my beat. I live at Hobson's Patch, and that's here where we are drawing up. But, say, there's one bit of advice I'll give you before we part: If you're in trouble in Vermissa, go straight to the Union House and see Boss McGinty. He is the Bodymaster of Vermissa Lodge, and nothing can happen in these parts unless Black Jack McGinty wants it. So long, mate! Maybe we'll meet in lodge one of these evenings. But mind my words: If you are in trouble, go to Boss McGinty.”

”“嗯，我不知道，但是维尔米萨不在我的管辖范围内。我住在霍布森小区，我们就是在这里起草的。但是，在我们分手之前，我会给你一个小小的建议: 如果你在 Vermissa 遇到麻烦，直接去联合大厦见麦金蒂老板。他是 Vermissa Lodge 的贴身主人，除非黑人杰克 · 麦金蒂想要，否则这里不会发生任何事情。再见，伙计！也许我们可以找个晚上在小屋见面。但是记住我的话: 如果你有麻烦，去找麦金蒂老板。”

Scanlan descended, and McMurdo was left once again to his thoughts. Night had now fallen, and the flames of the frequent furnaces were roaring and leaping in the darkness. Against their lurid background dark figures were bending and straining, twisting and turning, with the motion of winch or of windlass, to the rhythm of an eternal clank and roar.

斯坎兰下来了，麦克默多又一次被留在他的思想里。夜幕已经降临，火炉的火焰在黑暗中轰鸣跳跃。在他们骇人的背景下，黑色的身影在随着绞盘或绞盘的旋转，随着永恒的隆隆声和咆哮声的节奏，弯曲着、扭曲着、旋转着。

“I guess hell must look something like that,” said a voice.

“我想地狱一定是这样的,”一个声音说。

McMurdo turned and saw that one of the policemen had shifted in his seat and was staring out into the fiery waste.

麦克默多站转过身来，看到一个警察在座位上挪动了一下，盯着外面炽热的废墟。

“For that matter,” said the other policeman, “I allow that hell must be something like that. If there are worse devils down yonder than some we could name, it's more than I'd expect. I guess you are new to this part, young man?”

“就这一点来说,”另一个警察说，“我承认那个地狱一定是那样的。如果那里有比我们所能说出的更糟糕的恶魔，那就比我想象的要多。年轻人，我想你对这个角色还是新手吧?”

“Well, what if I am?” McMurdo answered in a surly voice.

“好吧，如果我是呢?”麦克默多站用粗暴的声音回答。

“Just this, mister, that I should advise you to be careful in choosing your friends. I don't think I'd begin with Mike Scanlan or his gang if I were you.”

“先生，我只是建议你在选择朋友时要谨慎一点。如果我是你，我不认为我会从迈克 · 斯坎兰或他的帮派开始。”

“What the hell is it to you who are my friends?” roared McMurdo in a voice which brought every head in the carriage round to witness the altercation. “Did I ask you for your advice, or did you think me such a sucker that I couldn't move without it? You speak when you are spoken to, and by the Lord you'd have to wait a long time if it was me!” He thrust out his face and grinned at the patrolmen like a snarling dog.

“我的朋友和你有什么关系?”麦克默多吼道，这声音把车厢里的每个人都吸引过来目睹了这场争吵。“我是向你请教了，还是你认为我是个笨蛋，没有它我就动不了？有人跟你说话的时候你就说话，如果是我的话，上帝会让你等很长时间的!”他伸出脸，像一只咆哮的狗一样对着巡警咧嘴一笑。

The two policemen, heavy, good-natured men, were taken aback by the extraordinary vehemence with which their friendly advances had been rejected.

那两个体格魁伟、心地善良的警察被他们的友好求爱遭到拒绝时那种异乎寻常的激烈态度吓了一跳。

“No offense, stranger,” said one. “It was a warning for your own good, seeing that you are, by your own showing, new to the place.”

“无意冒犯，陌生人,”其中一个说。“这是对你好的一个警告，因为从你自己的表现来看，你是这个地方的新手。”

“I'm new to the place; but I'm not new to you and your kind!” cried McMurdo in cold fury. “I guess you're the same in all places, shoving your advice in when nobody asks for it.”

“我对这个地方是新来的，但对你和你的同类来说，我不是新来的!”麦克默多站冷冷地愤怒地喊道。“我猜你在任何地方都是一样的，在没人问你意见的时候硬塞进去。”

“Maybe we'll see more of you before very long,” said one of the patrolmen with a grin. “You're a real hand-picked one, if I am a judge.”

“也许不久以后我们会经常见到你们,”其中一个巡警咧嘴笑着说。“如果我是法官的话，你真是个精挑细选的人。”

“I was thinking the same,” remarked the other. “I guess we may meet again.”

“我也是这么想的,”另一个说，“我想我们还会再见面的。”

“I'm not afraid of you, and don't you think it!” cried McMurdo. “My name's Jack McMurdo—see? If you want me, you'll find me at Jacob Shafter's on Sheridan Street, Vermissa; so I'm not hiding from you, am I? Day or night I dare to look the like of you in the face—don't make any mistake about that!”

“我不怕你，你不觉得吗?”麦克默多喊道。“我的名字是杰克 · 麦克默多——看到了吗？如果你需要我，你可以在 Sheridan Street 的 Jacob Shafter 找到我，维米萨，所以我没有躲着你，是吗？不管白天黑夜，我都敢直视你的脸，不要犯任何错误!”

There was a murmur of sympathy and admiration from the miners at the dauntless demeanour of the newcomer, while the two policemen shrugged their shoulders and renewed a conversation between themselves.

矿工们窃窃私语，对这个新来的人的无耻行为表示同情和钦佩。两个警察耸了耸肩，重新开始了他们之间的谈话。

A few minutes later the train ran into the ill-lit station, and there was a general clearing; for Vermissa was by far the largest town on the line. McMurdo picked up his leather gripsack and was about to start off into the darkness, when one of the miners accosted him.

几分钟后，火车驶进了灯光昏暗的车站，那里一片空旷，因为到目前为止，韦尔米萨是这条线上最大的城镇。麦克默多捡起他的皮手提袋，正要出发进入黑暗之中，这时一个矿工向他走来。

“By Gar, mate! you know how to speak to the cops,” he said in a voice of awe. “It was grand to hear you. Let me carry your grip and show you the road. I'm passing Shafter's on the way to my own shack.”

“哎呀，伙计！”你知道怎么跟警察说话”他用一种敬畏的声音说。“听到你的声音真是太好了。让我帮你牵着手，给你指路。我经过沙夫特，正要去我自己的小屋。”

There was a chorus of friendly “Good-nights” from the other miners as they passed from the platform. Before ever he had set foot in it, McMurdo the turbulent had become a character in Vermissa.

当其他矿工从平台上走过时，他们友好地齐声说了“晚安”。在他踏上这片土地之前，动荡的麦克默多站已经成为 Vermissa 的一个特征。

The country had been a place of terror; but the town was in its way even more depressing. Down that long valley there was at least a certain gloomy grandeur in the huge fires and the clouds of drifting smoke, while the strength and industry of man found fitting monuments in the hills which he had spilled by the side of his monstrous excavations. But the town showed a dead level of mean ugliness and squalor. The broad street was churned up by the traffic into a horrible rutted paste of muddy snow. The sidewalks were narrow and uneven. The numerous gas-lamps served only to show more clearly a long line of wooden houses, each with its veranda facing the street, unkempt and dirty.

这个国家曾经是一个恐怖的地方，但是这个城镇却变得更加令人沮丧。沿着那长长的山谷，在巨大的火焰和飘浮的烟雾中，至少有一种阴郁的庄严，而人类的力量和勤奋在他那庞大的挖掘工地旁边的山丘上找到了合适的纪念碑。但是这个城镇却显得极其丑陋和肮脏。宽阔的街道被车辆搅成了一团可怕的有车辙的泥泞的雪团。人行道又窄又不平。众多的煤气灯只能更清楚地显示出一长排木头房子，每个房子的走廊都面对着街道，蓬乱而肮脏。

As they approached the centre of the town the scene was brightened by a row of well-lit stores, and even more by a cluster of saloons and gaming houses, in which the miners spent their hard-earned but generous wages.

当他们接近市中心时，一排灯火通明的商店，甚至更多的是一群酒吧和赌场，矿工们在这里花费了他们辛苦赚来的但是慷慨的工资。

“That's the Union House,” said the guide, pointing to one saloon which rose almost to the dignity of being a hotel. “Jack McGinty is the boss there.”

“那是联合大厦,”导游指着一家几乎有旅馆气派的大厅说。“杰克 · 麦金蒂是那里的老板。”

“What sort of a man is he?” McMurdo asked.

“他是什么样的人?”麦克默多站问道。

“What! have you never heard of the boss?”

“什么! 你没听说过老板吗?”

“How could I have heard of him when you know that I am a stranger in these parts?”

“你知道我在这里是个陌生人，我怎么会听说过他呢?”

“Well, I thought his name was known clear across the country. It's been in the papers often enough.”

“嗯，我以为他的名字在全国都很清楚。报纸上经常登这个名字。”

“What for?”

“为什么?”

“Well,” the miner lowered his voice—“over the affairs.”

“好吧,”矿工压低了声音——“对于这些事情。”

“What affairs?”

“什么风流韵事?”

“Good Lord, mister! you are queer, if I must say it without offense. There's only one set of affairs that you'll hear of in these parts, and that's the affairs of the Scowrers.”

“天哪，先生！如果我必须毫无冒犯之意地说出来的话，你是个同性恋。在这个地方，你只会听到一种说法，那就是斯科勒家的事。”

“Why, I seem to have read of the Scowrers in Chicago. A gang of murderers, are they not?”

“为什么，我似乎读到过芝加哥的记者，他们是一伙杀人犯，不是吗?”

“Hush, on your life!” cried the miner, standing still in alarm, and gazing in amazement at his companion. “Man, you won't live long in these parts if you speak in the open street like that. Many a man has had the life beaten out of him for less.”

“嘘，我发誓!”矿工惊恐地站着不动，惊奇地盯着他的同伴叫道。“伙计，如果你在大街上这样说话，你在这儿就活不长了。许多人为了更少的钱被打死了。”

“Well, I know nothing about them. It's only what I have read.”

“嗯，我对他们一无所知。这只是我所读到的。”

“And I'm not saying that you have not read the truth.” The man looked nervously round him as he spoke, peering into the shadows as if he feared to see some lurking danger. “If killing is murder, then God knows there is murder and to spare. But don't you dare to breathe the name of Jack McGinty in connection with it, stranger; for every whisper goes back to him, and he is not one that is likely to let it pass. Now, that's the house you're after, that one standing back from the street. You'll find old Jacob Shafter that runs it as honest a man as lives in this township.”

“我并不是说你没有读过真相。”那人说话时紧张地环顾四周，凝视着阴影，仿佛害怕看到潜伏的危险。“如果杀人就是谋杀，那么上帝知道还有谋杀。但是，陌生人，你千万不要把杰克 · 麦金蒂的名字和这件事联系在一起，因为每一个耳语都会回到他的耳朵里，他不会让这个耳语溜走的。这就是你要找的房子，那个站在街边的房子。你会发现老雅各布 · 沙福特经营着这个镇，他和镇上的人一样诚实。”

“I thank you,” said McMurdo, and shaking hands with his new acquaintance he plodded, gripsack in hand, up the path which led to the dwelling house, at the door of which he gave a resounding knock.

“我谢谢你,”麦克默多站说着，和他的新朋友握了握手，手里拿着手袋，缓缓地走上通往住宅的小路，在门口他发出了响亮的敲门声。

It was opened at once by someone very different from what he had expected. It was a woman, young and singularly beautiful. She was of the German type, blonde and fair-haired, with the piquant contrast of a pair of beautiful dark eyes with which she surveyed the stranger with surprise and a pleasing embarrassment which brought a wave of colour over her pale face. Framed in the bright light of the open doorway, it seemed to McMurdo that he had never seen a more beautiful picture; the more attractive for its contrast with the sordid and gloomy surroundings. A lovely violet growing upon one of those black slag-heaps of the mines would not have seemed more surprising. So entranced was he that he stood staring without a word, and it was she who broke the silence.

它立刻被一个与他所期望的完全不同的人打开了。那是一个女人，年轻，非常漂亮。她是个德国人，金发碧眼，一头金发，一双美丽的黑眼睛形成调皮的对比，她惊奇地打量着这个陌生人，脸色苍白，带着一种令人愉快的尴尬。在敞开的门口明亮的灯光下，麦克默多站仿佛觉得他从未见过如此美丽的画面，与周围肮脏阴暗的环境形成对比，这幅画更具吸引力。一朵可爱的紫罗兰长在一堆黑色的矿渣堆上，也不会比这更令人惊讶了。他是如此着迷，以至于他一言不发地站在那里凝视着，是她打破了沉默。

“I thought it was father,” said she with a pleasing little touch of a German accent. “Did you come to see him? He is downtown. I expect him back every minute.”

“我还以为是爸爸呢,”她说，带着一点儿讨人喜欢的德国口音。“你是来看他的吗？他在市中心。我希望他每时每刻都能回来。”

McMurdo continued to gaze at her in open admiration until her eyes dropped in confusion before this masterful visitor.

麦克默多站继续公开赞赏地凝视着她，直到她困惑地垂下眼睛，看着这位专横的客人。

“No, miss,” he said at last, “I'm in no hurry to see him. But your house was recommended to me for board. I thought it might suit me—and now I know it will.”

“不，小姐,”他最后说，“我不急着见他。但是你的房子被推荐给我当食物。我以为它会适合我ーー现在我知道它会适合我了。”

“You are quick to make up your mind,” said she with a smile.

“你很快就下了决心,”她笑着说。

“Anyone but a blind man could do as much,” the other answered.

“除了瞎子，谁都能做得到,”另一个回答说。

She laughed at the compliment. “Come right in, sir,” she said. “I'm Miss Ettie Shafter, Mr. Shafter's daughter. My mother's dead, and I run the house. You can sit down by the stove in the front room until father comes along—Ah, here he is! So you can fix things with him right away.”

她听了这恭维话笑了。“请进，先生,”她说。“我是埃蒂 · 肖夫特小姐，肖夫特先生的女儿。我母亲去世了，我掌管着这个家。你可以坐在客厅的炉子旁边，直到父亲走过来——啊，他来了！所以你可以马上和他解决问题。”

A heavy, elderly man came plodding up the path. In a few words McMurdo explained his business. A man of the name of Murphy had given him the address in Chicago. He in turn had had it from someone else. Old Shafter was quite ready. The stranger made no bones about terms, agreed at once to every condition, and was apparently fairly flush of money. For seven dollars a week paid in advance he was to have board and lodging.

一个身体沉重的老人沿着小路艰难地走来。麦克默多用几句话解释了他的业务。一个叫墨菲的人给了他芝加哥的地址。反过来，他也是从别人那里得到的。老沙夫特已经准备好了。这个陌生人对条款毫不犹豫，对每一个条件都立刻表示同意，而且显然手头很宽裕。他预付了每周七美元的食宿费。

So it was that McMurdo, the self-confessed fugitive from justice, took up his abode under the roof of the Shafters, the first step which was to lead to so long and dark a train of events, ending in a far distant land.

于是，麦克默多站，这个自认逃亡的罪犯，住进了他的屋檐下，第一步就是走向一系列漫长而黑暗的事件，最终到达一个遥远的国度。
