The police trial had passed, in which the case of John Douglas was referred to a higher court. So had the Quarter Sessions, at which he was acquitted as having acted in self-defense.

警方的审判已经通过，约翰 · 道格拉斯的案件被提交到更高一级的法院。季度会议也是如此，在那次会议上，他被宣告无罪，因为他是出于自卫。

“Get him out of England at any cost,” wrote Holmes to the wife. “There are forces here which may be more dangerous than those he has escaped. There is no safety for your husband in England.”

“不惜一切代价把他赶出英格兰,”福尔摩斯写信给妻子。“这里可能有比他逃出来的更危险的势力。你丈夫在英国没有安全可言。”

Two months had gone by, and the case had to some extent passed from our minds. Then one morning there came an enigmatic note slipped into our letter box. “Dear me, Mr. Holmes. Dear me!” said this singular epistle. There was neither superscription nor signature. I laughed at the quaint message; but Holmes showed unwonted seriousness.

两个月过去了，这件事在某种程度上已经从我们的脑海中消失了。一天早晨，我们的信箱里塞进了一张神秘莫测的纸条。“天哪，福尔摩斯先生。天哪!”这封奇怪的信上说。上面既没有标号，也没有签名。我听到这个奇怪的消息，不禁笑了起来，但福尔摩斯却显得异乎寻常的严肃。

“Deviltry, Watson!” he remarked, and sat long with a clouded brow.

“恶魔，华生!”他说，然后坐了很长时间，眉宇间皱着眉头。

Late last night Mrs. Hudson, our landlady, brought up a message that a gentleman wished to see Holmes, and that the matter was of the utmost importance. Close at the heels of his messenger came Cecil Barker, our friend of the moated Manor House. His face was drawn and haggard.

昨天深夜，我们的房东太太哈德森太太带来一封信，说有一位先生想见福尔摩斯，这件事非常重要。紧随其后的是他的信使塞西尔巴克，我们的朋友护城河庄园。他的面容憔悴。

“I've had bad news—terrible news, Mr. Holmes,” said he.

“我有一个坏消息ーー可怕的消息，福尔摩斯先生,”他说。

“I feared as much,” said Holmes.

“我也很害怕,”福尔摩斯说。

“You have not had a cable, have you?”

“你没有电报吧?”

“I have had a note from someone who has.”

“我收到了一个人的留言。”

“It's poor Douglas. They tell me his name is Edwards; but he will always be Jack Douglas of Benito Canyon to me. I told you that they started together for South Africa in the Palmyra three weeks ago.”

“是可怜的道格拉斯。他们告诉我他的名字是爱德华兹，但对我来说他永远是 Benito Canyon 的杰克 · 道格拉斯。我告诉过你，三周前，他们一起从帕尔迈拉出发去南非。”

“Exactly.”

“没错。”

“The ship reached Cape Town last night. I received this cable from Mrs. Douglas this morning:—

“船昨晚到达了开普敦。今天早上我收到了道格拉斯夫人的电报: ー

“Jack has been lost overboard in gale off St. Helena. No one knows how accident occurred.

“杰克在圣赫勒拿岛附近的大风中落水，没有人知道事故是如何发生的。

— “Ivy Douglas.”

ー“ Ivy Douglas”

“Ha! It came like that, did it?” said Holmes, thoughtfully. “Well, I've no doubt it was well stage-managed.”

“哈! 就是这样，对吧?”福尔摩斯若有所思地说。“嗯，我毫不怀疑这是精心策划的。”

“You mean that you think there was no accident?”

“你是说你认为这不是意外?”

“None in the world.”

“世界上没有。”

“He was murdered?”

“他是被谋杀的?”

“Surely!”

“当然!”

“So I think also. These infernal Scowrers, this cursed vindictive nest of criminals—”

“我也是这么想的。这些该死的记者，这个该死的报复性的罪犯巢穴——”

“No, no, my good sir,” said Holmes. “There is a master hand here. It is no case of sawed-off shot-guns and clumsy six-shooters. You can tell an old master by the sweep of his brush. I can tell a Moriarty when I see one. This crime is from London, not from America.”

“不，不，我的好先生,”福尔摩斯说。“这里有一位大师。这不是短管子弹枪和笨拙的六发手枪的问题。你可以从一个老师刷子的扫描看出他是谁。我一看到莫里亚蒂就能分辨出来。这起犯罪来自伦敦，而不是美国。”

“But for what motive?”

“但动机是什么呢?”

“Because it is done by a man who cannot afford to fail—one whose whole unique position depends upon the fact that all he does must succeed. A great brain and a huge organization have been turned to the extinction of one man. It is crushing the nut with the hammer—an absurd extravagance of energy—but the nut is very effectually crushed all the same.”

“因为这是由一个不能承受失败的人来完成的——这个人的整个独特地位取决于这样一个事实: 他所做的一切都必须成功。一个伟大的头脑和庞大的组织已经变成了一个人的灭亡。它是用锤子粉碎坚果——这是一种荒谬的能量浪费——但坚果仍然被非常有效地粉碎。”

“How came this man to have anything to do with it?”

“这个人怎么会和这件事有关系呢?”

“I can only say that the first word that ever came to us of the business was from one of his lieutenants. These Americans were well advised. Having an English job to do, they took into partnership, as any foreign criminal could do, this great consultant in crime. From that moment their man was doomed. At first he would content himself by using his machinery in order to find their victim. Then he would indicate how the matter might be treated. Finally, when he read in the reports of the failure of this agent, he would step in himself with a master touch. You heard me warn this man at Birlstone Manor House that the coming danger was greater than the past. Was I right?”

“我只能说，我们听到的关于这个行业的第一个词是他的一位副手说的。这些美国人得到了很好的建议。由于要做一份英国人的工作，他们像任何外国罪犯一样，与这位伟大的犯罪顾问建立了伙伴关系。从那一刻起，他们的男人就注定要失败。起初，他会满足于使用他的机器，以便找到他们的受害者。然后他会指出如何处理这个问题。最后，当他读到关于这个特工失败的报告时，他会以一种高超的手法介入。你听到我在伯尔斯通庄园警告这个人，即将到来的危险比过去更大。我说的对吗?”

Barker beat his head with his clenched fist in his impotent anger.

巴克在他无力的愤怒中用他紧握的拳头打他的头。

“Do you tell me that we have to sit down under this? Do you say that no one can ever get level with this king-devil?”

“你告诉我，我们必须坐在这下面吗？你是说没有人能和这个国王魔鬼扯上关系吗?”

“No, I don't say that,” said Holmes, and his eyes seemed to be looking far into the future. “I don't say that he can't be beat. But you must give me time—you must give me time!”

“不，我不是那个意思,”福尔摩斯说，他的眼睛似乎看到了遥远的未来。“我不是说他不会被打败。但你必须给我时间——你必须给我时间!”

We all sat in silence for some minutes, while those fateful eyes still strained to pierce the veil.

我们都静静地坐了几分钟，那双宿命般的眼睛仍然紧张地盯着面纱。
