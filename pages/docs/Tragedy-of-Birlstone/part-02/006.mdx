}

It was the height of the reign of terror. McMurdo, who had already been appointed Inner Deacon, with every prospect of some day succeeding McGinty as Bodymaster, was now so necessary to the councils of his comrades that nothing was done without his help and advice. The more popular he became, however, with the Freemen, the blacker were the scowls which greeted him as he passed along the streets of Vermissa. In spite of their terror the citizens were taking heart to band themselves together against their oppressors. Rumours had reached the lodge of secret gatherings in the Herald office and of distribution of firearms among the law-abiding people. But McGinty and his men were undisturbed by such reports. They were numerous, resolute, and well armed. Their opponents were scattered and powerless. It would all end, as it had done in the past, in aimless talk and possibly in impotent arrests. So said McGinty, McMurdo, and all the bolder spirits.

那是恐怖统治的鼎盛时期。麦克默多站已经被任命为内执事，有朝一日接替麦金蒂担任身体主管的前景一片光明，现在对于他的同志们来说是如此必要，没有他的帮助和建议，什么事情也做不成。然而，随着他在自由人中越来越受欢迎，当他走过 Vermissa 的街道时，迎接他的面颊变得越来越黑。尽管有恐怖行为，市民们还是鼓起勇气团结起来反抗压迫者。先驱报办公室的秘密集会和在守法公民中分发武器的谣言已经传开。但是麦金蒂和他的手下并没有受到这些报道的干扰。他们人数众多，意志坚定，装备精良。他们的对手四分五裂，无能为力。一切都将结束，就像过去一样，在漫无目的的谈话中，可能在无力的逮捕中结束。麦金蒂、麦克默多站以及所有胆子大的人都是这么说的。

It was a Saturday evening in May. Saturday was always the lodge night, and McMurdo was leaving his house to attend it when Morris, the weaker brother of the order, came to see him. His brow was creased with care, and his kindly face was drawn and haggard.

那是五月的一个星期六晚上。星期六总是住宿的夜晚，麦克默多正要离开家去参加，这时，教会中较弱的兄弟莫里斯来看他。他的额头因忧虑而皱了起来，他那和蔼的脸显得憔悴而憔悴。

“Can I speak with you freely, Mr. McMurdo?”

“麦克默多先生，我可以和你畅所欲言吗?”

“Sure.”

“当然。”

“I can't forget that I spoke my heart to you once, and that you kept it to yourself, even though the Boss himself came to ask you about it.”

“我不能忘记，我曾经对你说过我的心，而你却把它藏在心里，即使老板亲自来问过你这件事。”

“What else could I do if you trusted me? It wasn't that I agreed with what you said.”

“如果你信任我，我还能做什么? 我不是同意你说的话。”

“I know that well. But you are the one that I can speak to and be safe. I've a secret here,” he put his hand to his breast, “and it is just burning the life out of me. I wish it had come to any one of you but me. If I tell it, it will mean murder, for sure. If I don't, it may bring the end of us all. God help me, but I am near out of my wits over it!”

”“我知道。但是你是那个我可以安全地和你说话的人。“我有一个秘密,”他把手放在胸前，“它正在烧死我。”。我希望这事发生在你们中的任何一个人身上，而不是我。如果我说了，那肯定意味着谋杀。如果我不这么做，我们所有人都会完蛋。上帝保佑我，但是我对这件事几乎失去了理智!”

McMurdo looked at the man earnestly. He was trembling in every limb. He poured some whisky into a glass and handed it to him. “That's the physic for the likes of you,” said he. “Now let me hear of it.”

麦克默多站认真地看着这个人。他四肢发抖。他往杯子里倒了一些威士忌，递给他。“对你这样的人来说，这是一剂良药,”他说。“现在让我听听。”

Morris drank, and his white face took a tinge of colour. “I can tell it to you all in one sentence,” said he. “There's a detective on our trail.”

莫里斯喝了一口酒，他那白皙的脸上露出了一丝红晕。“我可以用一句话告诉你们所有人,”他说。“有个侦探在跟踪我们。”

McMurdo stared at him in astonishment. “Why, man, you're crazy,” he said. “Isn't the place full of police and detectives and what harm did they ever do us?”

麦克默多站惊讶地盯着他。“嘿，伙计，你疯了,”他说。“这个地方不是到处都是警察和侦探吗? 他们对我们有什么害处?”

“No, no, it's no man of the district. As you say, we know them, and it is little that they can do. But you've heard of Pinkerton's?”

”“不，不，不是这个地区的人。正如你所说，我们了解他们，他们能做的很少。但你听说过平克顿吧?”

“I've read of some folk of that name.”

“我听说有人叫这个名字。”

“Well, you can take it from me you've no show when they are on your trail. It's not a take-it-or-miss-it government concern. It's a dead earnest business proposition that's out for results and keeps out till by hook or crook it gets them. If a Pinkerton man is deep in this business, we are all destroyed.”

”“好吧，你可以从我这里拿走，他们跟踪你的时候你没有露面。这不是政府关心的问题。这是一个非常认真的商业提议，它要求结果，不择手段地拒绝，直到它得到它们。如果一个平克顿人深陷于这件事中，我们就都完了。”

“We must kill him.”

“我们必须杀了他。”

“Ah, it's the first thought that came to you! So it will be up at the lodge. Didn't I say to you that it would end in murder?”

“啊，这是你的第一个念头！所以它会在小屋里。我不是跟你说过这会以谋杀收场吗?”

“Sure, what is murder? Isn't it common enough in these parts?”

“当然，什么是谋杀? 难道在这些地方还不够常见吗?”

“It is, indeed; but it's not for me to point out the man that is to be murdered. I'd never rest easy again. And yet it's our own necks that may be at stake. In God's name what shall I do?” He rocked to and fro in his agony of indecision.

”“的确是这样，但是我不能指出那个要被谋杀的人。我再也不能安心了。然而，我们自己的脖子可能处于危险之中。看在上帝的份上，我该怎么办?”他在犹豫不决的痛苦中来回摇晃。

But his words had moved McMurdo deeply. It was easy to see that he shared the other's opinion as to the danger, and the need for meeting it. He gripped Morris's shoulder and shook him in his earnestness.

但是他的话深深地打动了麦克默多。显而易见，他同意对方关于危险的看法，认为有必要迎合危险。他抓住莫里斯的肩膀，一本正经地摇了摇他。

“See here, man,” he cried, and he almost screeched the words in his excitement, “you won't gain anything by sitting keening like an old wife at a wake. Let's have the facts. Who is the fellow? Where is he? How did you hear of him? Why did you come to me?”

“听着，伙计,”他喊道，激动得几乎尖叫起来，“你坐在那儿哭哭啼啼，像个守灵的老太太，什么也得不到。让我们来看看事实。那家伙是谁？他在哪儿？你是怎么听说他的？你为什么来找我?”

“I came to you; for you are the one man that would advise me. I told you that I had a store in the East before I came here. I left good friends behind me, and one of them is in the telegraph service. Here's a letter that I had from him yesterday. It's this part from the top of the page. You can read it yourself.”

”“我来找你，因为你是唯一一个可以给我建议的人。我告诉过你我来这里之前在东部有一家店。我离开了好朋友，其中一个在电报局工作。这是我昨天收到的他的一封信。这是从页面顶部开始的部分。你可以自己看。”

This was what McMurdo read:

这是麦克默多站所读到的:

How are the Scowrers getting on in your parts? We read plenty of them in the papers. Between you and me I expect to hear news from you before long. Five big corporations and the two railroads have taken the thing up in dead earnest. They mean it, and you can bet they'll get there! They are right deep down into it. Pinkerton has taken hold under their orders, and his best man, Birdy Edwards, is operating. The thing has got to be stopped right now.

你那边的新闻记者进行得怎么样了？我们在报纸上读了很多。我希望不久就能从你那里得到消息，这是你我之间的秘密。五家大公司和两家铁路公司已经认真对待这件事。他们是认真的，你可以打赌他们会成功的！他们正好深入其中。平克顿已经在他们的命令下站稳了脚跟，他的伴郎伯蒂 · 爱德华兹正在进行手术。这件事必须马上停止。

“Now read the postscript.”

“现在读一下附言。”

Of course, what I give you is what I learned in business; so it goes no further. It's a queer cipher that you handle by the yard every day and can get no meaning from.

当然，我给你们的是我在商业中学到的东西，所以不会再进一步了。这是一个奇怪的密码，你每天在院子里处理，从中得不到任何意义。

McMurdo sat in silence for some time, with the letter in his listless hands. The mist had lifted for a moment, and there was the abyss before him.

麦克默多无精打采地拿着那封信，默默地坐了一会儿。雾消散了一会儿，他面前是一个深渊。

“Does anyone else know of this?” he asked.

“还有其他人知道这件事吗?”他问。

“I have told no one else.”

“我没有告诉任何人。”

“But this man—your friend—has he any other person that he would be likely to write to?”

“但是这个人ーー你的朋友ーー他还会给其他人写信吗?”

“Well, I dare say he knows one or two more.”

“嗯，我敢说他还知道一两个。”

“Of the lodge?”

“旅馆的?”

“It's likely enough.”

“这很有可能。”

“I was asking because it is likely that he may have given some description of this fellow Birdy Edwards—then we could get on his trail.”

“我之所以问这个问题，是因为他很可能描述了这个鸟人爱德华兹的一些情况ーー这样我们就能追踪到他的踪迹。”

“Well, it's possible. But I should not think he knew him. He is just telling me the news that came to him by way of business. How would he know this Pinkerton man?”

“嗯，这是有可能的。但是我不认为他认识他。他只是告诉我他因为生意上的原因得到的消息。他怎么会认识这个平克顿人呢?”

McMurdo gave a violent start.

麦克默多站一开始就很暴力。

“By Gar!” he cried, “I've got him. What a fool I was not to know it. Lord! but we're in luck! We will fix him before he can do any harm. See here, Morris, will you leave this thing in my hands?”

“被加!”他喊道: “我抓住他了。我居然不知道这件事，真是个傻瓜。主啊！但是我们很幸运！在他造成任何伤害之前，我们会治好他的。听着，莫里斯，你能把这件事交给我吗?”

“Sure, if you will only take it off mine.”

“当然，只要你把它从我的上面拿下来。”

“I'll do that. You can stand right back and let me run it. Even your name need not be mentioned. I'll take it all on myself, as if it were to me that this letter has come. Will that content you?”

“我会的。你可以站在后面让我来操作。甚至你的名字也不必提及。我要把这一切都算在自己头上，就好像这封信是我收到的一样。这样你满意吗?”

“It's just what I would ask.”

“这正是我想问的。”

“Then leave it at that and keep your head shut. Now I'll get down to the lodge, and we'll soon make old man Pinkerton sorry for himself.”

“那就这样吧，把你的头闭上。现在我要下楼到小屋里去，我们很快就会让老平克顿为自己感到难过。”

“You wouldn't kill this man?”

“你不会杀了这个人?”

“The less you know, Friend Morris, the easier your conscience will be, and the better you will sleep. Ask no questions, and let these things settle themselves. I have hold of it now.”

“你知道的越少，弗兰德 · 莫里斯，你的良心就越安慰，你就会睡得越好。不要问问题，让这些事情自己解决。我现在拿着它。”

Morris shook his head sadly as he left. “I feel that his blood is on my hands,” he groaned.

莫里斯离开时伤心地摇了摇头。“我感到我的双手沾满了他的鲜血,”他呻吟道。

“Self-protection is no murder, anyhow,” said McMurdo, smiling grimly. “It's him or us. I guess this man would destroy us all if we left him long in the valley. Why, Brother Morris, we'll have to elect you Bodymaster yet; for you've surely saved the lodge.”

“无论如何，自我保护不是谋杀,”麦克默多站冷冷地笑着说。“不是他死就是我们亡。我想如果我们把他长时间留在山谷里，这个人会毁了我们所有人。莫里斯兄弟，我们还是要选你当身体主人，因为你肯定拯救了这个小屋。”

And yet it was clear from his actions that he thought more seriously of this new intrusion than his words would show. It may have been his guilty conscience, it may have been the reputation of the Pinkerton organization, it may have been the knowledge that great, rich corporations had set themselves the task of clearing out the Scowrers; but, whatever his reason, his actions were those of a man who is preparing for the worst. Every paper which would incriminate him was destroyed before he left the house. After that he gave a long sigh of satisfaction; for it seemed to him that he was safe. And yet the danger must still have pressed somewhat upon him; for on his way to the lodge he stopped at old man Shafter's. The house was forbidden him; but when he tapped at the window Ettie came out to him. The dancing Irish deviltry had gone from her lover's eyes. She read his danger in his earnest face.

然而，从他的行动中可以清楚地看出，他对这种新的入侵行为的看法，比他的言辞所表现出来的要严肃得多。也许是因为他的内疚感，也许是因为平克顿组织的声誉，也许是因为他知道富有的大公司已经为自己设定了清除斯考勒家族成员的任务; 但是，不管他的理由是什么，他的行为都是一个做最坏打算的人的行为。在他离开家之前，所有能证明他有罪的文件都被销毁了。之后，他满意地长叹了一口气，因为他觉得自己安全了。然而，危险还是压在他的身上，因为他在去小屋的路上，在沙夫特老人家停了下来。这所房子是禁止他进入的，但是当他敲打着窗户的时候，埃蒂走了出来。在她情人的眼里，跳舞的爱尔兰恶魔已经消失了。她从他诚挚的脸上看出了他的危险。

“Something has happened!” she cried. “Oh, Jack, you are in danger!”

“出事了!”她喊道，“哦，杰克，你有危险了!”

“Sure, it is not very bad, my sweetheart. And yet it may be wise that we make a move before it is worse.”

“当然，不是很糟糕，我的甜心。不过，在事态恶化之前采取行动，或许是明智之举。”

“Make a move?”

“采取行动?”

“I promised you once that I would go some day. I think the time is coming. I had news to-night, bad news, and I see trouble coming.”

“我答应过你一次，总有一天我会去的。我认为时间快到了。我今天晚上有个坏消息，我看到麻烦要来了。”

“The police?”

“警察?”

“Well, a Pinkerton. But, sure, you wouldn't know what that is, acushla, nor what it may mean to the likes of me. I'm too deep in this thing, and I may have to get out of it quick. You said you would come with me if I went.”

“好吧，平克顿家的人。但是，当然，你不会知道那是什么，acushla，也不会知道它对我这样的人意味着什么。我已经陷得太深了，可能得尽快脱身。你说过如果我去的话你会跟我一起去的。”

“Oh, Jack, it would be the saving of you!”

“哦，杰克，这样就可以救你了!”

“I'm an honest man in some things, Ettie. I wouldn't hurt a hair of your bonny head for all that the world can give, nor ever pull you down one inch from the golden throne above the clouds where I always see you. Would you trust me?”

“在某些事情上，我是一个诚实的人，Ettie。我不会伤害你漂亮的头发，因为这个世界可以给你一切，也不会把你从我常看见你的云端的金色宝座上拉下一寸。你会相信我吗?”

She put her hand in his without a word. “Well, then, listen to what I say, and do as I order you, for indeed it's the only way for us. Things are going to happen in this valley. I feel it in my bones. There may be many of us that will have to look out for ourselves. I'm one, anyhow. If I go, by day or night, it's you that must come with me!”

她一言不发地把手放在他的手里。”“好吧，那么，听我说，照我吩咐你的去做，因为这确实是我们唯一的办法。这个山谷里会发生很多事情。我从骨子里感觉到了。我们中的许多人可能不得不自己照顾自己。无论如何，我就是其中之一。如果我走了，不管是白天还是晚上，你都必须跟我走!”

“I'd come after you, Jack.”

“我会来找你的，杰克。”

“No, no, you shall come with me. If this valley is closed to me and I can never come back, how can I leave you behind, and me perhaps in hiding from the police with never a chance of a message? It's with me you must come. I know a good woman in the place I come from, and it's there I'd leave you till we can get married. Will you come?”

”“不，不，你应该跟我来。如果这个山谷对我关闭，我再也不能回来，我怎么能离开你，也许我在躲避警察从来没有一个机会的消息？你必须和我一起去。在我来的地方，我认识一个好女人，我会把她留在那里，直到我们结婚。你会来吗?”

“Yes, Jack, I will come.”

“好的，杰克，我会来的。”

“God bless you for your trust in me! It's a fiend out of hell that I should be if I abused it. Now, mark you, Ettie, it will be just a word to you, and when it reaches you, you will drop everything and come right down to the waiting room at the depot and stay there till I come for you.”

“上帝保佑你，因为你信任我！如果我滥用它，我就会成为一个地狱里的恶魔。现在，听好了，伊蒂，这对你只是一句话，当它到达你那里的时候，你就放下一切，直接来到火车站的候车室，呆在那里，直到我来找你。”

“Day or night, I'll come at the word, Jack.”

“无论白天黑夜，只要一声令下，我就来，杰克。”

Somewhat eased in mind, now that his own preparations for escape had been begun, McMurdo went on to the lodge. It had already assembled, and only by complicated signs and counter-signs could he pass through the outer guard and inner guard who close-tiled it. A buzz of pleasure and welcome greeted him as he entered. The long room was crowded, and through the haze of tobacco smoke he saw the tangled black mane of the Bodymaster, the cruel, unfriendly features of Baldwin, the vulture face of Harraway, the secretary, and a dozen more who were among the leaders of the lodge. He rejoiced that they should all be there to take counsel over his news.

现在他自己逃跑的准备工作已经开始，麦克默多站的心情稍稍平静了一些，他继续向旅馆走去。它已经聚集起来了，只有通过复杂的标志和计数器，他才能通过封闭它的外部警卫和内部警卫。当他走进来的时候，迎接他的是一阵愉快和欢迎的嗡嗡声。长长的房间里挤满了人，透过烟雾，他看到了身体大师纠结的黑色鬃毛，鲍德温残忍而不友好的面孔，Harraway 的秃鹫脸，秘书，还有其他一些人，他们都是小屋的领导者。他很高兴，因为他们都应该在那里商议他的消息。

“Indeed, it's glad we are to see you, Brother!” cried the chairman. “There's business here that wants a Solomon in judgment to set it right.”

“真的，很高兴见到你，兄弟!”主席叫道。“这里有企业希望所罗门在审判中纠正错误。”

“It's Lander and Egan,” explained his neighbour as he took his seat. “They both claim the head money given by the lodge for the shooting of old man Crabbe over at Stylestown, and who's to say which fired the bullet?”

“这是兰德尔和伊根,”他的邻居解释说，他坐在他的座位。“他们都要求支部赔偿在 Stylestown 枪杀老人 Crabbe 的头部损失，谁知道是谁开的枪?”

McMurdo rose in his place and raised his hand. The expression of his face froze the attention of the audience. There was a dead hush of expectation.

麦克默多站了起来，举起了手。他脸上的表情冻结了观众的注意力。一片死一般的寂静。

“Eminent Bodymaster,” he said, in a solemn voice, “I claim urgency!”

“杰出的健身大师,”他严肃地说，“我要求紧急!”

“Brother McMurdo claims urgency,” said McGinty. “It's a claim that by the rules of this lodge takes precedence. Now Brother, we attend you.”

“麦克默多兄弟声称情况紧急,”麦金蒂说。“根据这个小屋的规定，这是一个优先权的要求。现在兄弟，我们来服侍你。”

McMurdo took the letter from his pocket.

麦克默多从口袋里掏出那封信。

“Eminent Bodymaster and Brethren,” he said, “I am the bearer of ill news this day; but it is better that it should be known and discussed, than that a blow should fall upon us without warning which would destroy us all. I have information that the most powerful and richest organizations in this state have bound themselves together for our destruction, and that at this very moment there is a Pinkerton detective, one Birdy Edwards, at work in the valley collecting the evidence which may put a rope round the necks of many of us, and send every man in this room into a felon's cell. That is the situation for the discussion of which I have made a claim of urgency.”

“杰出的身体大师和弟兄们,”他说，“今天我就是带来坏消息的人，但是最好让人们知道并讨论这件事，总比一个毫无征兆的打击降临到我们头上，毁灭我们所有人要好。我有消息说这个州最有权力和最富有的组织已经联合起来毁灭我们，此时此刻有一个 Pinkerton 的侦探，一个叫 Birdy Edwards 的，正在山谷里搜集证据，这些证据可能会让我们许多人的脖子上套上一条绳子，把这个房间里的每个人都送进重罪犯的牢房。这就是我提出紧急要求的讨论的情况。”

There was a dead silence in the room. It was broken by the chairman.

会议室里一片死寂，主席打破了这种寂静。

“What is your evidence for this, Brother McMurdo?” he asked.

“你有什么证据，麦克默多修士?”他问。

“It is in this letter which has come into my hands,” said McMurdo. He read the passage aloud. “It is a matter of honour with me that I can give no further particulars about the letter, nor put it into your hands; but I assure you that there is nothing else in it which can affect the interests of the lodge. I put the case before you as it has reached me.”

麦克默多站表示: “我收到的就是这封信。”。他大声朗读这篇文章。”“关系到我的名誉，我不能再详细说明这封信的情况，也不能把它交到你手里; 但是我向你保证，信中没有任何其他内容可以影响到分会的利益。我已经把案子交给你们了。”

“Let me say, Mr. Chairman,” said one of the older brethren, “that I have heard of Birdy Edwards, and that he has the name of being the best man in the Pinkerton service.”

“让我说，主席先生,”其中一位年长的兄弟说，“我听说过伯蒂 · 爱德华兹，他有平克顿服役中最好的人的名字。”

“Does anyone know him by sight?” asked McGinty.

“有人认识他吗?”麦金蒂问。

“Yes,” said McMurdo, “I do.”

“是的,”麦克默多说，“我愿意。”

There was a murmur of astonishment through the hall.

大厅里传来一阵惊讶的低语声。

“I believe we hold him in the hollow of our hands,” he continued with an exulting smile upon his face. “If we act quickly and wisely, we can cut this thing short. If I have your confidence and your help, it is little that we have to fear.”

“我相信我们把他握在我们的手心里,”他继续说道，脸上露出得意的微笑。“如果我们迅速而明智地采取行动，我们就能缩短这件事。如果我有你的信心和你的帮助，我们不必担心。”

“What have we to fear, anyhow? What can he know of our affairs?”

“不管怎样，我们有什么可怕的? 他对我们的事又能知道什么呢?”

“You might say so if all were as stanch as you, Councillor. But this man has all the millions of the capitalists at his back. Do you think there is no weaker brother among all our lodges that could not be bought? He will get at our secrets—maybe has got them already. There's only one sure cure.”

”“如果大家都象您这样坚强的话，您就可以这样说了，议员先生。但是这个人背后有成千上万的资本家。你以为在我们所有的客栈里，没有一个是买不到的弱者吗？他将得到我们的秘密ーー也许已经得到了。只有一种可靠的治疗方法。”

“That he never leaves the valley,” said Baldwin.

“他永远不会离开山谷,”鲍德温说。

McMurdo nodded. “Good for you, Brother Baldwin,” he said. “You and I have had our differences, but you have said the true word to-night.”

麦克默多站点点头。“很好，鲍德温修士,”他说。“你和我有过分歧，但你今晚说的是实话。”

“Where is he, then? Where shall we know him?”

“那么，他在哪里? 我们在哪里可以认识他?”

“Eminent Bodymaster,” said McMurdo, earnestly, “I would put it to you that this is too vital a thing for us to discuss in open lodge. God forbid that I should throw a doubt on anyone here; but if so much as a word of gossip got to the ears of this man, there would be an end of any chance of our getting him. I would ask the lodge to choose a trusty committee, Mr. Chairman—yourself, if I might suggest it, and Brother Baldwin here, and five more. Then I can talk freely of what I know and of what I advise should be done.”

“杰出的健身教练,”麦克默多站诚恳地说，“我想告诉你，这件事对我们来说太重要了，不能在露天会所讨论。上帝不允许我对这里的任何人产生怀疑; 但是如果这个人听到一句流言蜚语，我们抓住他的机会就完了。主席先生，如果我可以提议的话，我想请大家选择一个可靠的委员会——你自己，还有鲍德温修士，还有五个人。然后，我就可以畅所欲言地谈论我所知道的，以及我所建议应该采取的行动。”

The proposition was at once adopted, and the committee chosen. Besides the chairman and Baldwin there were the vulture-faced secretary, Harraway, Tiger Cormac, the brutal young assassin, Carter, the treasurer, and the brothers Willaby, fearless and desperate men who would stick at nothing.

这个提议立即被采纳，委员会作出了选择。除了董事长和鲍德温，还有长着一张秃鹰脸的秘书、 Harraway、老虎 · 科马克、残忍的年轻刺客、财务主管卡特，以及两兄弟威拉比，他们无所畏惧，绝望得不择手段。

The usual revelry of the lodge was short and subdued: for there was a cloud upon the men's spirits, and many there for the first time began to see the cloud of avenging Law drifting up in that serene sky under which they had dwelt so long. The horrors they had dealt out to others had been so much a part of their settled lives that the thought of retribution had become a remote one, and so seemed the more startling now that it came so closely upon them. They broke up early and left their leaders to their council.

因为有一片乌云笼罩着那些人的灵魂，许多人第一次看到复仇之云在他们长久居住的宁静的天空中漂浮起来。他们给别人带来的恐惧已经成为他们定居生活的一部分，以至于报复的想法变得遥不可及，因此，现在这种想法如此接近他们，似乎更令人吃惊。他们很早就分手了，把他们的领导人留给了议会。

“Now, McMurdo!” said McGinty when they were alone. The seven men sat frozen in their seats.

“现在，麦克默多!”当他们单独在一起的时候，麦克金蒂说。七个人呆呆地坐在他们的座位上。

“I said just now that I knew Birdy Edwards,” McMurdo explained. “I need not tell you that he is not here under that name. He's a brave man, but not a crazy one. He passes under the name of Steve Wilson, and he is lodging at Hobson's Patch.”

“我刚才说我认识鸟人爱德华兹,”麦克默多解释说。”“我不需要告诉你，他不是以这个名字来的。他是个勇敢的人，但不是个疯子。他用史蒂夫 · 威尔逊的名字登记住宿在霍布森的地方。”

“How do you know this?”

“你怎么知道的?”

“Because I fell into talk with him. I thought little of it at the time, nor would have given it a second thought but for this letter; but now I'm sure it's the man. I met him on the cars when I went down the line on Wednesday—a hard case if ever there was one. He said he was a reporter. I believed it for the moment. Wanted to know all he could about the Scowrers and what he called ‘the outrages’ for a New York paper. Asked me every kind of question so as to get something. You bet I was giving nothing away. ‘I'd pay for it and pay well,’ said he, ‘if I could get some stuff that would suit my editor.’ I said what I thought would please him best, and he handed me a twenty-dollar bill for my information. ‘There's ten times that for you,’ said he, ‘if you can find me all that I want.’”

“因为我开始和他谈话。当时我没有多想，要不是这封信，我也不会多想，但现在我确信就是那个人。星期三我在车上遇到他的时候，我正在排队——如果有的话，那就是个难题了。他说他是个记者。我暂时相信了。他想知道所有关于《独立报》和他称为纽约报纸的“暴行”的事情。为了得到一些东西，我问了我所有的问题。你打赌我什么都没送出去。他说，如果我能得到一些适合我的编辑的东西，我愿意花钱买这本书，而且价格不菲我说了我认为最能让他高兴的话，他递给我一张二十美元的钞票作为告诉我的信息。“对你来说，有十倍的价钱,”他说，“如果你能找到我想要的一切。”’

“What did you tell him, then?”

“那你跟他说了什么?”

“Any stuff I could make up.”

“任何我能编造出来的东西。”

“How do you know he wasn't a newspaper man?”

“你怎么知道他不是新闻记者?”

“I'll tell you. He got out at Hobson's Patch, and so did I. I chanced into the telegraph bureau, and he was leaving it.

“我来告诉你。他在霍布森的补丁下了车，我也是。我偶然进了电报局，他正要离开。

“‘See here,’ said the operator after he'd gone out, ‘I guess we should charge double rates for this.’—‘I guess you should,’ said I. He had filled the form with stuff that might have been Chinese, for all we could make of it. ‘He fires a sheet of this off every day,’ said the clerk. ‘Yes,’ said I; ‘it's special news for his paper, and he's scared that the others should tap it.’ That was what the operator thought and what I thought at the time; but I think differently now.”

“‘看这儿,’接线员出去后说，‘我想我们应该收双倍价钱。’“我想你应该知道,”我说。他在表格里填了一些可能是中国人的东西，我们只能这样理解。“他每天都会开一张这样的纸,”店员说。“是的,”我说，“这对他的报纸来说是个特别的消息，他害怕别人会去碰它。”这是接线员的想法，也是我当时的想法，但现在我的想法不同了。”

“By Gar! I believe you are right,” said McGinty. “But what do you allow that we should do about it?”

“哎呀! 我相信你是对的,”麦金蒂说。“但是你允许我们应该做些什么呢?”

“Why not go right down now and fix him?” someone suggested.

“为什么不现在就下去修理他呢?”有人建议道。

“Ay, the sooner the better.”

“嗯，越快越好。”

“I'd start this next minute if I knew where we could find him,” said McMurdo. “He's in Hobson's Patch; but I don't know the house. I've got a plan, though, if you'll only take my advice.”

“如果我知道在哪里能找到他，我下一分钟就会开始行动,”麦克默多站表示。”“他住在霍布森小区，但我不认识那房子。不过，我有个计划，只要你听我的劝告。”

“Well, what is it?”

“那么，这是什么?”

“I'll go to the Patch to-morrow morning. I'll find him through the operator. He can locate him, I guess. Well, then I'll tell him that I'm a Freeman myself. I'll offer him all the secrets of the lodge for a price. You bet he'll tumble to it. I'll tell him the papers are at my house, and that it's as much as my life would be worth to let him come while folk were about. He'll see that that's horse sense. Let him come at ten o'clock at night, and he shall see everything. That will fetch him sure.”

”“我明天早上要去修补一下。我会通过接线员找到他。我猜他能找到他。那我就告诉他我也是自由人。我愿意出个价钱把旅馆的所有秘密都告诉他。你打赌他会迷上它的。我会告诉他那些文件在我家里，我的生命就是让他在我们在附近的时候过来。他会明白这是常识。让他晚上十点钟来，他就会看到一切。这肯定会把他抓住的。”

“Well?”

“嗯?”

“You can plan the rest for yourselves. Widow MacNamara's is a lonely house. She's as true as steel and as deaf as a post. There's only Scanlan and me in the house. If I get his promise—and I'll let you know if I do—I'd have the whole seven of you come to me by nine o'clock. We'll get him in. If ever he gets out alive—well, he can talk of Birdy Edwards's luck for the rest of his days!”

“剩下的你们自己计划吧。寡妇麦克纳马拉的房子是一个孤独的。她像钢铁一样真诚，又像柱子一样聋。屋里只有斯坎兰和我。如果我得到了他的承诺ーー如果我得到了，我会让你们知道ーー我会让你们七个人在九点前来找我。我们会把他弄进去的。如果他能活着出来ーー那么，他就可以在他的余生里谈论鸟人爱德华兹的运气了!”

“There's going to be a vacancy at Pinkerton's or I'm mistaken. Leave it at that, McMurdo. At nine to-morrow we'll be with you. You once get the door shut behind him, and you can leave the rest with us.”

“平克顿餐厅将会有一个空缺，或者我搞错了。就这样吧麦克默多站。明天九点钟，我们和你在一起。你只要把他身后的门关上，剩下的就交给我们吧。”
