  book: "The Tragedy of Birlstone"
}

As McMurdo had said, the house in which he lived was a lonely one and very well suited for such a crime as they had planned. It was on the extreme fringe of the town and stood well back from the road. In any other case the conspirators would have simply called out their man, as they had many a time before, and emptied their pistols into his body; but in this instance it was very necessary to find out how much he knew, how he knew it, and what had been passed on to his employers.

正如麦克默多所说，他所居住的房子是一座孤独的房子，非常适合他们计划的犯罪。它位于城镇的边缘，离公路很远。在任何其他情况下，共谋者只需要叫出他们的人，就像他们以前多次做的那样，把他们的手枪对准他的身体; 但是在这种情况下，很有必要弄清楚他知道多少，他是怎么知道的，以及他把什么交给了他的雇主。

It was possible that they were already too late and that the work had been done. If that was indeed so, they could at least have their revenge upon the man who had done it. But they were hopeful that nothing of great importance had yet come to the detective's knowledge, as otherwise, they argued, he would not have troubled to write down and forward such trivial information as McMurdo claimed to have given him. However, all this they would learn from his own lips. Once in their power, they would find a way to make him speak. It was not the first time that they had handled an unwilling witness.

可能他们已经来不及了，工作已经完成了。如果真是这样的话，他们至少可以报复那个杀了他的人。但是他们希望侦探还没有得到任何重要的信息，否则，他们认为，麦克默多声称已经给了他这些琐碎的信息，他不会费力写下并转发。然而，这一切都是从他自己的嘴里学来的。一旦他们掌握了权力，他们就会想办法让他开口说话。这不是他们第一次处理不情愿的证人了。

McMurdo went to Hobson's Patch as agreed. The police seemed to take particular interest in him that morning, and Captain Marvin—he who had claimed the old acquaintance with him at Chicago—actually addressed him as he waited at the station. McMurdo turned away and refused to speak with him. He was back from his mission in the afternoon, and saw McGinty at the Union House.

麦克默多按照约定前往霍布森的派奇。那天早上，警察似乎对他特别感兴趣，马文上尉——他在芝加哥声称与他是老相识——实际上是在车站等他的时候称呼他的。麦克默多转过身去，拒绝和他说话。他下午出差回来，在联合大厦见到了麦金蒂。

“He is coming,” he said.

“他来了,”他说。

“Good!” said McGinty. The giant was in his shirt sleeves, with chains and seals gleaming athwart his ample waistcoat and a diamond twinkling through the fringe of his bristling beard. Drink and politics had made the Boss a very rich as well as powerful man. The more terrible, therefore, seemed that glimpse of the prison or the gallows which had risen before him the night before.

“很好!”麦金蒂说。巨人穿着衬衫袖子，带着链子和印章，在他宽大的背心上闪闪发光，一颗钻石在他竖立的胡须边闪闪发光。酒精和政治使老板既富有又有权势。因此，更可怕的是，他似乎瞥见了前一天晚上在他面前升起的监狱或绞刑架。

“Do you reckon he knows much?” he asked anxiously.

“你认为他知道得多吗?”他焦急地问。

McMurdo shook his head gloomily. “He's been here some time—six weeks at the least. I guess he didn't come into these parts to look at the prospect. If he has been working among us all that time with the railroad money at his back, I should expect that he has got results, and that he has passed them on.”

麦克默多沮丧地摇了摇头。“他来这儿有一段时间了，至少六个星期了。我猜他来这里不是为了看前景的。如果他一直在我们中间工作，背后还有铁路公司的钱，我想他应该已经取得了成果，而且已经把成果传递下去了。”

“There's not a weak man in the lodge,” cried McGinty. “True as steel, every man of them. And yet, by the Lord! there is that skunk Morris. What about him? If any man gives us away, it would be he. I've a mind to send a couple of the boys round before evening to give him a beating up and see what they can get from him.”

“小屋里没有一个软弱的人,”麦金蒂喊道。“他们每个人都像钢铁一样忠诚。然而，以主的名义！那就是臭鼬莫里斯。他怎么了？如果有人出卖我们，那一定是他。我打算在晚上之前派几个孩子过来揍他一顿，看看他们能从他那里得到什么。”

“Well, there would be no harm in that,” McMurdo answered. “I won't deny that I have a liking for Morris and would be sorry to see him come to harm. He has spoken to me once or twice over lodge matters, and though he may not see them the same as you or I, he never seemed the sort that squeals. But still it is not for me to stand between him and you.”

“好吧，那也没什么坏处,”麦克默多回答说。“我不否认我喜欢莫里斯，看到他受到伤害我会很难过。他曾经和我谈过一两次关于小屋的事情，虽然他对这些事情的看法和你我不一样，但他似乎从来不是那种会尖叫的人。但是我仍然不能阻挡他和你。”

“I'll fix the old devil!” said McGinty with an oath. “I've had my eye on him this year past.”

“我要修理这个老魔鬼!”麦金蒂发誓说，“过去一年我一直在注意他。”

“Well, you know best about that,” McMurdo answered. “But whatever you do must be to-morrow; for we must lie low until the Pinkerton affair is settled up. We can't afford to set the police buzzing, to-day of all days.”

“嗯，你最清楚不过了,”麦克默多回答。”“不管你做什么，一定要在明天，因为在平克顿事件解决之前，我们必须保持低调。我们不能让警察整天忙个不停。”

“True for you,” said McGinty. “And we'll learn from Birdy Edwards himself where he got his news if we have to cut his heart out first. Did he seem to scent a trap?”

“对你来说是真的,”麦金蒂说。“如果我们必须先把他的心挖出来，我们还要向 Birdy Edwards 学习他是从哪里得到这个消息的。他是不是嗅到了陷阱的味道?”

McMurdo laughed. “I guess I took him on his weak point,” he said. “If he could get on a good trail of the Scowrers, he's ready to follow it into hell. I took his money,” McMurdo grinned as he produced a wad of dollar notes, “and as much more when he has seen all my papers.”

麦克默多站笑了。“我想我抓住了他的弱点,”他说。“如果他能跟上斯科勒一家的足迹，他就准备跟着它进入地狱。“我拿了他的钱,”麦克默多拿出一叠美元钞票，咧嘴笑着说，“等他看完我所有的文件，就更多了。”

“What papers?”

“什么文件?”

“Well, there are no papers. But I filled him up about constitutions and books of rules and forms of membership. He expects to get right down to the end of everything before he leaves.”

”“好吧，没有文件。但是我给他讲了很多关于章程、规则和成员形式的书籍。他希望在离开之前把一切都做完。”

“Faith, he's right there,” said McGinty grimly. “Didn't he ask you why you didn't bring him the papers?”

“真的，他就在那儿,”麦金蒂冷冷地说，“他没问你为什么不把文件给他吗?”

“As if I would carry such things, and me a suspected man, and Captain Marvin after speaking to me this very day at the depot!”

“好像我会搬这些东西似的，我是个嫌疑犯，马文船长今天就在火车站跟我说过话!”

“Ay, I heard of that,” said McGinty. “I guess the heavy end of this business is coming on to you. We could put him down an old shaft when we've done with him; but however we work it we can't get past the man living at Hobson's Patch and you being there to-day.”

“啊，我听说过,”麦金蒂说。“我想这件事的重头戏正在向你袭来。我们可以把他扔到一个旧坑里，但是不管我们怎么做，我们都不能越过住在霍布森修道院的那个人和你今天在那里的事。”

McMurdo shrugged his shoulders. “If we handle it right, they can never prove the killing,” said he. “No one can see him come to the house after dark, and I'll lay to it that no one will see him go. Now see here, Councillor, I'll show you my plan and I'll ask you to fit the others into it. You will all come in good time. Very well. He comes at ten. He is to tap three times, and me to open the door for him. Then I'll get behind him and shut it. He's our man then.”

麦克默多耸了耸肩。他说: “如果我们处理得当，他们就永远无法证明这起谋杀。”。”“天黑以后，没有人能看见他来到这所房子，我敢打赌，没有人能看见他离开。听着，议员先生，我给你看看我的计划，请你把其他人也安排进去。你们都会来得及的。很好。他十点钟来。他要敲三下门，我要替他开门。那我就躲到他后面，把门关上。那他就是我们要找的人。”

“That's all easy and plain.”

“这一切都很容易，也很简单。”

“Yes; but the next step wants considering. He's a hard proposition. He's heavily armed. I've fooled him proper, and yet he is likely to be on his guard. Suppose I show him right into a room with seven men in it where he expected to find me alone. There is going to be shooting, and somebody is going to be hurt.”

”“是的，但是下一步需要考虑。他是个难缠的家伙。他全副武装。我把他耍得团团转，但他很可能会提高警惕。假设我把他带进一个房间，里面有七个人，他本来以为只有我一个人。会有枪战，会有人受伤。”

“That's so.”

“没错。”

“And the noise is going to bring every damned copper in the township on top of it.”

“噪音会把镇上所有该死的警察都卷进来。”

“I guess you are right.”

“我想你是对的。”

“This is how I should work it. You will all be in the big room—same as you saw when you had a chat with me. I'll open the door for him, show him into the parlour beside the door, and leave him there while I get the papers. That will give me the chance of telling you how things are shaping. Then I will go back to him with some faked papers. As he is reading them I will jump for him and get my grip on his pistol arm. You'll hear me call and in you will rush. The quicker the better; for he is as strong a man as I, and I may have more than I can manage. But I allow that I can hold him till you come.”

“这就是我应该做的。你们都会在那个大房间里ーー就像你们和我聊天时看到的一样。我去给他开门，把他领到门边的客厅里去，我去拿文件，把他留在那儿。这样我就有机会告诉你事情是怎么发展的。然后我会带着一些伪造的文件回去找他。当他在读的时候，我会跳起来抓住他的手枪。你会听到我的呼唤，你会冲进来。越快越好，因为他和我一样强壮，而我可能会有超过我能力的东西。但我允许我可以扣留他，直到你来。”

“It's a good plan,” said McGinty. “The lodge will owe you a debt for this. I guess when I move out of the chair I can put a name to the man that's coming after me.”

“这是个好计划,”麦金蒂说。”“这次旅馆欠你一个人情。我想当我从椅子上站起来的时候，我就能知道那个追我的人的名字了。”

“Sure, Councillor, I am little more than a recruit,” said McMurdo; but his face showed what he thought of the great man's compliment.

“当然，议员先生，我只不过是个新兵,”麦克默多站说，但他的表情表明了他对这位伟人的恭维的看法。

When he had returned home he made his own preparations for the grim evening in front of him. First he cleaned, oiled, and loaded his Smith & Wesson revolver. Then he surveyed the room in which the detective was to be trapped. It was a large apartment, with a long deal table in the centre, and the big stove at one side. At each of the other sides were windows. There were no shutters on these: only light curtains which drew across. McMurdo examined these attentively. No doubt it must have struck him that the apartment was very exposed for so secret a meeting. Yet its distance from the road made it of less consequence. Finally he discussed the matter with his fellow lodger. Scanlan, though a Scowrer, was an inoffensive little man who was too weak to stand against the opinion of his comrades, but was secretly horrified by the deeds of blood at which he had sometimes been forced to assist. McMurdo told him shortly what was intended.

当他回到家里，他自己做好了准备，迎接眼前这个残酷的夜晚。首先，他洗干净，上油，装上史密斯威森左轮手枪的子弹。然后他环视了一下将要抓捕侦探的房间。这是一套大公寓，中间有一张长长的交易桌，一侧有一个大火炉。两边各有一扇窗户。这上面没有百叶窗，只有拉过来的窗帘。麦克默多站仔细研究了这些问题。毫无疑问，他一定很惊讶，因为这么秘密的会议，公寓竟然完全暴露在外面。然而，它离公路的距离使它不那么重要。最后，他和同住的房客讨论了这件事。斯坎兰虽然是一名记者，却是一个无害的小个子，身体虚弱，不能反对同志们的意见，但有时被迫协助的流血事件却让他心惊肉跳。麦克默多很快就告诉了他这么做的目的。

“And if I were you, Mike Scanlan, I would take a night off and keep clear of it. There will be bloody work here before morning.”

“如果我是你，迈克 · 斯坎兰，我会请一晚上的假，远离这一切。明天早上之前这里就会有血淋淋的工作。”

“Well, indeed then, Mac,” Scanlan answered. “It's not the will but the nerve that is wanting in me. When I saw Manager Dunn go down at the colliery yonder it was just more than I could stand. I'm not made for it, same as you or McGinty. If the lodge will think none the worse of me, I'll just do as you advise and leave you to yourselves for the evening.”

“好吧，确实是这样，麦克,”斯坎兰回答。“我缺少的不是意志，而是勇气。当我看到邓恩经理在那边的煤矿倒下时，我简直受不了了。我不适合做这个，就像你和麦金蒂一样。如果旅馆不会把我看得太坏，我就照你的话去做，今晚就让你们自己呆着吧。”

The men came in good time as arranged. They were outwardly respectable citizens, well clad and cleanly; but a judge of faces would have read little hope for Birdy Edwards in those hard mouths and remorseless eyes. There was not a man in the room whose hands had not been reddened a dozen times before. They were as hardened to human murder as a butcher to sheep.

士兵们按照安排及时赶到了。他们表面上是受人尊敬的公民，衣着得体，干净利落; 但是从他们那张硬邦邦的嘴和冷酷无情的眼睛里，判断一个人的长相，可以看出他们对鸟人爱德华兹的希望不大。房间里没有一个人的手以前没有被染红过十几次。他们对人类的谋杀如同屠夫对绵羊一样冷酷无情。

Foremost, of course, both in appearance and in guilt, was the formidable Boss. Harraway, the secretary, was a lean, bitter man with a long, scraggy neck and nervous, jerky limbs, a man of incorruptible fidelity where the finances of the order were concerned, and with no notion of justice or honesty to anyone beyond. The treasurer, Carter, was a middle-aged man, with an impassive, rather sulky expression, and a yellow parchment skin. He was a capable organizer, and the actual details of nearly every outrage had sprung from his plotting brain. The two Willabys were men of action, tall, lithe young fellows with determined faces, while their companion, Tiger Cormac, a heavy, dark youth, was feared even by his own comrades for the ferocity of his disposition. These were the men who assembled that night under the roof of McMurdo for the killing of the Pinkerton detective.

当然，无论是在外表上还是在内疚感上，最重要的是那位令人敬畏的老板。秘书哈拉韦身材瘦削，脾气暴躁，脖子又长又瘦，四肢紧张、抽搐，在维持秩序的财务方面，他是一个不会被收买的人，对外界没有任何正义或诚实的概念。司库卡特是个中年人，面无表情，相当生气，皮肤黄黄的。他是一个能干的组织者，几乎每一起暴行的实际细节都来自于他那思维敏捷的大脑。两个威拉比都是实干家，身材高大，身体柔软，面容坚定，而他们的同伴老虎 · 科马克，一个身材魁梧，皮肤黝黑的年轻人，由于性情凶猛，甚至连他自己的同伴都怕他。他们就是那天晚上聚集在麦克默多站屋檐下谋杀平克顿侦探的人。

Their host had placed whisky upon the table, and they had hastened to prime themselves for the work before them. Baldwin and Cormac were already half-drunk, and the liquor had brought out all their ferocity. Cormac placed his hands on the stove for an instant—it had been lighted, for the nights were still cold.

他们的主人把威士忌酒放在桌上，他们赶紧准备开始面前的工作。鲍德温和科马克已经半醉半醒了，酒已经把他们的凶残暴行显露无遗。科马克把手放在炉子上一会儿，炉子已经点着了，因为夜晚仍然很冷。

“That will do,” said he, with an oath.

“那就行了,”他发誓说。

“Ay,” said Baldwin, catching his meaning. “If he is strapped to that, we will have the truth out of him.”

“是的,”鲍德温说，明白他的意思。“如果他被绑在那里，我们就能从他那里得到真相。”

“We'll have the truth out of him, never fear,” said McMurdo. He had nerves of steel, this man; for though the whole weight of the affair was on him his manner was as cool and unconcerned as ever. The others marked it and applauded.

麦克默多站表示: “我们会让他说出真相，永远不要害怕。”。这个人有钢铁般的意志，因为尽管整个事件都压在他身上，他的态度还是一如既往地冷静和漠不关心。其他人在上面做记号并鼓掌。

“You are the one to handle him,” said the Boss approvingly. “Not a warning will he get till your hand is on his throat. It's a pity there are no shutters to your windows.”

“你是那个处理他的人,”老板赞许地说。“除非你把手放在他的喉咙上，否则他不会得到任何警告。可惜你们的窗户没有百叶窗。”

McMurdo went from one to the other and drew the curtains tighter. “Sure no one can spy upon us now. It's close upon the hour.”

麦克默多站从一个地方走到另一个地方，拉紧了窗帘。“现在当然没有人能监视我们了。时间快到了。”

“Maybe he won't come. Maybe he'll get a sniff of danger,” said the secretary.

“也许他不会来，也许他会察觉到危险,”秘书说。

“He'll come, never fear,” McMurdo answered. “He is as eager to come as you can be to see him. Hark to that!”

“他会来的，别害怕,”麦克默多回答。“他非常想来，就像你想见他一样。听听这个!”

They all sat like wax figures, some with their glasses arrested halfway to their lips. Three loud knocks had sounded at the door.

他们都像蜡像一样坐着，有些人的眼镜被卡在嘴唇的一半。三声响亮的敲门声响了起来。

“Hush!” McMurdo raised his hand in caution. An exulting glance went round the circle, and hands were laid upon hidden weapons.

“嘘!”麦克默多谨慎地举起手。一个兴高采烈的目光环视了一圈，双手放在隐藏的武器上。

“Not a sound, for your lives!” McMurdo whispered, as he went from the room, closing the door carefully behind him.

“为了你们的性命，不要出声!”麦克默多一边走出房间，一边小心翼翼地关上门，低声说道。

With strained ears the murderers waited. They counted the steps of their comrade down the passage. Then they heard him open the outer door. There were a few words as of greeting. Then they were aware of a strange step inside and of an unfamiliar voice. An instant later came the slam of the door and the turning of the key in the lock. Their prey was safe within the trap. Tiger Cormac laughed horribly, and Boss McGinty clapped his great hand across his mouth.

杀人犯们竖起耳朵等待着。他们数着他们的同志走过走廊的步数。然后他们听到他打开了外面的门。有几句话像是问候语。然后他们意识到里面有一个奇怪的脚步和一个陌生的声音。过了一会儿，门砰地一声关上了，钥匙在锁里转动了一下。他们的猎物在陷阱里是安全的。老虎科马克可怕地笑了起来，老板麦金蒂用他的大手捂住了嘴。

“Be quiet, you fool!” he whispered. “You'll be the undoing of us yet!”

“安静点，你这个傻瓜!”他低声说，“你还是会毁了我们的!”

There was a mutter of conversation from the next room. It seemed interminable. Then the door opened, and McMurdo appeared, his finger upon his lip.

隔壁房间传来一阵喃喃的谈话声。这似乎没完没了。然后门开了，麦克默多站出现了，他的手指放在嘴唇上。

He came to the end of the table and looked round at them. A subtle change had come over him. His manner was as of one who has great work to do. His face had set into granite firmness. His eyes shone with a fierce excitement behind his spectacles. He had become a visible leader of men. They stared at him with eager interest; but he said nothing. Still with the same singular gaze he looked from man to man.

他走到桌子的尽头，环顾四周。他身上发生了微妙的变化。他的态度像是一个有大事要做的人。他的脸变得坚定如花岗岩。他的眼镜后面闪烁着极度兴奋的光芒。他已经成为一个引人注目的人类领袖。他们兴致勃勃地盯着他，但他什么也没说。他仍然用同样奇异的目光从一个人看到另一个人。

“Well!” cried Boss McGinty at last. “Is he here? Is Birdy Edwards here?”

“喂!”麦金蒂老板终于喊道，“他在这儿吗? 博蒂 · 爱德华兹在这儿吗?”

“Yes,” McMurdo answered slowly. “Birdy Edwards is here. I am Birdy Edwards!”

“是的,”麦克默多慢吞吞地回答，“鸟人爱德华兹在这里。我是鸟人爱德华兹!”

There were ten seconds after that brief speech during which the room might have been empty, so profound was the silence. The hissing of a kettle upon the stove rose sharp and strident to the ear. Seven white faces, all turned upward to this man who dominated them, were set motionless with utter terror. Then, with a sudden shivering of glass, a bristle of glistening rifle barrels broke through each window, while the curtains were torn from their hangings.

在那简短的演讲之后的十秒钟里，整个房间可能已经空了，寂静是如此深沉。炉子上水壶的嘶嘶声刺耳而尖锐。七张白面朝着这个掌管他们的人，全都惊恐地一动不动地站在那里。接着，随着玻璃的突然震颤，一阵闪闪发光的步枪枪管刺破了每扇窗户，窗帘也从窗帘上扯下来。

At the sight Boss McGinty gave the roar of a wounded bear and plunged for the half-opened door. A levelled revolver met him there with the stern blue eyes of Captain Marvin of the Mine Police gleaming behind the sights. The Boss recoiled and fell back into his chair.

一看见麦金蒂老板就像一只受伤的熊一样怒吼，一头扎进半开的门里。一把瞄准的左轮手枪在那里迎着他，那双警察队长马文的严肃的蓝眼睛在瞄准器后面闪闪发光。老板向后退了一步，倒在椅子上。

“You're safer there, Councillor,” said the man whom they had known as McMurdo. “And you, Baldwin, if you don't take your hand off your pistol, you'll cheat the hangman yet. Pull it out, or by the Lord that made me—There, that will do. There are forty armed men round this house, and you can figure it out for yourself what chance you have. Take their pistols, Marvin!”

“议员先生，你在那儿更安全。”这个人说，他们称他为麦克默多站。“还有你，鲍德温，如果你不把手从你的手枪上拿开，你还是会骗过刽子手的。把它拉出来，或者靠着造我的上帝ーー好了，这样就行了。这座房子周围有四十个全副武装的人，你可以自己想想你有多大的机会。拿上他们的手枪，马文!”

There was no possible resistance under the menace of those rifles. The men were disarmed. Sulky, sheepish, and amazed, they still sat round the table.

在这些步枪的威胁下，不可能有抵抗。那些人被缴械了。他们依然围着桌子坐着，脸色阴沉，羞怯而又惊讶。

“I'd like to say a word to you before we separate,” said the man who had trapped them. “I guess we may not meet again until you see me on the stand in the courthouse. I'll give you something to think over between now and then. You know me now for what I am. At last I can put my cards on the table. I am Birdy Edwards of Pinkerton's. I was chosen to break up your gang. I had a hard and dangerous game to play. Not a soul, not one soul, not my nearest and dearest, knew that I was playing it. Only Captain Marvin here and my employers knew that. But it's over to-night, thank God, and I am the winner!”

“在我们分开之前，我想跟你说一句话,”困住他们的那个人说。“我想，在你看到我出现在法庭上之前，我们可能不会再见面了。从现在到那时，我会给你一些东西让你好好想想。你现在知道我是什么了。我终于可以摊牌了。我是平克顿的伯蒂 · 爱德华兹。我被选中来瓦解你们的帮派。我有一个艰难而危险的游戏要玩。没有一个人，没有一个人，没有一个我最亲近的人，知道我在玩它。只有船长马文和我的雇主知道。但是今晚结束了，谢天谢地，我赢了!”

The seven pale, rigid faces looked up at him. There was unappeasable hatred in their eyes. He read the relentless threat.

七张苍白僵硬的面孔抬头看着他。他们的眼中充满了无法平息的仇恨。他读到了残酷的威胁。

“Maybe you think that the game is not over yet. Well, I take my chance of that. Anyhow, some of you will take no further hand, and there are sixty more besides yourselves that will see a jail this night. I'll tell you this, that when I was put upon this job I never believed there was such a society as yours. I thought it was paper talk, and that I would prove it so. They told me it was to do with the Freemen; so I went to Chicago and was made one. Then I was surer than ever that it was just paper talk; for I found no harm in the society, but a deal of good.

“也许你认为游戏还没有结束。好吧，我冒这个险。不管怎样，你们中的一些人将不再采取进一步的措施，今晚除了你们自己，还有六十多个人将面临牢狱之灾。我要告诉你的是，当我接受这份工作的时候，我从来不相信会有像你们这样的社会。我以为那只是纸上谈兵，我会证明给你看的。他们告诉我这是为了自由人，所以我去了芝加哥，成为了自由人。那时我比以往任何时候都确信，那只是纸上谈兵，因为我发现社会上没有什么坏处，只有许多好处。

“Still, I had to carry out my job, and I came to the coal valleys. When I reached this place I learned that I was wrong and that it wasn't a dime novel after all. So I stayed to look after it. I never killed a man in Chicago. I never minted a dollar in my life. Those I gave you were as good as any others; but I never spent money better. But I knew the way into your good wishes and so I pretended to you that the law was after me. It all worked just as I thought.

“尽管如此，我还是必须完成我的工作，我来到了煤谷。当我到达这个地方的时候，我意识到我错了，这毕竟不是一本廉价小说。所以我留下来照看它。我在芝加哥从没杀过人。我这辈子从来没有赚过一分钱。我给你的那些东西和别的东西一样好，但是我从来没有花过这么多钱。但是我知道如何实现你的美好愿望，所以我假装法律在追捕我。一切正如我所料。

“So I joined your infernal lodge, and I took my share in your councils. Maybe they will say that I was as bad as you. They can say what they like, so long as I get you. But what is the truth? The night I joined you beat up old man Stanger. I could not warn him, for there was no time; but I held your hand, Baldwin, when you would have killed him. If ever I have suggested things, so as to keep my place among you, they were things which I knew I could prevent. I could not save Dunn and Menzies, for I did not know enough; but I will see that their murderers are hanged. I gave Chester Wilcox warning, so that when I blew his house in he and his folk were in hiding. There was many a crime that I could not stop; but if you look back and think how often your man came home the other road, or was down in town when you went for him, or stayed indoors when you thought he would come out, you'll see my work.”

”于是我加入了你们的地狱之屋，在你们的会议上分了一杯羹。也许他们会说我和你一样坏。他们可以说他们喜欢什么，只要我得到你。但真相是什么呢？我加入你们的那天晚上，我揍了斯坦格老头。我不能警告他，因为没有时间了; 但是我握着你的手，鲍德温，当你想要杀了他的时候。如果我曾经提出一些建议，以便在你们中间保持我的位置，那么这些建议是我知道我可以避免的。我救不了邓恩和孟席斯，因为我知道的还不够多; 但是我会亲眼看着杀害他们的凶手被绞死。我警告了切斯特 · 威尔科克斯，所以当我在年炸毁他的房子时，他和他的家人都躲了起来。有很多罪行我都无法阻止，但是如果你回头想想，你的男人经常从另一条路回家，或者当你去找他的时候他在城里，或者当你认为他会出来的时候呆在家里，你就会看到我的工作。”

“You blasted traitor!” hissed McGinty through his closed teeth.

“你这个该死的叛徒!”麦金蒂咬紧牙关发出嘘声。

“Ay, John McGinty, you may call me that if it eases your smart. You and your like have been the enemy of God and man in these parts. It took a man to get between you and the poor devils of men and women that you held under your grip. There was just one way of doing it, and I did it. You call me a traitor; but I guess there's many a thousand will call me a deliverer that went down into hell to save them. I've had three months of it. I wouldn't have three such months again if they let me loose in the treasury at Washington for it. I had to stay till I had it all, every man and every secret right here in this hand. I'd have waited a little longer if it hadn't come to my knowledge that my secret was coming out. A letter had come into the town that would have set you wise to it all. Then I had to act and act quickly.

“啊，约翰 · 麦金蒂，如果这样能让你放聪明点，你可以这样叫我。在这些地方，你和你的同类一直是上帝和人类的敌人。只有一个男人才能挡在你和那些被你控制的可怜的男人和女人之间。只有一种方法，我做到了。你们说我是卖国贼，但我猜有许多人会说我是下地狱去救他们的拯救者。我已经忍了三个月了。如果他们让我为此在华盛顿的财政部呆上三个月，我就不会再有这样的时间了。我不得不留下来，直到我拥有了一切，每一个男人，每一个秘密，就在这只手里。如果我不知道我的秘密已经泄露出来，我会等得更久一点。城里来了一封信，足以使你明白这一切。然后我必须行动迅速。

“I've nothing more to say to you, except that when my time comes I'll die the easier when I think of the work I have done in this valley. Now, Marvin, I'll keep you no more. Take them in and get it over.”

”“我对你没有什么可说的了，除了当我的时间到了的时候，当我想到我在这个山谷里所做的工作时，我会死得更容易。现在，马文，我不再留你了。把他们带进来，然后解决问题。”

There is little more to tell. Scanlan had been given a sealed note to be left at the address of Miss Ettie Shafter, a mission which he had accepted with a wink and a knowing smile. In the early hours of the morning a beautiful woman and a much muffled man boarded a special train which had been sent by the railroad company, and made a swift, unbroken journey out of the land of danger. It was the last time that ever either Ettie or her lover set foot in the Valley of Fear. Ten days later they were married in Chicago, with old Jacob Shafter as witness of the wedding.

没什么好说的了。斯坎兰收到了一封密封的信，要把它留在埃蒂 · 沙夫特小姐的住处，他眨着眼睛，带着会意的微笑接受了这个任务。清晨，一个美丽的女人和一个闷声闷气的男人，登上了铁路公司派来的一列特别列车，从这片危险的土地上迅速而不间断地走了出来。这是埃蒂或她的情人最后一次踏入恐惧之谷。十天后，他们在芝加哥举行了婚礼，老雅各布 · 沙福特作为婚礼的见证人。

The trial of the Scowrers was held far from the place where their adherents might have terrified the guardians of the law. In vain they struggled. In vain the money of the lodge—money squeezed by blackmail out of the whole countryside—was spent like water in the attempt to save them. That cold, clear, unimpassioned statement from one who knew every detail of their lives, their organization, and their crimes was unshaken by all the wiles of their defenders. At last after so many years they were broken and scattered. The cloud was lifted forever from the valley.

斯考勒一家的审判是在远离他们的追随者可能会吓坏法律守护者的地方进行的。他们徒劳地挣扎着。在试图拯救他们的过程中，整个农村被敲诈勒索得到的旅馆的钱像水一样白白花掉了。这位了解他们生活、组织和罪行的每一个细节的人发表的冷酷、清晰、冷静的声明，没有被他们的辩护者的诡计所动摇。过了这么多年，它们终于破碎分散了。那朵云永远地从山谷中飘走了。

McGinty met his fate upon the scaffold, cringing and whining when the last hour came. Eight of his chief followers shared his fate. Fifty-odd had various degrees of imprisonment. The work of Birdy Edwards was complete.

麦金蒂在断头台上遭遇了他的命运，当最后一刻来临时，他畏缩不前，哀鸣不已。他的八个主要追随者也遭遇了同样的命运。五十多岁的人有不同程度的监禁。鸟人爱德华兹的工作完成了。

And yet, as he had guessed, the game was not over yet. There was another hand to be played, and yet another and another. Ted Baldwin, for one, had escaped the scaffold; so had the Willabys; so had several others of the fiercest spirits of the gang. For ten years they were out of the world, and then came a day when they were free once more—a day which Edwards, who knew his men, was very sure would be an end of his life of peace. They had sworn an oath on all that they thought holy to have his blood as a vengeance for their comrades. And well they strove to keep their vow!

然而，正如他所猜测的那样，游戏还没有结束。还有一手要玩，一手又一手。例如，Ted Baldwin 逃出了绞刑台，Willabys 也逃出了绞刑台，还有其他几个帮派中最凶猛的鬼魂。他们离开这个世界十年了，然后有一天他们又重获自由了——爱德华兹认识他的部下，他非常肯定这一天将是他和平生活的结束。他们已经对所有他们认为神圣的东西发誓，为了报复他们的同志，他们流了他的血。他们努力遵守他们的誓言！

From Chicago he was chased, after two attempts so near success that it was sure that the third would get him. From Chicago he went under a changed name to California, and it was there that the light went for a time out of his life when Ettie Edwards died. Once again he was nearly killed, and once again under the name of Douglas he worked in a lonely canyon, where with an English partner named Barker he amassed a fortune. At last there came a warning to him that the bloodhounds were on his track once more, and he cleared—only just in time—for England. And thence came the John Douglas who for a second time married a worthy mate, and lived for five years as a Sussex county gentleman, a life which ended with the strange happenings of which we have heard.

他在芝加哥被人追赶，两次尝试都非常接近成功，以至于第三次肯定能抓住他。从芝加哥，他改名为加利福尼亚，当爱蒂 · 爱德华兹去世的时候，他的生命中就在那里消失了一段时间。他再一次险些丧命，再一次以道格拉斯的名义在一个偏僻的峡谷里工作，在那里他和一个名叫巴克的英国伙伴聚敛了一大笔财富。最后，他收到了警告，警犬再次追上了他的足迹，他及时赶到了英格兰。于是，约翰 · 道格拉斯第二次嫁给了一个配得上他的人，在苏塞克斯郡过了五年的绅士生活，这种生活在我们听说过的那些奇怪的事情中结束了。
