When McMurdo awoke next morning he had good reason to remember his initiation into the lodge. His head ached with the effect of the drink, and his arm, where he had been branded, was hot and swollen. Having his own peculiar source of income, he was irregular in his attendance at his work; so he had a late breakfast, and remained at home for the morning writing a long letter to a friend. Afterwards he read the Daily Herald. In a special column put in at the last moment he read:

第二天早上麦克默多醒来的时候，他有充分的理由记起他入会的那一刻。他的头因饮料的作用而疼痛，他被烙印的手臂又热又肿。他有自己独特的收入来源，不定期地上班，所以早饭吃得很晚，整个上午都呆在家里给朋友写一封长信。后来他读了《每日先驱报》。在最后一刻，他在一篇专栏文章中写道:

Outrage at the herald office — Editor seriously injured

《先驱报》编辑严重受伤

It was a short account of the facts with which he was himself more familiar than the writer could have been. It ended with the statement:

这是一篇对事实的简短叙述，他自己比作者更熟悉这些事实。最后的声明是:

The matter is now in the hands of the police; but it can hardly be hoped that their exertions will be attended by any better results than in the past. Some of the men were recognized, and there is hope that a conviction may be obtained. The source of the outrage was, it need hardly be said, that infamous society which has held this community in bondage for so long a period, and against which the Herald has taken so uncompromising a stand. Mr. Stanger's many friends will rejoice to hear that, though he has been cruelly and brutally beaten, and though he has sustained severe injuries about the head, there is no immediate danger to his life.

这件事现在在警察的手中，但是很难指望他们的努力会有比过去更好的结果。有些人被认出来了，有希望可以被定罪。这种愤怒的根源，无需多言，就是那个声名狼藉的社会，长期以来，这个社会一直把这个群体束缚在自己的手中，而《先驱报》对此采取了毫不妥协的立场。斯坦格先生的许多朋友听到这个消息一定会很高兴，尽管他遭受了残酷和残忍的殴打，尽管他的头部受了重伤，但他的生命没有立即受到威胁。

Below it stated that a guard of police, armed with Winchester rifles, had been requisitioned for the defense of the office.

文件下面写道，为了保卫办公室，一名配备温彻斯特步枪的警卫被征用。

McMurdo had laid down the paper, and was lighting his pipe with a hand which was shaky from the excesses of the previous evening, when there was a knock outside, and his landlady brought to him a note which had just been handed in by a lad. It was unsigned, and ran thus:

麦克默多放下报纸，点着烟斗的手因为前一天晚上玩得过火而发抖，这时外面传来一阵敲门声，他的女房东给了他一张纸条，那是一个小伙子刚刚递给他的。信上没有署名，就这样写着:

I should wish to speak to you, but would rather not do so in your house. You will find me beside the flagstaff upon Miller Hill. If you will come there now, I have something which it is important for you to hear and for me to say.

我想和你谈谈，但不想在你家里谈。你会在米勒山上的旗杆旁找到我。如果你现在过来，我有些重要的事情要告诉你，也要告诉你。

McMurdo read the note twice with the utmost surprise; for he could not imagine what it meant or who was the author of it. Had it been in a feminine hand, he might have imagined that it was the beginning of one of those adventures which had been familiar enough in his past life. But it was the writing of a man, and of a well educated one, too. Finally, after some hesitation, he determined to see the matter through.

麦克默多站带着极大的惊讶读了两遍这封信，因为他无法想象这是什么意思，也不知道这封信是谁写的。如果它在一个女人的手里，他可能会想象这是一个冒险的开始，这种冒险在他过去的生活中已经很熟悉了。但这是一个人的作品，也是一个受过良好教育的人的作品。最后，他犹豫了一会儿，决定把这件事办完。

Miller Hill is an ill-kept public park in the very centre of the town. In summer it is a favourite resort of the people; but in winter it is desolate enough. From the top of it one has a view not only of the whole straggling, grimy town, but of the winding valley beneath, with its scattered mines and factories blackening the snow on each side of it, and of the wooded and white-capped ranges flanking it.

米勒山是市中心一个管理不善的公共公园。夏天它是人们最喜爱的旅游胜地，但是冬天它却十分荒凉。从山顶望去，不仅可以看到整个凌乱、肮脏的城镇，还可以看到山谷下面蜿蜒的山谷，山谷两边散布着矿井和工厂，雪被山谷两侧的积雪染成了黑色，山谷两侧林木繁茂、山峦覆盖着白雪。

McMurdo strolled up the winding path hedged in with evergreens until he reached the deserted restaurant which forms the centre of summer gaiety. Beside it was a bare flagstaff, and underneath it a man, his hat drawn down and the collar of his overcoat turned up. When he turned his face McMurdo saw that it was Brother Morris, he who had incurred the anger of the Bodymaster the night before. The lodge sign was given and exchanged as they met.

麦克默多站沿着蜿蜒曲折的小路漫步，小路两边绿意盎然，他来到了一家空无一人的餐馆，这家餐馆是夏日欢乐的中心。旁边是一根光秃秃的旗杆，旗杆下面是一个人，他的帽子拉下来，大衣领子竖起来。当他转过脸来时，麦克默多站看到是莫里斯兄弟，他在前一天晚上惹恼了“身体大师”。当他们见面时，分会的标志被交换了。

“I wanted to have a word with you, Mr. McMurdo,” said the older man, speaking with a hesitation which showed that he was on delicate ground. “It was kind of you to come.”

“我想和你谈谈，麦克默多先生,”老人犹豫地说，这表明他的立场很微妙。“你能来真是太好了。”

“Why did you not put your name to the note?”

“你为什么不把你的名字写在便条上?”

“One has to be cautious, mister. One never knows in times like these how a thing may come back to one. One never knows either who to trust or who not to trust.”

“先生，你必须小心。在这样的时刻，谁也不知道一件事怎么会回到从前。谁也不知道该相信谁，不该相信谁。”

“Surely one may trust brothers of the lodge.”

“当然可以相信会所的兄弟们。”

“No, no, not always,” cried Morris with vehemence. “Whatever we say, even what we think, seems to go back to that man McGinty.”

“不，不，不总是这样,”莫里斯激动地喊道。“无论我们说什么，甚至我们的想法，似乎都回到了那个麦金蒂身上。”

“Look here!” said McMurdo sternly. “It was only last night, as you know well, that I swore good faith to our Bodymaster. Would you be asking me to break my oath?”

“看这儿!”麦克默多站严肃地说。“就在昨天晚上，正如你们所知道的，我向我们的身体主人发了誓。难道你要我违背誓言吗?”

“If that is the view you take,” said Morris sadly, “I can only say that I am sorry I gave you the trouble to come and meet me. Things have come to a bad pass when two free citizens cannot speak their thoughts to each other.”

“如果你是这么想的,”莫里斯伤心地说，“我只能说，我很抱歉给你这么大的麻烦来见我。如果两个自由的公民不能互相表达自己的想法，事情就会变得很糟糕。”

McMurdo, who had been watching his companion very narrowly, relaxed somewhat in his bearing. “Sure I spoke for myself only,” said he. “I am a newcomer, as you know, and I am strange to it all. It is not for me to open my mouth, Mr. Morris, and if you think well to say anything to me I am here to hear it.”

麦克默多站一直非常仔细地看着他的同伴，举止有些放松。“当然，我只是为自己说话,”他说。“你知道，我是新来的，我对这一切都很陌生。莫里斯先生，我不该开口说话，如果你觉得对我说点什么好的话，我就在这里听你说。”

“And to take it back to Boss McGinty!” said Morris bitterly.

“把它还给麦金蒂老板!”莫里斯苦涩地说。

“Indeed, then, you do me injustice there,” cried McMurdo. “For myself I am loyal to the lodge, and so I tell you straight; but I would be a poor creature if I were to repeat to any other what you might say to me in confidence. It will go no further than me; though I warn you that you may get neither help nor sympathy.”

“的确，那么，你在那里对我是不公平的,”麦克默多喊道。”“对我自己来说，我是忠实于这个小屋的，所以我直截了当地告诉你，但是如果我把你可能私下里对我说的话再告诉别人的话，我就成了一个可怜的人了。不过我警告你，你不会得到帮助，也不会得到同情。”

“I have given up looking for either the one or the other,” said Morris. “I may be putting my very life in your hands by what I say; but, bad as you are—and it seemed to me last night that you were shaping to be as bad as the worst—still you are new to it, and your conscience cannot yet be as hardened as theirs. That was why I thought to speak with you.”

莫里斯说: “我已经放弃了寻找这两者中的任何一个。”。”我说的话可能把我的生命交到你手里; 但是，你虽然很坏，而且昨晚我觉得你已经变得和最坏的人一样坏了，但是你还是新手，你的良心还不能像他们那样强硬。所以我才想到要跟你谈谈。”

“Well, what have you to say?”

“那么，你有什么要说的吗?”

“If you give me away, may a curse be on you!”

“你若把我交给别人，愿咒诅临到你身上!”

“Sure, I said I would not.”

“当然，我说过我不会。”

“I would ask you, then, when you joined the Freeman's society in Chicago and swore vows of charity and fidelity, did ever it cross your mind that you might find it would lead you to crime?”

“那么，我想问问你，当你在芝加哥加入弗里曼协会，发誓施舍和忠诚时，你有没有想过这会导致你犯罪?”

“If you call it crime,” McMurdo answered.

“如果你说这是犯罪的话,”麦克默多回答说。

“Call it crime!” cried Morris, his voice vibrating with passion. “You have seen little of it if you can call it anything else. Was it crime last night when a man old enough to be your father was beaten till the blood dripped from his white hairs? Was that crime—or what else would you call it?”

“这是犯罪!”莫里斯喊道，他的声音因激情而颤抖。“如果你可以称之为别的东西的话，你几乎看不到它。昨天晚上，一个老得可以当你父亲的人被打到血从他的白头发上滴下来，这是犯罪吗？这是犯罪吗? 或者你还能怎么称呼它呢?”

“There are some would say it was war,” said McMurdo, “a war of two classes with all in, so that each struck as best it could.”

“有些人会说这是一场战争,”麦克默多站表示，“一场两个阶级的全面战争，所以每个阶级都尽可能地发动攻击。”

“Well, did you think of such a thing when you joined the Freeman's society at Chicago?”

“那么，当你在芝加哥加入弗里曼协会时，你有没有想过这样的事情?”

“No, I'm bound to say I did not.”

“不，我必须说我没有。”

“Nor did I when I joined it at Philadelphia. It was just a benefit club and a meeting place for one's fellows. Then I heard of this place—curse the hour that the name first fell upon my ears!—and I came to better myself! My God! to better myself! My wife and three children came with me. I started a dry goods store on Market Square, and I prospered well. The word had gone round that I was a Freeman, and I was forced to join the local lodge, same as you did last night. I've the badge of shame on my forearm and something worse branded on my heart. I found that I was under the orders of a black villain and caught in a meshwork of crime. What could I do? Every word I said to make things better was taken as treason, same as it was last night. I can't get away; for all I have in the world is in my store. If I leave the society, I know well that it means murder to me, and God knows what to my wife and children. Oh, man, it is awful—awful!” He put his hands to his face, and his body shook with convulsive sobs.

“当我在费城加入它时，我也不知道。那只是一个慈善俱乐部，也是同伴们聚会的地方。这时我听说了这个地方ーー真该诅咒这个名字第一次出现在我的耳朵里的时间！我的天啊！让自己变得更好！我的妻子和三个孩子和我一起来的。我在市场广场开了一家干货店，生意兴隆。我是自由人的消息已经传开了，我被迫加入了当地的旅馆，就像你昨晚所做的一样。我的前臂上有耻辱的徽章，心上还有更糟糕的烙印。我发现自己是在一个黑人恶棍的命令下，被卷入了一场犯罪网络。我能做什么？我为了使事情好转而说的每一句话都被认为是叛国，就像昨晚一样。我走不开，因为我在这个世界上所有的东西都在我的店里。如果我离开这个社会，我知道这对我意味着谋杀，上帝知道对我的妻子和孩子意味着什么。哦，伙计，太可怕了——太可怕了!”他把手放在脸上，全身抽搐着抽泣起来。

McMurdo shrugged his shoulders. “You were too soft for the job,” said he. “You are the wrong sort for such work.”

麦克默多耸了耸肩。“你太软弱了，不能胜任这份工作,”他说。“你不适合做这种工作。”

“I had a conscience and a religion; but they made me a criminal among them. I was chosen for a job. If I backed down I knew well what would come to me. Maybe I'm a coward. Maybe it's the thought of my poor little woman and the children that makes me one. Anyhow I went. I guess it will haunt me forever.

我有良心、有信仰、但他们使我在他们中间作了罪人。我被选中做一份工作。如果我让步，我很清楚会发生什么。也许我是个懦夫。也许是因为想到我可怜的小女人和孩子们，我才成为了一个人。不管怎样，我去了。我想这会永远困扰着我。

“It was a lonely house, twenty miles from here, over the range yonder. I was told off for the door, same as you were last night. They could not trust me with the job. The others went in. When they came out their hands were crimson to the wrists. As we turned away a child was screaming out of the house behind us. It was a boy of five who had seen his father murdered. I nearly fainted with the horror of it, and yet I had to keep a bold and smiling face; for well I knew that if I did not it would be out of my house that they would come next with their bloody hands and it would be my little Fred that would be screaming for his father.

“那是一座孤零零的房子，离这儿有二十英里远，在远处。我像你昨天晚上一样被责备到门口去。他们不相信我能胜任这项工作。其他人都进去了。当他们出来的时候，他们的手腕都是深红色的。当我们转身离开的时候，一个孩子在我们身后的房子外面尖叫。那是一个五岁的男孩，他亲眼目睹父亲被谋杀。因为我知道，如果我不这样做，他们就会从我的房子里走出来，用他们血淋淋的双手走过来，而我的小弗雷德就会尖叫着喊他的父亲。

“But I was a criminal then, part sharer in a murder, lost forever in this world, and lost also in the next. I am a good Catholic; but the priest would have no word with me when he heard I was a Scowrer, and I am excommunicated from my faith. That's how it stands with me. And I see you going down the same road, and I ask you what the end is to be. Are you ready to be a cold-blooded murderer also, or can we do anything to stop it?”

“但是那时我是一个罪犯，在一场谋杀案中有一部分是分享的，在这个世界上永远消失了，在另一个世界里也是。我是一个虔诚的天主教徒，但是当牧师听说我是记者的时候，他是不会和我说话的，我被逐出了我的信仰。我就是这么想的。我看到你走上同样的道路，我问你结局会是什么。你也准备好成为一个冷血杀手了吗? 或者我们可以做些什么来阻止它?”

“What would you do?” asked McMurdo abruptly. “You would not inform?”

“你会怎么做?”麦克默多突然问道。“你不会通知吗?”

“God forbid!” cried Morris. “Sure, the very thought would cost me my life.”

“上帝保佑!”莫里斯叫道，“当然，这个想法会让我付出生命的代价。”

“That's well,” said McMurdo. “I'm thinking that you are a weak man and that you make too much of the matter.”

“这很好,”麦克默多站表示。“我认为你是一个软弱的人，你把这件事看得太重了。”

“Too much! Wait till you have lived here longer. Look down the valley! See the cloud of a hundred chimneys that overshadows it! I tell you that the cloud of murder hangs thicker and lower than that over the heads of the people. It is the Valley of Fear, the Valley of Death. The terror is in the hearts of the people from the dusk to the dawn. Wait, young man, and you will learn for yourself.”

“太多了！等你在这儿住久一点再说吧。看下面的山谷！看那一百个烟囱形成的云朵遮住了它！我告诉你们，谋杀的阴云比笼罩在人民头上的阴云更浓更低。这是恐惧之谷，死亡之谷。从黄昏到黎明，恐惧一直存在于人们的心中。等着瞧吧，年轻人，你会自学成才的。”

“Well, I'll let you know what I think when I have seen more,” said McMurdo carelessly. “What is very clear is that you are not the man for the place, and that the sooner you sell out—if you only get a dime a dollar for what the business is worth—the better it will be for you. What you have said is safe with me; but, by Gar! if I thought you were an informer—”

麦克默多站漫不经心地说: “好吧，等我看到更多的东西，我会告诉你我的想法。”。“非常清楚的是，你不是这个地方的合适人选，而且你越早出售(如果你的业务价值只能得到一毛钱) ，对你来说就越好。你们所说的在我这里是安全的，只是在加耳那里！如果我认为你是个告密者——”

“No, no!” cried Morris piteously.

“不，不!”莫里斯可怜地叫道。

“Well, let it rest at that. I'll bear what you have said in mind, and maybe some day I'll come back to it. I expect you meant kindly by speaking to me like this. Now I'll be getting home.”

”“好吧，就这样吧。我会记住你所说的话，也许有一天我会回过头来再说。我希望你这样跟我说话是出于好意。现在我要回家了。”

“One word before you go,” said Morris. “We may have been seen together. They may want to know what we have spoken about.”

“你走之前说一句话,”莫里斯说。“有人可能看到我们在一起。他们可能想知道我们都谈了些什么。”

“Ah! that's well thought of.”

“啊! 想得真周到。”

“I offer you a clerkship in my store.”

“我想请你到我的店里当店员。”

“And I refuse it. That's our business. Well, so long, Brother Morris, and may you find things go better with you in the future.”

”“我拒绝。那是我们的事。好吧，再见，莫里斯兄弟，祝你将来一切顺利。”

That same afternoon, as McMurdo sat smoking, lost in thought beside the stove of his sitting-room, the door swung open and its framework was filled with the huge figure of Boss McGinty. He passed the sign, and then seating himself opposite to the young man he looked at him steadily for some time, a look which was as steadily returned.

当天下午，麦克默多站坐在起居室的火炉旁抽烟，陷入沉思，门打开了，里面坐满了巨大的麦金蒂老板。他经过那块牌子，然后坐在那个年轻人的对面，稳定地看了他一会儿，他的目光又稳定地回到那个年轻人身上。

“I'm not much of a visitor, Brother McMurdo,” he said at last. “I guess I am too busy over the folk that visit me. But I thought I'd stretch a point and drop down to see you in your own house.”

“麦克默多兄弟，我不是一个常来拜访的人,”他最后说。“我想我太忙于应付那些来访的人了。但是我想我应该伸展一下身子，在你自己的房子里看看你。”

“I'm proud to see you here, Councillor,” McMurdo answered heartily, bringing his whisky bottle out of the cupboard. “It's an honour that I had not expected.”

“我很高兴在这里见到你，议员,”麦克默多从橱柜里拿出他的威士忌酒瓶，热情地回答。“这是我始料未及的荣幸。”

“How's the arm?” asked the Boss.

“胳膊怎么样了?”老板问。

McMurdo made a wry face. “Well, I'm not forgetting it,” he said; “but it's worth it.”

麦克默多做了个鬼脸。“好吧，我不会忘记的,”他说，“但这是值得的。”

“Yes, it's worth it,” the other answered, “to those that are loyal and go through with it and are a help to the lodge. What were you speaking to Brother Morris about on Miller Hill this morning?”

“是的，这是值得的,”另一个回答说，“对于那些忠心耿耿，坚持到底，帮助那个小屋的人来说。你今天早上在米勒山跟莫里斯说了什么?”

The question came so suddenly that it was well that he had his answer prepared. He burst into a hearty laugh. “Morris didn't know I could earn a living here at home. He shan't know either; for he has got too much conscience for the likes of me. But he's a good-hearted old chap. It was his idea that I was at a loose end, and that he would do me a good turn by offering me a clerkship in a dry goods store.”

问题来得如此突然，以至于他准备好了答案。他放声大笑。“莫里斯不知道我可以在家里谋生。他也不会知道，因为对我这样的人来说，他太有良心了。但他是个好心肠的老家伙。他认为我没什么事可做，所以他愿意帮我在一家干货店当店员。”

“Oh, that was it?”

“哦，就这样吗?”

“Yes, that was it.”

“是的，就是这样。”

“And you refused it?”

“你拒绝了?”

“Sure. Couldn't I earn ten times as much in my own bedroom with four hours' work?”

“当然可以。我在自己的卧室里干四个小时的活，能挣到十倍的钱吗?”

“That's so. But I wouldn't get about too much with Morris.”

“是的，但是我不会和莫里斯有太多的交往。”

“Why not?”

“为什么不呢?”

“Well, I guess because I tell you not. That's enough for most folk in these parts.”

“嗯，我想是因为我没有告诉你。对于这个地区的大多数人来说，这已经足够了。”

“It may be enough for most folk; but it ain't enough for me, Councillor,” said McMurdo boldly. “If you are a judge of men, you'll know that.”

“这对大多数人来说可能够了，但对我来说还不够，议员先生,”麦克默多站大胆地说。“如果你是一个男人的法官，你就会知道这一点。”

The swarthy giant glared at him, and his hairy paw closed for an instant round the glass as though he would hurl it at the head of his companion. Then he laughed in his loud, boisterous, insincere fashion.

黑黝黝的巨人瞪着他，他毛茸茸的爪子在玻璃杯周围合上了一会儿，仿佛要把它扔到他同伴的头上。然后，他以他那种喧闹、喧闹、虚伪的方式大笑起来。

“You're a queer card, for sure,” said he. “Well, if you want reasons, I'll give them. Did Morris say nothing to you against the lodge?”

“你真是一张古怪的牌，真的,”他说。”“好吧，如果你想要理由，我可以给你。莫里斯没有对你提起过反对小屋的事吗?”

“No.”

“没有。”

“Nor against me?”

“也不反对我?”

“No.”

“没有。”

“Well, that's because he daren't trust you. But in his heart he is not a loyal brother. We know that well. So we watch him and we wait for the time to admonish him. I'm thinking that the time is drawing near. There's no room for scabby sheep in our pen. But if you keep company with a disloyal man, we might think that you were disloyal, too. See?”

”“嗯，那是因为他不敢相信你。但在他的内心深处，他并不是一个忠诚的兄弟。我们很清楚这点。所以我们观察他，等待时机劝戒他。我想时间快到了。我们的羊圈里没有地方容纳结痂的羊。但是如果你和一个不忠诚的人交往，我们可能会认为你也不忠诚。看到了吗?”

“There's no chance of my keeping company with him; for I dislike the man,” McMurdo answered. “As to being disloyal, if it was any man but you he would not use the word to me twice.”

“我不可能和他交往，因为我不喜欢这个人,”麦克默多回答说。“至于不忠，如果是别人，除了你，他不会对我说第二次。”

“Well, that's enough,” said McGinty, draining off his glass. “I came down to give you a word in season, and you've had it.”

“好了，够了,”麦金蒂一边说，一边把杯子一饮而尽。“我下来是为了在适当的时候给你一句话，你已经受够了。”

“I'd like to know,” said McMurdo, “how you ever came to learn that I had spoken with Morris at all?”

“我想知道,”麦克默多站说，“你是怎么知道我和莫里斯谈过话的?”

McGinty laughed. “It's my business to know what goes on in this township,” said he. “I guess you'd best reckon on my hearing all that passes. Well, time's up, and I'll just say—”

麦金蒂笑了。他说: “我的工作就是了解这个小镇的情况。”。“我想你最好指望我的耳朵听得见。好了，时间到了，我只想说 --”

But his leavetaking was cut short in a very unexpected fashion. With a sudden crash the door flew open, and three frowning, intent faces glared in at them from under the peaks of police caps. McMurdo sprang to his feet and half drew his revolver; but his arm stopped midway as he became conscious that two Winchester rifles were levelled at his head. A man in uniform advanced into the room, a six-shooter in his hand. It was Captain Marvin, once of Chicago, and now of the Mine Constabulary. He shook his head with a half-smile at McMurdo.

但是他的休假以一种意想不到的方式被缩短了。随着一声突然的撞击，门猛地打开了，三个人皱着眉头，目不转睛地从警帽的尖顶下瞪着他们。麦克默多站跳了起来，半抽出左轮手枪，但他的胳膊停在了中途，因为他意识到有两把温彻斯特步枪瞄准了他的头。一个穿制服的男人走进房间，手里拿着一把六发左轮手枪。这是马文队长，他曾经是芝加哥警察，现在是矿警。他对着麦克默多站摇了摇头，露出一丝微笑。

“I thought you'd be getting into trouble, Mr. Crooked McMurdo of Chicago,” said he. “Can't keep out of it, can you? Take your hat and come along with us.”

“我以为你会遇到麻烦，芝加哥的克鲁克德 · 麦克默多先生,”他说。”“你不能置身事外，是吗？带上你的帽子，跟我们一起走吧。”

“I guess you'll pay for this, Captain Marvin,” said McGinty. “Who are you, I'd like to know, to break into a house in this fashion and molest honest, law-abiding men?”

“我想你会为此付出代价的，马文船长,”麦金蒂说。“我想知道，你们是谁，竟然这样闯进一所房子，猥亵诚实守法的人?”

“You're standing out in this deal, Councillor McGinty,” said the police captain. “We are not out after you, but after this man McMurdo. It is for you to help, not to hinder us in our duty,”

“麦金蒂议员，在这笔交易中，你显得很突出,”警察队长说。“我们不是在追捕你们，而是在追捕这个麦克默多站。我们的责任在于你们的帮助，而不是阻碍

“He is a friend of mine, and I'll answer for his conduct,” said the Boss.

“他是我的朋友，我要为他的行为负责,”老板说。

“By all accounts, Mr. McGinty, you may have to answer for your own conduct some of these days,” the captain answered. “This man McMurdo was a crook before ever he came here, and he's a crook still. Cover him, Patrolman, while I disarm him.”

“据说，麦金蒂先生，有时候你得为自己的行为负责,”船长回答说。“这个麦克默多在来这里之前是个骗子，他现在还是个骗子。掩护他，巡警，我来缴他的械。”

“There's my pistol,” said McMurdo coolly. “Maybe, Captain Marvin, if you and I were alone and face to face you would not take me so easily.”

“这是我的手枪,”麦克默多冷冷地说。“也许，马文船长，如果你和我单独面对面，你就不会这么轻易地带走我了。”

“Where's your warrant?” asked McGinty. “By Gar! a man might as well live in Russia as in Vermissa while folk like you are running the police. It's a capitalist outrage, and you'll hear more of it, I reckon.”

“你们的搜查令呢?”麦金蒂问道。“以加尔之名！像你这样的人在管理警察的时候，一个人不如生活在 Vermissa。这是资本主义的暴行，我想你还会听到更多这样的话。”

“You do what you think is your duty the best way you can, Councillor. We'll look after ours.”

“议员先生，你尽你的职责吧，我们会照顾好我们的。”

“What am I accused of?” asked McMurdo.

“我被指控了什么?”麦克默多问道。

“Of being concerned in the beating of old Editor Stanger at the Herald office. It wasn't your fault that it isn't a murder charge.”

”担心老编辑斯坦格在《先驱报》办公室遭到殴打。这不是谋杀指控，不是你的错。”

“Well, if that's all you have against him,” cried McGinty with a laugh, “you can save yourself a deal of trouble by dropping it right now. This man was with me in my saloon playing poker up to midnight, and I can bring a dozen to prove it.”

“好吧，如果这就是你对他的全部敌意,”麦金蒂笑着说，“你现在就把它扔掉，可以省去一大堆麻烦。这个人和我一起在沙龙里玩扑克玩到半夜，我可以带一打来证明。”

“That's your affair, and I guess you can settle it in court to-morrow. Meanwhile, come on, McMurdo, and come quietly if you don't want a gun across your head. You stand wide, Mr. McGinty; for I warn you I will stand no resistance when I am on duty!”

”“那是你的事，我想你可以明天在法庭上解决。与此同时，来吧，麦克默多站，如果你不想被枪顶着脑袋，就乖乖地来吧。你给我站远点，麦金蒂先生，因为我警告你，我上班的时候不会有任何抵抗!”

So determined was the appearance of the captain that both McMurdo and his boss were forced to accept the situation. The latter managed to have a few whispered words with the prisoner before they parted.

船长的外表是如此的坚决，以至于麦克默多和他的老板都被迫接受这个情况。后者设法在他们分开之前和囚犯低声说了几句话。

“What about—” he jerked his thumb upward to signify the coining plant.

“怎么样ーー”他把大拇指向上一竖，象征着印花的植物。

“All right,” whispered McMurdo, who had devised a safe hiding place under the floor.

“好吧,”麦克默多小声说，他已经在地板下设计了一个安全的藏身之处。

“I'll bid you good-bye,” said the Boss, shaking hands. “I'll see Reilly the lawyer and take the defense upon myself. Take my word for it that they won't be able to hold you.”

“我跟你说再见,”老板握着手说。“我要见见律师莱利，自己辩护。相信我的话，他们抓不住你的。”

“I wouldn't bet on that. Guard the prisoner, you two, and shoot him if he tries any games. I'll search the house before I leave.”

“我不敢打赌。你们两个守住犯人，如果他耍花招，就开枪打死他。我走之前要搜查一下房子。”

He did so; but apparently found no trace of the concealed plant. When he had descended he and his men escorted McMurdo to headquarters. Darkness had fallen, and a keen blizzard was blowing so that the streets were nearly deserted; but a few loiterers followed the group, and emboldened by invisibility shouted imprecations at the prisoner.

他这样做了，但显然没有发现隐藏的植物的踪迹。当他下来后，他和他的人护送麦克默多到总部。夜幕已经降临，一场狂风大作，街上几乎空无一人; 但是有几个闲逛的人跟在他们后面，看不见的人大声咒骂囚犯，使他们胆子大了起来。

“Lynch the cursed Scowrer!” they cried. “Lynch him!” They laughed and jeered as he was pushed into the police station. After a short, formal examination from the inspector in charge he was put into the common cell. Here he found Baldwin and three other criminals of the night before, all arrested that afternoon and waiting their trial next morning.

“处死这个该死的记分员!”他们哭了。“处死他!”当他被推进警察局时，他们又是笑又是嘲笑。经过主管检查员的简短正式检查后，他被关进了普通牢房。他在这里发现了鲍德温和前一天晚上的其他三名罪犯，他们都在当天下午被捕，第二天早上等待审判。

But even within this inner fortress of the law the long arm of the Freemen was able to extend. Late at night there came a jailer with a straw bundle for their bedding, out of which he extracted two bottles of whisky, some glasses, and a pack of cards. They spent a hilarious night, without an anxious thought as to the ordeal of the morning.

但即使在这个法律的内部堡垒，自由人的长臂也能够伸展。深夜，来了一个狱卒，手里拿着一个稻草包，里面装着他们的寝具，他从里面抽出两瓶威士忌，一些玻璃杯和一副纸牌。他们度过了一个欢乐的夜晚，对早晨的折磨没有任何焦虑的想法。

Nor had they cause, as the result was to show. The magistrate could not possibly, on the evidence, have held them for a higher court. On the one hand the compositors and pressmen were forced to admit that the light was uncertain, that they were themselves much perturbed, and that it was difficult for them to swear to the identity of the assailants; although they believed that the accused were among them. Cross examined by the clever attorney who had been engaged by McGinty, they were even more nebulous in their evidence.

结果表明，他们也没有起因。根据证据，治安法官不可能把他们送上更高一级的法庭。一方面，排字工人和印刷工人被迫承认灯光不明，他们自己也感到很不安，他们很难对攻击者的身份发誓; 尽管他们认为被告也在其中。被麦金蒂聘请的聪明律师盘问后，他们的证词更加模糊不清。

The injured man had already deposed that he was so taken by surprise by the suddenness of the attack that he could state nothing beyond the fact that the first man who struck him wore a moustache. He added that he knew them to be Scowrers, since no one else in the community could possibly have any enmity to him, and he had long been threatened on account of his outspoken editorials. On the other hand, it was clearly shown by the united and unfaltering evidence of six citizens, including that high municipal official, Councillor McGinty, that the men had been at a card party at the Union House until an hour very much later than the commission of the outrage.

那个受伤的人已经宣誓作证，他对突然袭击感到非常惊讶，除了第一个打他的人留了胡子以外，他什么也说不出来。他补充说，他知道他们都是冷嘲热讽的人，因为社区里没有其他人可能对他有任何敌意，而且他长期以来一直因为他直言不讳的社论而受到威胁。另一方面，包括市政府高级官员麦金蒂议员在内的六位市民团结一致、坚定不移的证据清楚地表明，这些人在联合大厦参加一个纸牌聚会，直到暴行发生的一个小时之后。

Needless to say that they were discharged with something very near to an apology from the bench for the inconvenience to which they had been put, together with an implied censure of Captain Marvin and the police for their officious zeal.

不用说，他们被开除的原因几乎就是法官席上对他们所受到的不便表示歉意，还有马文上尉和警察对他们过分热情的含蓄谴责。

The verdict was greeted with loud applause by a court in which McMurdo saw many familiar faces. Brothers of the lodge smiled and waved. But there were others who sat with compressed lips and brooding eyes as the men filed out of the dock. One of them, a little, dark-bearded, resolute fellow, put the thoughts of himself and comrades into words as the ex-prisoners passed him.

法庭对这一判决报以热烈的掌声，在这里，麦克默多站看到了许多熟悉的面孔。小屋的兄弟们微笑着挥手。但是当他们鱼贯走出被告席的时候，还有一些人紧闭着嘴，眼神忧郁。其中一个是个小个子，留着黑胡子，意志坚定的家伙，当被释放的囚犯从他身边经过时，他把自己和同志们的想法表达了出来。

“You damned murderers!” he said. “We'll fix you yet!”

“你们这些该死的杀人犯!”他说。“我们会治好你们的!”
