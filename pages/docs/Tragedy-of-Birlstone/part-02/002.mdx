}

McMurdo was a man who made his mark quickly. Wherever he was the folk around soon knew it. Within a week he had become infinitely the most important person at Shafter's. There were ten or a dozen boarders there; but they were honest foremen or commonplace clerks from the stores, of a very different calibre from the young Irishman. Of an evening when they gathered together his joke was always the readiest, his conversation the brightest, and his song the best. He was a born boon companion, with a magnetism which drew good humour from all around him.

麦克默多是一个迅速成名的人。不管他在哪里，周围的人很快就知道了这一点。不到一个星期，他就成了沙夫特最重要的人物。那里有十几个寄宿生，但他们都是诚实的工头，或是商店里的普通职员，与年轻的爱尔兰人的身份大不相同。他们聚在一起的一个晚上，他总是开最大的玩笑，他的谈话最精彩，他的歌最动听。他是个天生的好伙伴，他的魅力吸引了他周围所有人的好脾气。

And yet he showed again and again, as he had shown in the railway carriage, a capacity for sudden, fierce anger, which compelled the respect and even the fear of those who met him. For the law, too, and all who were connected with it, he exhibited a bitter contempt which delighted some and alarmed others of his fellow boarders.

然而，他一次又一次地表现出，就像他在铁路客车中表现出的那样，一种突如其来的、强烈的愤怒的能力，迫使那些遇见他的人尊敬甚至害怕他。因为法律，以及所有与法律有关的人，他表现出一种强烈的蔑视，这使一些人感到高兴，也使另一些寄宿者感到惊恐。

From the first he made it evident, by his open admiration, that the daughter of the house had won his heart from the instant that he had set eyes upon her beauty and her grace. He was no backward suitor. On the second day he told her that he loved her, and from then onward he repeated the same story with an absolute disregard of what she might say to discourage him.

从一开始，他就明显地表示出，从他一眼看到她的美丽和优雅的那一刻起，这个家庭的女儿就赢得了他的心。他不是落后的求婚者。第二天，他告诉她，他爱她，从那以后，他又重复了同样的故事，完全不顾她可能说什么使他泄气。

“Someone else?” he would cry. “Well, the worse luck for someone else! Let him look out for himself! Am I to lose my life's chance and all my heart's desire for someone else? You can keep on saying no, Ettie: the day will come when you will say yes, and I'm young enough to wait.”

“还有别人吗?”他会哭。”“那么，别人的运气就更差了！让他自己照顾自己吧！我会失去我生命中的机会和我心中对别人的渴望吗？你可以继续说不，Ettie: 总有一天你会说是的，而我还年轻，可以等待。”

He was a dangerous suitor, with his glib Irish tongue, and his pretty, coaxing ways. There was about him also that glamour of experience and of mystery which attracts a woman's interest, and finally her love. He could talk of the sweet valleys of County Monaghan from which he came, of the lovely, distant island, the low hills and green meadows of which seemed the more beautiful when imagination viewed them from this place of grime and snow.

他是个危险的求婚者，爱尔兰式的巧舌如簧，甜言蜜语。他身上还有经验和神秘的魅力，吸引着女人的兴趣，最后是她的爱情。他可以谈论他来自莫纳汉郡的甜蜜的山谷，谈论那个可爱的、遥远的岛屿，谈论那些低矮的山丘和绿色的草地，当想象从这个尘土飞扬的地方看它们时，它们显得更加美丽。

Then he was versed in the life of the cities of the North, of Detroit, and the lumber camps of Michigan, and finally of Chicago, where he had worked in a planing mill. And afterwards came the hint of romance, the feeling that strange things had happened to him in that great city, so strange and so intimate that they might not be spoken of. He spoke wistfully of a sudden leaving, a breaking of old ties, a flight into a strange world, ending in this dreary valley, and Ettie listened, her dark eyes gleaming with pity and with sympathy—those two qualities which may turn so rapidly and so naturally to love.

然后他熟悉了北方城市的生活，熟悉了底特律的生活，熟悉了密歇根州的木材营地，最后熟悉了芝加哥的生活，他在芝加哥的一家工厂工作。后来，他又有了一丝浪漫的感觉，觉得在这个伟大的城市里发生了一些奇怪的事情，这些事情是如此奇怪，如此亲密，以至于人们可能不会谈论它们。他若有所思地谈到了一次突然的离别，一次旧关系的断绝，一次进入一个陌生世界的飞行，在这个沉闷的山谷中结束，爱蒂听着，她那双黑色的眼睛闪烁着怜悯和同情ーー这两种品质可能会迅速而自然地转变为爱情。

McMurdo had obtained a temporary job as bookkeeper; for he was a well-educated man. This kept him out most of the day, and he had not found occasion yet to report himself to the head of the lodge of the Eminent Order of Freemen. He was reminded of his omission, however, by a visit one evening from Mike Scanlan, the fellow member whom he had met in the train. Scanlan, the small, sharp-faced, nervous, black-eyed man, seemed glad to see him once more. After a glass or two of whisky he broached the object of his visit.

麦克默多得到了一份临时簿记员的工作，因为他受过良好的教育。这使他白天大部分时间都不在家，而且他还没有找到机会向自由人杰出骑士团团长报到。然而，一天晚上，他在火车上遇到的同事迈克 · 斯坎兰来访，让他想起了自己的疏忽。斯坎兰，这个矮小、尖脸、神经质、黑眼睛的男人，似乎很高兴再次见到他。他喝了一两杯威士忌之后，提出了他此行的目的。

“Say, McMurdo,” said he, “I remembered your address, so l made bold to call. I'm surprised that you've not reported to the Bodymaster. Why haven't you seen Boss McGinty yet?”

“喂，麦克默多,”他说，“我记得你的地址，所以我大胆地打了个电话。我很惊讶你竟然没有向“身体大师”报告。你怎么还没见到麦金蒂老板?”

“Well, I had to find a job. I have been busy.”

“嗯，我得找份工作。我一直很忙。”

“You must find time for him if you have none for anything else. Good Lord, man! you're a fool not to have been down to the Union House and registered your name the first morning after you came here! If you run against him—well, you mustn't, that's all!”

”“如果你没有时间做别的事情，你就必须为他腾出时间。老天爷啊！你真是个傻瓜，来到这里第一天早上就没有到联合大厦登记你的名字！如果你和他竞选——好吧，你不能这样，就这样!”

McMurdo showed mild surprise. “I've been a member of the lodge for over two years, Scanlan, but I never heard that duties were so pressing as all that.”

麦克默多站表现出轻微的惊讶。“我已经在这里工作两年多了，斯坎兰，但我从未听说工作如此紧迫。”

“Maybe not in Chicago.”

“也许在芝加哥不会。”

“Well, it's the same society here.”

“嗯，这里的社会是一样的。”

“Is it?”

“是吗?”

Scanlan looked at him long and fixedly. There was something sinister in his eyes.

斯坎兰盯着他看了很长时间，眼睛里有种不祥的感觉。

“Isn't it?”

“不是吗?”

“You'll tell me that in a month's time. I hear you had a talk with the patrolmen after I left the train.”

“一个月以后你再告诉我吧。我听说我下火车后你和巡警谈过话。”

“How did you know that?”

“你怎么知道的?”

“Oh, it got about—things do get about for good and for bad in this district.”

“哦，这个地区的事情总是有好有坏。”

“Well, yes. I told the hounds what I thought of them.”

“是的，我告诉了猎犬我对他们的看法。”

“By the Lord, you'll be a man after McGinty's heart!”

“以上帝的名义，你会成为一个符合麦金蒂心意的男人!”

“What, does he hate the police too?”

“怎么，他也讨厌警察吗?”

Scanlan burst out laughing. “You go and see him, my lad,” said he as he took his leave. “It's not the police but you that he'll hate if you don't! Now, take a friend's advice and go at once!”

斯坎兰突然大笑起来。“你去看看他吧，我的孩子,”他说着离开了。“不是警察，而是你，如果你不这样做，他会恨你！现在，听从朋友的建议，马上离开吧!”

It chanced that on the same evening McMurdo had another more pressing interview which urged him in the same direction. It may have been that his attentions to Ettie had been more evident than before, or that they had gradually obtruded themselves into the slow mind of his good German host; but, whatever the cause, the boarding-house keeper beckoned the young man into his private room and started on the subject without any circumlocution.

恰巧在同一天晚上，麦克默多又接受了另一次更为紧迫的采访，促使他朝同一个方向走去。也许是因为他对爱蒂的关心比以前更加明显了，或者是因为他们渐渐地进入了他那德国好东道主的迟钝的心里; 但是，不管是什么原因，寄宿舍管理员把这个年轻人招进了他的私人房间，开始了这个话题，没有任何委婉的说辞。

“It seems to me, mister,” said he, “that you are gettin' set on my Ettie. Ain't that so, or am I wrong?”

“在我看来，先生,”他说，“你似乎对我的宠物很感兴趣。难道不是吗? 还是我错了?”

“Yes, that is so,” the young man answered.

“是的，就是这样,”年轻人回答。

“Vell, I vant to tell you right now that it ain't no manner of use. There's someone slipped in afore you.”

”“喂，我现在要告诉你，这是没有用的。在你之前有人溜进来了。”

“She told me so.”

“是她告诉我的。”

“Vell, you can lay that she told you truth. But did she tell you who it vas?”

“维尔，你可以说她说的是实话，但她告诉你是谁说的了吗?”

“No, I asked her; but she wouldn't tell.”

“没有，我问过她，但她不肯说。”

“I dare say not, the leetle baggage! Perhaps she did not vish to frighten you avay.”

“我敢说不是，这件事太多余了! 也许她不是故意吓唬你的。”

“Frighten!” McMurdo was on fire in a moment.

“吓死人了!”麦克默多站一下子就着火了。

“Ah, yes, my friend! You need not be ashamed to be frightened of him. It is Teddy Baldwin.”

“啊，是的，我的朋友! 你不必因为害怕他而感到羞愧。那就是特迪 · 鲍德温。”

“And who the devil is he?”

“他到底是谁?”

“He is a boss of Scowrers.”

“他是《新闻周刊》的老板。”

“Scowrers! I've heard of them before. It's Scowrers here and Scowrers there, and always in a whisper! What are you all afraid of? Who are the Scowrers?”

“斯科尔斯！我以前听说过他们。这里是新闻记者，那里是新闻记者，而且总是窃窃私语！你们都在害怕什么？谁是新闻记者?”

The boarding-house keeper instinctively sank his voice, as everyone did who talked about that terrible society. “The Scowrers,” said he, “are the Eminent Order of Freemen!”

寄宿舍管理员本能地压低了声音，就像每个谈论那个可怕社会的人一样。“斯考勒一家,”他说，“就是自由人的杰出骑士团!”

The young man stared. “Why, I am a member of that order myself.”

年轻人盯着他说: “为什么，我自己就是那个教派的一员。”

“You! I vould never have had you in my house if I had known it—not if you vere to pay me a hundred dollar a week.”

“你！如果我早知道的话，我就不会请你到我家来了ーー如果你每周付我一百美元的话，我就不会请你来了。”

“What's wrong with the order? It's for charity and good fellowship. The rules say so.”

“这个命令有什么问题? 这是为了慈善和良好的友谊。规则是这么说的。”

“Maybe in some places. Not here!”

“也许在某些地方是这样，但不是在这里!”

“What is it here?”

“这是什么?”

“It's a murder society, that's vat it is.”

“这是一个谋杀社会，这就是增值税。”

McMurdo laughed incredulously. “How can you prove that?” he asked.

麦克默多站怀疑地笑了起来，“你怎么能证明呢?”他问。

“Prove it! Are there not fifty murders to prove it? Vat about Milman and Van Shorst, and the Nicholson family, and old Mr. Hyam, and little Billy James, and the others? Prove it! Is there a man or a voman in this valley vat does not know it?”

“证明给我看！难道没有50起谋杀案可以证明吗？还有米尔曼和范 · 肖尔斯特，尼科尔森一家，老海姆先生，小比利 · 詹姆斯，还有其他人？证明给我看！这山谷里有没有一个人或一个呕吐物不知道呢?”

“See here!” said McMurdo earnestly. “I want you to take back what you've said, or else make it good. One or the other you must do before I quit this room. Put yourself in my place. Here am I, a stranger in the town. I belong to a society that I know only as an innocent one. You'll find it through the length and breadth of the States, but always as an innocent one. Now, when I am counting upon joining it here, you tell me that it is the same as a murder society called the Scowrers. I guess you owe me either an apology or else an explanation, Mr. Shafter.”

“看这儿!”麦克默多站认真地说。”“我要你收回你所说的话，否则就把它变好。在我离开这个房间之前，你必须做这个或那个。设身处地为我想想。我在这里，一个镇上的陌生人。我属于一个我只知道是天真无邪的社会。你可以在美国的各个地方找到它，但总是那么天真无邪。现在，当我打算加入这里，你告诉我，这是一个谋杀社会所谓的斯考尔。我想你要么向我道歉，要么向我解释，肖夫特先生。”

“I can but tell you vat the whole vorld knows, mister. The bosses of the one are the bosses of the other. If you offend the one, it is the other vat vill strike you. We have proved it too often.”

”“我只能告诉你，先生，整个世界都知道。一个人的老板就是另一个人的老板。如果你冒犯了其中一个，那么另一个就会打你。我们已经证明了太多次。”

“That's just gossip—I want proof!” said McMurdo.

“那只是谣言ーー我要证据!”麦克默多站表示。

“If you live here long you vill get your proof. But I forget that you are yourself one of them. You vill soon be as bad as the rest. But you vill find other lodgings, mister. I cannot have you here. Is it not bad enough that one of these people come courting my Ettie, and that I dare not turn him down, but that I should have another for my boarder? Yes, indeed, you shall not sleep here after to-night!”

”“如果你在这儿住久了，你就会得到证明的。但是我忘了你就是他们中的一员。你很快就会变得和其他人一样坏。但是你会找到其他住处的，先生。我不能让你留在这里。这些人中的一个来追求我的爱蒂，我不敢拒绝他，但是我应该为我的寄宿生再找一个，这还不够糟糕吗？是的，你今天晚上以后就不能在这儿睡觉了!”

McMurdo found himself under sentence of banishment both from his comfortable quarters and from the girl whom he loved. He found her alone in the sitting-room that same evening, and he poured his troubles into her ear.

麦克默多站发现自己被逐出舒适的住所和他爱的女孩。那天晚上，他发现她独自一人在起居室里，就把自己的烦恼告诉了她。

“Sure, your father is after giving me notice,” he said. “It's little I would care if it was just my room, but indeed, Ettie, though it's only a week that I've known you, you are the very breath of life to me, and I can't live without you!”

“当然，你父亲已经提前通知我了,”他说。“即使只是我的房间，我也不在乎，但是，爱蒂，虽然我认识你才一个星期，你是我生命的呼吸，没有你我活不下去!”

“Oh, hush, Mr. McMurdo, don't speak so!” said the girl. “I have told you, have I not, that you are too late? There is another, and if I have not promised to marry him at once, at least I can promise no one else.”

“哦，安静，麦克默多先生，别这么说!”女孩说。”“我已经告诉过你了，不是吗？还有一个，如果我没有立刻答应嫁给他，至少我不能答应别人。”

“Suppose I had been first, Ettie, would I have had a chance?”

“假如我是第一个，埃蒂，我还有机会吗?”

The girl sank her face into her hands. “I wish to heaven that you had been first!” she sobbed.

女孩把脸埋在双手里。“我真希望你是第一个!”她抽泣着说。

McMurdo was down on his knees before her in an instant. “For God's sake, Ettie, let it stand at that!” he cried. “Will you ruin your life and my own for the sake of this promise? Follow your heart, acushla! 'Tis a safer guide than any promise before you knew what it was that you were saying.”

麦克默多立刻跪在她面前。“看在上帝的份上，埃蒂，就这样吧!”他哭了起来。“你会为了这个承诺而毁了你自己和我自己的生活吗？跟随你的心，acushla！在你还不知道自己在说什么之前，这比任何承诺都要安全。”

He had seized Ettie's white hand between his own strong brown ones.

他用自己强壮的棕色手掌抓住了埃蒂的白手。

“Say that you will be mine, and we will face it out together!”

“说你是我的，我们一起面对!”

“Not here?”

“不在这儿?”

“Yes, here.”

“是的，在这里。”

“No, no, Jack!” His arms were round her now. “It could not be here. Could you take me away?”

“不，不，杰克!”他双臂环抱着她。“它不可能在这里。你能把我带走吗?”

A struggle passed for a moment over McMurdo's face; but it ended by setting like granite. “No, here,” he said. “I'll hold you against the world, Ettie, right here where we are!”

麦克默多的脸上掠过一阵挣扎，最后像花岗岩一样硬了下来。“不，在这儿,”他说。“我要把你留在这个世界上，伊蒂，就在我们现在的地方!”

“Why should we not leave together?”

“我们为什么不能一起离开呢?”

“No, Ettie, I can't leave here.”

“不，埃蒂，我不能离开这里。”

“But why?”

“但为什么呢?”

“I'd never hold my head up again if I felt that I had been driven out. Besides, what is there to be afraid of? Are we not free folks in a free country? If you love me, and I you, who will dare to come between?”

“如果我觉得自己被赶出去了，我再也不会抬起头来了。再说，有什么好怕的呢？难道我们不是自由国家的自由人民吗？如果你爱我，而我爱你，谁还敢介入?”

“You don't know, Jack. You've been here too short a time. You don't know this Baldwin. You don't know McGinty and his Scowrers.”

“你不知道，杰克。你来这里的时间太短了。你不了解鲍德温。你不了解麦金蒂和他的记者们。”

“No, I don't know them, and I don't fear them, and I don't believe in them!” said McMurdo. “I've lived among rough men, my darling, and instead of fearing them it has always ended that they have feared me—always, Ettie. It's mad on the face of it! If these men, as your father says, have done crime after crime in the valley, and if everyone knows them by name, how comes it that none are brought to justice? You answer me that, Ettie!”

“不，我不认识他们，我不怕他们，我也不相信他们!”麦克默多站说。“我生活在粗野的人群中，亲爱的，他们总是害怕我而不是害怕他们——一直都是，埃蒂。从表面上看，这简直是疯了！如果这些人，像你父亲说的，在山谷里犯了一个又一个的罪，如果每个人都知道他们的名字，为什么没有人被绳之以法？你回答我，埃蒂!”

“Because no witness dares to appear against them. He would not live a month if he did. Also because they have always their own men to swear that the accused one was far from the scene of the crime. But surely, Jack, you must have read all this. I had understood that every paper in the United States was writing about it.”

“因为没有证人敢出庭指控他们。如果他这样做，他活不过一个月。还因为他们总是让自己的手下发誓说，被告人离犯罪现场很远。但是，杰克，你一定读过这些。我知道美国的每一家报纸都在报道这件事。”

“Well, I have read something, it is true; but I had thought it was a story. Maybe these men have some reason in what they do. Maybe they are wronged and have no other way to help themselves.”

”“嗯，我读过一些东西，是真的，但是我以为那是一个故事。也许这些人做这些事情是有原因的。也许他们被冤枉了，没有别的办法可以自救。”

“Oh, Jack, don't let me hear you speak so! That is how he speaks—the other one!”

“哦，杰克，别让我听见你这么说话! 他就是这么说话的ーー另一个人!”

“Baldwin—he speaks like that, does he?”

“鲍德温——他就是这么说话的，是吗?”

“And that is why I loathe him so. Oh, Jack, now I can tell you the truth. I loathe him with all my heart; but I fear him also. I fear him for myself; but above all I fear him for father. I know that some great sorrow would come upon us if I dared to say what I really felt. That is why I have put him off with half-promises. It was in real truth our only hope. But if you would fly with me, Jack, we could take father with us and live forever far from the power of these wicked men.”

“这就是为什么我这么讨厌他。杰克，现在我可以告诉你真相了。我从心里厌恶他，也惧怕他。我怕他是为我自己，但最重要的是，我怕他是我的父亲。我知道，如果我敢说出我的真实感受，我们将会遭受巨大的悲痛。这就是为什么我半信半疑地拒绝了他。事实上，这是我们唯一的希望。但是如果你愿意和我一起飞行，杰克，我们可以带着父亲一起飞行，永远远离这些恶人的魔力。”

Again there was the struggle upon McMurdo's face, and again it set like granite. “No harm shall come to you, Ettie—nor to your father either. As to wicked men, I expect you may find that I am as bad as the worst of them before we're through.”

麦克默多的脸上又出现了挣扎的表情，而且又像花岗岩一样坚硬。“你不会受到任何伤害，埃蒂，你的父亲也不会。至于邪恶的人，我想在我们结束之前，你会发现我和他们中最坏的一个一样坏。”

“No, no, Jack! I would trust you anywhere.”

“不，不，杰克! 无论如何我都相信你。”

McMurdo laughed bitterly. “Good Lord! how little you know of me! Your innocent soul, my darling, could not even guess what is passing in mine. But, hullo, who's the visitor?”

麦克默多站笑得很苦。“上帝啊！你对我知之甚少！我亲爱的，你那纯真的灵魂，甚至猜不出我的灵魂在想些什么。可是，喂，那个客人是谁?”

The door had opened suddenly, and a young fellow came swaggering in with the air of one who is the master. He was a handsome, dashing young man of about the same age and build as McMurdo himself. Under his broad-brimmed black felt hat, which he had not troubled to remove, a handsome face with fierce, domineering eyes and a curved hawk-bill of a nose looked savagely at the pair who sat by the stove.

门突然开了，一个年轻人大摇大摆地走了进来，好像是主人一样。他是个英俊潇洒的年轻人，年纪和麦克默多站差不多，身材也跟他差不多。宽边黑毡帽下面，一张英俊的脸，一双凶狠霸道的眼睛，一只弯弯的鹰嘴鼻子，凶狠地望着坐在炉子旁边的那一对。

Ettie had jumped to her feet full of confusion and alarm. “I'm glad to see you, Mr. Baldwin,” said she. “You're earlier than I had thought. Come and sit down.”

埃蒂惊慌失措地跳了起来。“很高兴见到你，鲍德温先生,”她说。“你比我想象的还要早。过来坐下。”

Baldwin stood with his hands on his hips looking at McMurdo. “Who is this?” he asked curtly.

鲍德温双手叉腰站在那里看着麦克默多站，“这是谁?”。

“It's a friend of mine, Mr. Baldwin, a new boarder here. Mr. McMurdo, may I introduce you to Mr. Baldwin?”

“是我的一个朋友，鲍德温先生，这里的一个新房客。麦克默多先生，我可以把你介绍给鲍德温先生吗?”

The young men nodded in surly fashion to each other.

那些年轻人不高兴地互相点点头。

“Maybe Miss Ettie has told you how it is with us?” said Baldwin.

“也许埃蒂小姐已经告诉你我们的情况了?”鲍德温说。

“I didn't understand that there was any relation between you.”

“我不明白你们之间有什么关系。”

“Didn't you? Well, you can understand it now. You can take it from me that this young lady is mine, and you'll find it a very fine evening for a walk.”

“不是吗？现在你可以理解了。你可以相信我，这位小姐是我的，你会发现这是一个散步的好夜晚。”

“Thank you, I am in no humour for a walk.”

“谢谢，我现在没心情散步。”

“Aren't you?” The man's savage eyes were blazing with anger. “Maybe you are in a humour for a fight, Mr. Boarder!”

“你不是吗?”那人凶恶的眼睛里闪烁着愤怒的光芒。“也许你是想打架，鲍德先生!”

“That I am!” cried McMurdo, springing to his feet. “You never said a more welcome word.”

“我就是!”麦克默多跳起来喊道，“你从来没有说过比这更受欢迎的话。”

“For God's sake, Jack! Oh, for God's sake!” cried poor, distracted Ettie. “Oh, Jack, Jack, he will hurt you!”

“看在上帝的份上，杰克! 哦，看在上帝的份上!”可怜的、心烦意乱的埃蒂叫道。“哦，杰克，杰克，他会伤害你的!”

“Oh, it's Jack, is it?” said Baldwin with an oath. “You've come to that already, have you?”

“哦，是杰克，是吗?”鲍德温发誓说。“你已经说到这一步了，是吗?”

“Oh, Ted, be reasonable—be kind! For my sake, Ted, if ever you loved me, be big-hearted and forgiving!”

“哦，泰德，理智一点ーー善良一点! 看在我的份上，泰德，如果你曾经爱过我，请宽宏大量，原谅我吧!”

“I think, Ettie, that if you were to leave us alone we could get this thing settled,” said McMurdo quietly. “Or maybe, Mr. Baldwin, you will take a turn down the street with me. It's a fine evening, and there's some open ground beyond the next block.”

“我想，埃蒂，如果你让我们单独待会儿，我们就能解决这件事,”麦克默多站平静地说。“或者，鲍德温先生，你可以和我一起在街上转一个弯。这是一个晴朗的夜晚，隔壁街区还有一片空地。”

“I'll get even with you without needing to dirty my hands,” said his enemy. “You'll wish you had never set foot in this house before I am through with you!”

“我要报复你，而不必弄脏我的手,”他的敌人说。“你会希望在我和你分手之前你从来没有踏进这所房子一步!”

“No time like the present,” cried McMurdo.

“没有比现在更好的时机了,”麦克默多喊道。

“I'll choose my own time, mister. You can leave the time to me. See here!” He suddenly rolled up his sleeve and showed upon his forearm a peculiar sign which appeared to have been branded there. It was a circle with a triangle within it. “D'you know what that means?”

“先生，我会自己选择时间的。你可以把时间留给我。看这里!”他突然卷起袖子，在前臂上露出一个奇怪的标志，似乎被打上了烙印。那是一个圆圈，里面有一个三角形。“你知道那是什么意思吗?”

“I neither know nor care!”

“我既不知道也不在乎!”

“Well, you will know, I'll promise you that. You won't be much older, either. Perhaps Miss Ettie can tell you something about it. As to you, Ettie, you'll come back to me on your knees—d'ye hear, girl?—on your knees—and then I'll tell you what your punishment may be. You've sowed—and by the Lord, I'll see that you reap!” He glanced at them both in fury. Then he turned upon his heel, and an instant later the outer door had banged behind him.

”“好吧，你会知道的，我向你保证。你也不会老太多。也许埃蒂小姐可以告诉你一些事情。至于你，埃蒂，你要跪着回到我身边来ーー听见了吗，姑娘? ーー跪下来ーー然后我再告诉你你会受到什么样的惩罚。你已经播种了，我以上帝的名义发誓，我要看着你收割!”他愤怒地瞥了他们两个一眼。然后他转过身去，不一会儿外面的门在他身后砰地一声关上了。

For a few moments McMurdo and the girl stood in silence. Then she threw her arms around him.

麦克默多站和女孩静静地站了一会儿，然后伸出双臂拥抱了他。

“Oh, Jack, how brave you were! But it is no use, you must fly! To-night—Jack—to-night! It's your only hope. He will have your life. I read it in his horrible eyes. What chance have you against a dozen of them, with Boss McGinty and all the power of the lodge behind them?”

“哦，杰克，你真勇敢！但这是没有用的，你必须飞！今晚ー杰克ー今晚！这是你唯一的希望。他会夺走你的生命。我从他那双可怕的眼睛里看出来了。你有什么机会对付他们十几个人呢? 麦金蒂老板和他们背后那些有权有势的人?”

McMurdo disengaged her hands, kissed her, and gently pushed her back into a chair. “There, acushla, there! Don't be disturbed or fear for me. I'm a Freeman myself. I'm after telling your father about it. Maybe I am no better than the others; so don't make a saint of me. Perhaps you hate me too, now that I've told you as much?”

麦克默多松开她的双手，吻了吻她，然后轻轻地把她推到椅子上。“那儿，acushla，那儿！不要为我担心。我自己也是自由人。我要把这事告诉你父亲。也许我并不比别人好，所以不要把我当成圣人。也许你也恨我，因为我已经告诉你这么多了?”

“Hate you, Jack? While life lasts I could never do that! I've heard that there is no harm in being a Freeman anywhere but here; so why should I think the worse of you for that? But if you are a Freeman, Jack, why should you not go down and make a friend of Boss McGinty? Oh, hurry, Jack, hurry! Get your word in first, or the hounds will be on your trail.”

“恨你，杰克？只要生命还在继续，我就永远做不到！我听说除了在这里做自由人，在任何地方做自由人都没有坏处; 那么为什么我要因此而对你有更坏的看法呢？但是如果你是自由人，杰克，你为什么不下去和麦金蒂老板交个朋友呢？快点，杰克，快点！先把话说清楚，否则猎犬就会追上你。”

“I was thinking the same thing,” said McMurdo. “I'll go right now and fix it. You can tell your father that I'll sleep here to-night and find some other quarters in the morning.”

“我也是这么想的,”麦克默多站表示。“我现在就去修。你可以告诉你父亲，我今天晚上睡在这儿，明天早上再找个地方住。”

The bar of McGinty's saloon was crowded as usual, for it was the favourite loafing place of all the rougher elements of the town. The man was popular; for he had a rough, jovial disposition which formed a mask, covering a great deal which lay behind it. But apart from this popularity, the fear in which he was held throughout the township, and indeed down the whole thirty miles of the valley and past the mountains on each side of it, was enough in itself to fill his bar; for none could afford to neglect his good will.

麦金蒂酒店的酒吧像往常一样挤满了人，因为这是城里所有比较粗野的人最喜欢去的地方。这个人很受欢迎，因为他有一种粗野、快乐的性格，这种性格形成了一副面具，遮住了面具后面的许多东西。但是除了这种受欢迎的程度之外，他在整个镇上，甚至整个山谷的三十英里范围内，穿过两边的群山所产生的恐惧本身就足以填满他的酒吧，因为没有人能够忽视他的好意。

Besides those secret powers which it was universally believed that he exercised in so pitiless a fashion, he was a high public official, a municipal councillor, and a commissioner of roads, elected to the office through the votes of the ruffians who in turn expected to receive favours at his hands. Assessments and taxes were enormous; the public works were notoriously neglected, the accounts were slurred over by bribed auditors, and the decent citizen was terrorized into paying public blackmail, and holding his tongue lest some worse thing befall him.

除了那些人们普遍认为他无情地行使的秘密权力之外，他还是一名高级公职人员，一名内阁参事官，一名道路专员，通过暴徒的投票当选为公职人员，而这些暴徒反过来又希望从他手中得到好处。评估和税收是巨大的; 公共工程是出了名的被忽视，账目被受贿的审计员弄得一塌糊涂，体面的公民被恐吓付出公共敲诈，保持沉默，以免更糟糕的事情降临到他头上。

Thus it was that, year by year, Boss McGinty's diamond pins became more obtrusive, his gold chains more weighty across a more gorgeous vest, and his saloon stretched farther and farther, until it threatened to absorb one whole side of the Market Square.

就这样，年复一年，麦金蒂老板的钻石别针越来越显眼，他的金链越来越沉重，背心越来越华丽，他的轿车越来越长，直到要把市场广场的整个一面都吸收进去。

McMurdo pushed open the swinging door of the saloon and made his way amid the crowd of men within, through an atmosphere blurred with tobacco smoke and heavy with the smell of spirits. The place was brilliantly lighted, and the huge, heavily gilt mirrors upon every wall reflected and multiplied the garish illumination. There were several bartenders in their shirt sleeves, hard at work mixing drinks for the loungers who fringed the broad, brass-trimmed counter.

麦克默多站推开酒吧的摇摆门，在里面的人群中穿行，穿过一片烟雾弥漫、浓烈的烈酒气味弥漫的空气。这个地方灯火辉煌，每面墙上巨大的镀金镜子反射出耀眼的光芒。有几个酒保穿着衬衫袖子，正在为那些在宽大的、黄铜边的柜台上装饰流苏的闲人调制饮料。

At the far end, with his body resting upon the bar and a cigar stuck at an acute angle from the corner of his mouth, stood a tall, strong, heavily built man who could be none other than the famous McGinty himself. He was a black-maned giant, bearded to the cheek-bones, and with a shock of raven hair which fell to his collar. His complexion was as swarthy as that of an Italian, and his eyes were of a strange dead black, which, combined with a slight squint, gave them a particularly sinister appearance.

远处，他的身体靠在吧台上，嘴角上叼着一支尖尖的雪茄，站着一个身材高大、健壮、体格魁梧的男人，不是别人，正是著名的麦金蒂本人。他是一个黑须巨人，胡子长到颧骨，一头乌黑的头发垂到衣领上。他的肤色像意大利人一样黝黑，他的眼睛是一种奇怪的死黑色，再加上轻微的斜视，使他们看起来特别凶恶。

All else in the man—his noble proportions, his fine features, and his frank bearing—fitted in with that jovial, man-to-man manner which he affected. Here, one would say, is a bluff, honest fellow, whose heart would be sound however rude his outspoken words might seem. It was only when those dead, dark eyes, deep and remorseless, were turned upon a man that he shrank within himself, feeling that he was face to face with an infinite possibility of latent evil, with a strength and courage and cunning behind it which made it a thousand times more deadly.

这个人身上的其他一切——他高贵的身材，他优美的容貌，他坦率的举止——都符合他所表现出来的那种愉快的、一个人对一个人的态度。在这里，有人会说，是一个虚张声势，诚实的家伙，他的心将听起来无论他的直言不讳的话可能显得粗鲁。只有当那双死气沉沉、深邃而冷酷的黑眼睛转向一个男人时，他才感到自己正面临着一种无限可能的潜在邪恶，这种邪恶背后蕴藏着力量、勇气和狡猾，使它的致命性增加了一千倍。

Having had a good look at his man, McMurdo elbowed his way forward with his usual careless audacity, and pushed himself through the little group of courtiers who were fawning upon the powerful boss, laughing uproariously at the smallest of his jokes. The young stranger's bold gray eyes looked back fearlessly through their glasses at the deadly black ones which turned sharply upon him.

麦克默多仔细观察了他的手下之后，用他惯有的无所顾忌的勇气挤向前去，挤过一小群朝臣，这些朝臣奉承着这位有权有势的老板，听到他讲的最微不足道的笑话就哈哈大笑。年轻的陌生人大胆的灰色眼睛，无所畏惧地透过眼镜回头望着那些锐利地转向他的致命的黑色眼睛。

“Well, young man, I can't call your face to mind.”

“好吧，年轻人，我想不起来你是谁。”

“I'm new here, Mr. McGinty.”

“我是新来的，麦金蒂先生。”

“You are not so new that you can't give a gentleman his proper title.”

“你并不是新来的，不能给一个绅士一个应有的头衔。”

“He's Councillor McGinty, young man,” said a voice from the group.

“他是麦金蒂议员，年轻人,”一个声音从人群中传来。

“I'm sorry, Councillor. I'm strange to the ways of the place. But I was advised to see you.”

“对不起，议员先生。我对这个地方的习惯很陌生，但有人建议我来看看您。”

“Well, you see me. This is all there is. What d'you think of me?”

“好吧，你看我。这就是全部了。你觉得我怎么样?”

“Well, it's early days. If your heart is as big as your body, and your soul as fine as your face, then I'd ask for nothing better,” said McMurdo.

“好吧，现在还为时过早。如果你的心和你的身体一样大，你的灵魂和你的脸一样美好，那么我就没有什么要求更好了,”麦克默多站说。

“By Gar! you've got an Irish tongue in your head anyhow,” cried the saloon-keeper, not quite certain whether to humour this audacious visitor or to stand upon his dignity.

“以加尔之名！“不管怎么说，你的脑袋里有一张爱尔兰人的舌头,”酒店老板喊道，他不太确定是要迁就这个大胆的客人，还是要维护他的尊严。

“So you are good enough to pass my appearance?”

“这么说你够格通过我的检查了?”

“Sure,” said McMurdo.

“当然,”麦克默多站说。

“And you were told to see me?”

“有人叫你来见我?”

“I was.”

“是的。”

“And who told you?”

“谁告诉你的?”

“Brother Scanlan of Lodge 341, Vermissa. I drink your health Councillor, and to our better acquaintance.” He raised a glass with which he had been served to his lips and elevated his little finger as he drank it.

“ Vermissa，Lodge 341的 Scanlan 修士。我为你的健康干杯，为我们更好的朋友干杯。”他举起一只杯子，杯子已经端到他的嘴唇上，他一边喝，一边竖起小指。

McGinty, who had been watching him narrowly, raised his thick black eyebrows. “Oh, it's like that, is it?” said he. “I'll have to look a bit closer into this, Mister—”

麦金蒂一直仔细地看着他，抬起了他那浓密的黑眉毛。“哦，就是这样，是吗?”他说。“我得仔细看看这个，先生——”

“McMurdo.”

“麦克默多。”

“A bit closer, Mr. McMurdo; for we don't take folk on trust in these parts, nor believe all we're told neither. Come in here for a moment, behind the bar.”

“再近一点，麦克默多先生，因为我们不相信这些地方的人，也不相信别人告诉我们的一切。到吧台后面来一会儿。”

There was a small room there, lined with barrels. McGinty carefully closed the door, and then seated himself on one of them, biting thoughtfully on his cigar and surveying his companion with those disquieting eyes. For a couple of minutes he sat in complete silence. McMurdo bore the inspection cheerfully, one hand in his coat pocket, the other twisting his brown moustache. Suddenly McGinty stooped and produced a wicked-looking revolver.

那里有一个小房间，两边排列着木桶。麦金蒂小心翼翼地关上门，然后坐在其中一个上面，若有所思地咬着雪茄，用那令人不安的眼睛打量着他的同伴。他静静地坐了几分钟。麦克默多高高兴兴地接受了检查，一只手放在上衣口袋里，另一只手捻着棕色的胡子。突然，麦金蒂弯下腰，拿出一把看上去很邪恶的左轮手枪。

“See here, my joker,” said he, “if I thought you were playing any game on us, it would be short work for you.”

“听着，我的小丑,”他说，“如果我以为你在跟我们玩什么把戏，那对你来说就是小菜一碟了。”

“This is a strange welcome,” McMurdo answered with some dignity, “for the Bodymaster of a lodge of Freemen to give to a stranger brother.”

“这是一种奇怪的欢迎,”麦克默多带着几分尊严地回答，“自由人小屋的身体主人给了一个陌生的兄弟。”

“Ay, but it's just that same that you have to prove,” said McGinty, “and God help you if you fail! Where were you made?”

“是的，但是同样的，你必须证明,”麦金蒂说，“如果你失败了，上帝会帮助你的!”！你是在哪里生产的?”

“Lodge 29, Chicago.”

”芝加哥29号小屋”

“When?”

“什么时候?”

“June 24, 1872.”

“1872年6月24日。”

“What Bodymaster?”

“什么健美大师?”

“James H. Scott.”

“詹姆斯 · h · 斯科特。”

“Who is your district ruler?”

“谁是你们地方的统治者?”

“Bartholomew Wilson.”

“巴塞洛缪 · 威尔逊。”

“Hum! You seem glib enough in your tests. What are you doing here?”

“哼! 你的考试看起来很油嘴滑舌。你在这儿干什么?”

“Working, the same as you—but a poorer job.”

“工作，和你一样ーー只是工作更差。”

“You have your back answer quick enough.”

“你的回答够快了。”

“Yes, I was always quick of speech.”

“是的，我说话总是很快。”

“Are you quick of action?”

“你行动敏捷吗?”

“I have had that name among those that knew me best.”

“在那些最了解我的人中，我有过这个名字。”

“Well, we may try you sooner than you think. Have you heard anything of the lodge in these parts?”

“好吧，我们可能会比你想象的更快地找到你。你听说过这一带的旅馆吗?”

“I've heard that it takes a man to be a brother.”

“我听说，一个男人才能成为一个兄弟。”

“True for you, Mr. McMurdo. Why did you leave Chicago?”

“你说得对，麦克默多先生。你为什么离开芝加哥?”

“I'm damned if I tell you that!”

“如果我告诉你那件事，我就完了!”

McGinty opened his eyes. He was not used to being answered in such fashion, and it amused him. “Why won't you tell me?”

麦金蒂睁开了眼睛。他不习惯别人这样回答他，这使他觉得好笑。“你为什么不告诉我?”

“Because no brother may tell another a lie.”

“因为兄弟之间不能说谎。”

“Then the truth is too bad to tell?”

“那么真相太糟糕了，难以启齿?”

“You can put it that way if you like.”

“如果你愿意，你可以这么说。”

“See here, mister, you can't expect me, as Bodymaster, to pass into the lodge a man for whose past he can't answer.”

“听着，先生，你不能指望我，作为一个身体大师，把一个过去无法回答的人送进小屋。”

McMurdo looked puzzled. Then he took a worn newspaper cutting from an inner pocket.

麦克默多站看起来很困惑，然后他从内兜里掏出一张破旧的剪报。

“You wouldn't squeal on a fellow?” said he.

“你不会告发别人吧?”他说。

“I'll wipe my hand across your face if you say such words to me!” cried McGinty hotly.

“如果你对我说这样的话，我就用手擦你的脸!”麦金蒂激动地喊道。

“You are right, Councillor,” said McMurdo meekly. “I should apologize. I spoke without thought. Well, I know that I am safe in your hands. Look at that clipping.”

“你说得对，议员,”麦克默多温顺地说。“我应该道歉。我不假思索地说。我知道我在你手里很安全。看看这剪报。”

McGinty glanced his eyes over the account of the shooting of one Jonas Pinto, in the Lake Saloon, Market Street, Chicago, in the New Year week of 1874.

1874年新年那个星期，麦金蒂扫视了一下眼前发生在芝加哥市场街的湖边沙龙枪击乔纳斯 · 平托的事情。

“Your work?” he asked, as he handed back the paper.

“你的工作?”他一边问，一边把报纸递了回去。

McMurdo nodded.

麦克默多站点点头。

“Why did you shoot him?”

“你为什么开枪打他?”

“I was helping Uncle Sam to make dollars. Maybe mine were not as good gold as his, but they looked as well and were cheaper to make. This man Pinto helped me to shove the queer—”

“我在帮山姆大叔赚钱。也许我的金子没有他的好，但是它们看起来也不错，而且制造成本更低。这个叫平托的家伙帮我把那个奇怪的东西推进去——”

“To do what?”

“做什么?”

“Well, it means to pass the dollars out into circulation. Then he said he would split. Maybe he did split. I didn't wait to see. I just killed him and lighted out for the coal country.”

“嗯，这意味着把美元发行到流通领域。然后他说他要离开。也许他真的离开了。我迫不及待地想看看。我只是杀了他，然后飞奔到煤炭之乡。”

“Why the coal country?”

“为什么是煤炭国家?”

“'Cause I'd read in the papers that they weren't too particular in those parts.”

“因为我在报纸上看到，他们对这些部分并不是特别挑剔。”

McGinty laughed. “You were first a coiner and then a murderer, and you came to these parts because you thought you'd be welcome.”

麦金蒂笑了。“你一开始是个工人，然后是个杀人犯，你来到这里是因为你觉得你会受到欢迎。”

“That's about the size of it,” McMurdo answered.

“这就是它的规模,”麦克默多回答说。

“Well, I guess you'll go far. Say, can you make those dollars yet?”

“嗯，我想你会走得很远的。说吧，你能赚到那些美元吗?”

McMurdo took half a dozen from his pocket. “Those never passed the Philadelphia mint,” said he.

麦克默多从他的口袋里掏出了半打，“那些从来没有通过费城铸币局,”他说。

“You don't say!” McGinty held them to the light in his enormous hand, which was hairy as a gorilla's. “I can see no difference. Gar! you'll be a mighty useful brother, I'm thinking! We can do with a bad man or two among us, Friend McMurdo: for there are times when we have to take our own part. We'd soon be against the wall if we didn't shove back at those that were pushing us.”

“你不用说!”麦金蒂用他巨大的手拿着它们，手上的毛像大猩猩的一样多。“我看不出有什么不同。加！我在想，你会成为一个非常有用的兄弟！我们可以对付我们中间的一两个坏人，朋友麦克默多: 因为有时候我们必须做我们自己的事情。如果我们不回击那些逼迫我们的人，我们很快就会被逼到墙角。”

“Well, I guess I'll do my share of shoving with the rest of the boys.”

“好吧，我想我得和其他男孩子们挤挤了。”

“You seem to have a good nerve. You didn't squirm when I shoved this gun at you.”

“你好像很有勇气，我用枪指着你的时候，你没有扭动。”

“It was not me that was in danger.”

“处于危险中的不是我。”

“Who then?”

“那是谁?”

“It was you, Councillor.” McMurdo drew a cocked pistol from the side pocket of his peajacket. “I was covering you all the time. I guess my shot would have been as quick as yours.”

“是你，议员。”麦克默多从夹克衫的侧兜里掏出一把上了膛的手枪。“我一直在掩护你。我想我的投篮会和你的一样快。”

“By Gar!” McGinty flushed an angry red and then burst into a roar of laughter. “Say, we've had no such holy terror come to hand this many a year. I reckon the lodge will learn to be proud of you … Well, what the hell do you want? And can't I speak alone with a gentleman for five minutes but you must butt in on us?”

“被加!”麦金蒂的脸涨得通红，然后爆发出一阵大笑。”“你说，这么多年来，我们从来没有遇到过这么可怕的事情。我想旅馆会以你为荣的... 你到底想要什么？难道我不能和一位先生单独谈五分钟，但你一定要插嘴吗?”

The bartender stood abashed. “I'm sorry, Councillor, but it's Ted Baldwin. He says he must see you this very minute.”

酒保羞愧地站着。“对不起，议员，但是是泰德 · 鲍德温。他说他必须马上见你。”

The message was unnecessary; for the set, cruel face of the man himself was looking over the servant's shoulder. He pushed the bartender out and closed the door on him.

这个消息是没有必要的，因为那个男人自己那张残酷的脸正从仆人的肩膀上看过去。他推开酒保，关上了门。

“So,” said he with a furious glance at McMurdo, “you got here first, did you? I've a word to say to you, Councillor, about this man.”

“那么,”他愤怒地看了一眼麦克默多站说，“你先到的，是吗？议员，关于这个人，我有话要跟您说。”

“Then say it here and now before my face,” cried McMurdo.

“那就在我面前说吧,”麦克默多喊道。

“I'll say it at my own time, in my own way.”

“我会在我自己的时间说，用我自己的方式。”

“Tut! Tut!” said McGinty, getting off his barrel. “This will never do. We have a new brother here, Baldwin, and it's not for us to greet him in such fashion. Hold out your hand, man, and make it up!”

“啧！啧!”麦金蒂一边说着，一边从桶里爬出来。“这绝对行不通。我们在这里有了一个新的弟弟，鲍德温，我们不应该用这种方式来迎接他。伸出你的手，伙计，补偿一下吧!”

“Never!” cried Baldwin in a fury.

“决不!”鲍德温愤怒地喊道。

“I've offered to fight him if he thinks I have wronged him,” said McMurdo. “I'll fight him with fists, or, if that won't satisfy him, I'll fight him any other way he chooses. Now, I'll leave it to you, Councillor, to judge between us as a Bodymaster should.”

“如果他认为我冤枉了他，我愿意与他决斗,”麦克默多站表示。”“我要用拳头打他，如果他不满意，我可以用他选择的任何方法打他。现在，我把这件事交给你，议员，让你作为一个健身教练来判断我们之间的关系。”

“What is it, then?”

“那是什么?”

“A young lady. She's free to choose for herself.”

“一位年轻的女士，她可以自由选择。”

“Is she?” cried Baldwin.

“是吗?”鲍德温叫道。

“As between two brothers of the lodge I should say that she was,” said the Boss.

老板说: “我敢肯定，她是这个小屋的两个兄弟之一。”。

“Oh, that's your ruling, is it?”

“哦，这就是你的裁决，是吗?”

“Yes, it is, Ted Baldwin,” said McGinty, with a wicked stare. “Is it you that would dispute it?”

“是的，特德 · 鲍德温,”麦金蒂恶狠狠地盯着他说，“你会反驳吗?”

“You would throw over one that has stood by you this five years in favour of a man that you never saw before in your life? You're not Bodymaster for life, Jack McGinty, and by God! when next it comes to a vote—”

“你会为了一个你从未见过的人而抛弃这五年来一直支持你的人吗？你不是终生的肉体大师，杰克 · 麦金蒂，上帝保佑！当下一次投票时...”

The Councillor sprang at him like a tiger. His hand closed round the other's neck, and he hurled him back across one of the barrels. In his mad fury he would have squeezed the life out of him if McMurdo had not interfered.

议员像老虎一样扑向他。他的手紧紧地搂住另一个人的脖子，把他甩回到一个桶上。如果麦克默多没有干涉的话，他就会在狂怒中把他的生命榨干。

“Easy, Councillor! For heaven's sake, go easy!” he cried, as he dragged him back.

“放松点，议员! 看在上帝的份上，放松点!”他一边喊着，一边把他拉了回来。

McGinty released his hold, and Baldwin, cowed and shaken gasping for breath, and shivering in every limb, as one who has looked over the very edge of death, sat up on the barrel over which he had been hurled.

麦克金蒂松开了手，鲍德温吓得直哆嗦，喘不过气来，四肢发抖，就像一个刚刚经历过死亡边缘的人，坐在被扔过去的桶上。

“You've been asking for it this many a day, Ted Baldwin—now you've got it!” cried McGinty, his huge chest rising and falling. “Maybe you think if I was voted down from Bodymaster you would find yourself in my shoes. It's for the lodge to say that. But so long as I am the chief I'll have no man lift his voice against me or my rulings.”

“泰德 · 鲍德温，你已经要求了这么多天了——现在你得到了!”麦金蒂喊道，他那巨大的胸膛上下起伏。“也许你认为，如果我被健美大师(Bodymaster)否决，你会发现自己处在我的位置上。这应该由旅馆来说。但是，只要我还是酋长，就不会有人对我和我的裁决提出异议。”

“I have nothing against you,” mumbled Baldwin, feeling his throat.

“我并不反对你,”鲍德温摸着他的喉咙咕哝着。

“Well, then,” cried the other, relapsing in a moment into a bluff joviality, “we are all good friends again and there's an end of the matter.”

“好吧，那么,”另一个叫道，一会儿又变得欢快起来，虚张声势，“我们又都是好朋友了，这件事到此为止了。”

He took a bottle of champagne down from the shelf and twisted out the cork.

他从架子上取下一瓶香槟酒，拧开软木塞。

“See now,” he continued, as he filled three high glasses. “Let us drink the quarrelling toast of the lodge. After that, as you know, there can be no bad blood between us. Now, then the left hand on the apple of my throat. I say to you, Ted Baldwin, what is the offense, sir?”

“现在看看,”他接着说，同时倒满了三个高脚杯。“让我们喝一杯小屋争吵的祝酒词吧。在那之后，如你所知，我们之间不会有什么过节。现在，然后左手放在我喉咙的苹果上。我跟你说，泰德 · 鲍德温，你犯了什么罪，先生?”

“The clouds are heavy,” answered Baldwin.

“乌云密布,”鲍德温回答。

“But they will forever brighten.”

“但它们将永远闪亮。”

“And this I swear!”

“我发誓!”

The men drank their glasses, and the same ceremony was performed between Baldwin and McMurdo

男人们喝了他们的杯子，同样的仪式在 Baldwin 和麦克默多站之间举行

“There!” cried McGinty, rubbing his hands. “That's the end of the black blood. You come under lodge discipline if it goes further, and that's a heavy hand in these parts, as Brother Baldwin knows—and as you will damn soon find out, Brother McMurdo, if you ask for trouble!”

“那儿!”麦金蒂搓着双手喊道。“这就是黑血的终结。如果走得更远，你就会受到洛奇的惩罚。鲍德温修士知道，在这些地方，这是一种沉重的手段——你很快就会发现，麦克默多修士，如果你自找麻烦!”

“Faith, I'd be slow to do that,” said McMurdo. He held out his hand to Baldwin. “I'm quick to quarrel and quick to forgive. It's my hot Irish blood, they tell me. But it's over for me, and I bear no grudge.”

“信不信由你，我会慢慢来的,”麦克默多站说。他向鲍德温伸出手。“我很容易吵架，也很容易原谅。他们告诉我，这是我热情的爱尔兰血统。但对我来说已经结束了，我没有怨恨。”

Baldwin had to take the proffered hand, for the baleful eye of the terrible Boss was upon him. But his sullen face showed how little the words of the other had moved him.

鲍德温不得不握住他伸出的手，因为那个可怕的首领的恶毒的眼睛盯着他。但是他阴沉的脸上显示出对方的话对他没有多大影响。

McGinty clapped them both on the shoulders. “Tut! These girls! These girls!” he cried. “To think that the same petticoats should come between two of my boys! It's the devil's own luck! Well, it's the colleen inside of them that must settle the question for it's outside the jurisdiction of a Bodymaster—and the Lord be praised for that! We have enough on us, without the women as well. You'll have to be affiliated to Lodge 341, Brother McMurdo. We have our own ways and methods, different from Chicago. Saturday night is our meeting, and if you come then, we'll make you free forever of the Vermissa Valley.”

麦金蒂拍了拍他们俩的肩膀。“啧！这些女孩！这些女孩!”他哭了起来。“想想看，我的两个儿子竟然穿着同样的衬裙！这是魔鬼自己的运气！好吧，这个问题必须由她们体内的 colleen 来解决，因为这不在身体大师的管辖范围之内ーー这是值得赞美的！我们有足够的证据，而且没有女人。你必须加入洛奇341，麦克默多兄弟。我们有自己的方式和方法，不同于芝加哥。星期六晚上是我们的聚会，如果你到时候来，我们就让你永远离开维尔米萨山谷。”
