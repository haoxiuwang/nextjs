“I am inclined to think—” said I.

“我倾向于认为——”我说。

“I should do so,” Sherlock Holmes remarked impatiently.

“我应该这么做,”夏洛克 · 福尔摩斯不耐烦地说。

I believe that I am one of the most long-suffering of mortals; but I'll admit that I was annoyed at the sardonic interruption.

我相信我是世界上最能忍受痛苦的人之一，但我得承认，我对这种讥讽的打断感到恼火。

“Really, Holmes,” said I severely, “you are a little trying at times.”

“说真的，福尔摩斯,”我严肃地说，“你有时候确实有点难缠。”

He was too much absorbed with his own thoughts to give any immediate answer to my remonstrance. He leaned upon his hand, with his untasted breakfast before him, and he stared at the slip of paper which he had just drawn from its envelope. Then he took the envelope itself, held it up to the light, and very carefully studied both the exterior and the flap.

他太专注于自己的思想，不能对我的劝告立即作出回答。他倚在手上，面前摆着他从未尝过的早餐，他盯着刚从信封里抽出来的那张纸条。然后他拿起信封，把它对着灯光，非常仔细地研究了信封的外观和信封口盖。

“It is Porlock's writing,” said he thoughtfully. “I can hardly doubt that it is Porlock's writing, though I have seen it only twice before. The Greek e with the peculiar top flourish is distinctive. But if it is Porlock, then it must be something of the very first importance.”

“这是波洛克的作品,”他若有所思地说。“我几乎不能怀疑这是波洛克的作品，尽管我以前只看过两次。顶部花纹特殊的希腊字母 e 很有特色。但如果是波洛克，那么它肯定是头等大事。”

He was speaking to himself rather than to me; but my vexation disappeared in the interest which the words awakened.

他是在对自己说话，而不是对我说话; 但是我的烦恼消失在这些话引起的兴趣中了。

“Who then is Porlock?” I asked.

“那么谁是波洛克?”我问。

“Porlock, Watson, is a nom-de-plume, a mere identification mark; but behind it lies a shifty and evasive personality. In a former letter he frankly informed me that the name was not his own, and defied me ever to trace him among the teeming millions of this great city. Porlock is important, not for himself, but for the great man with whom he is in touch. Picture to yourself the pilot fish with the shark, the jackal with the lion—anything that is insignificant in companionship with what is formidable: not only formidable, Watson, but sinister—in the highest degree sinister. That is where he comes within my purview. You have heard me speak of Professor Moriarty?”

“沃森，波洛克是一个笔名，仅仅是一个身份标记; 但是在它的背后隐藏着一个狡猾和逃避的人格。在以前的一封信中，他坦率地告诉我，这个名字不是他自己的，并且激怒了我，让我在这个伟大的城市的千百万人中找不到他的踪迹。波洛克很重要，不是为了他自己，而是为了与他保持联系的伟人。想象一下，领航鱼和鲨鱼在一起，豺鱼和狮子在一起ーー任何与令人生畏的东西相伴的东西都是微不足道的: 不仅令人生畏，华生，而且是最险恶的。这就是他在我职权范围内的地方。你听我说过詹姆斯·莫里亚蒂教授吗?”

“The famous scientific criminal, as famous among crooks as—”

”著名的科学罪犯，在骗子中像...”

“My blushes, Watson!” Holmes murmured in a deprecating voice.

“我的脸红了，华生!”福尔摩斯用一种嘲讽的声音低声说。

“I was about to say, as he is unknown to the public.”

“我正要说，因为公众对他一无所知。”

“A touch! A distinct touch!” cried Holmes. “You are developing a certain unexpected vein of pawky humour, Watson, against which I must learn to guard myself. But in calling Moriarty a criminal you are uttering libel in the eyes of the law—and there lie the glory and the wonder of it! The greatest schemer of all time, the organizer of every deviltry, the controlling brain of the underworld, a brain which might have made or marred the destiny of nations—that's the man! But so aloof is he from general suspicion, so immune from criticism, so admirable in his management and self-effacement, that for those very words that you have uttered he could hale you to a court and emerge with your year's pension as a solatium for his wounded character. Is he not the celebrated author of The Dynamics of an Asteroid, a book which ascends to such rarefied heights of pure mathematics that it is said that there was no man in the scientific press capable of criticizing it? Is this a man to traduce? Foul-mouthed doctor and slandered professor—such would be your respective roles! That's genius, Watson. But if I am spared by lesser men, our day will surely come.”

“摸一下！一种独特的触感!”福尔摩斯叫道。“华生，你正在发展出一种出人意料的顽皮幽默，我必须学会防范这种幽默。但从法律的角度来看，称莫里亚蒂为罪犯等于诽谤——这就是莫里亚蒂的光荣和奇迹！有史以来最伟大的阴谋家，每一次恶行的组织者，地下世界的控制者，一个可能决定或破坏国家命运的大脑ーー这就是那个人！但是他是如此的远离一般的怀疑，如此的不受批评，如此的令人钦佩他的管理和自我谦逊，以至于你说的那些话可以把你带到法庭上，然后拿着你一年的养老金去抚慰他受伤的性格。他不是著名的小行星动力学的作者吗? 这本书将纯数学提升到如此高的高度，据说科学出版界没有人能够批评它？这是一个中伤的人吗？满口脏话的医生和诽谤的教授——这就是你们各自的角色！真是天才，华生。但是，如果我不受那些人的伤害，我们的时代一定会到来。”

“May I be there to see!” I exclaimed devoutly. “But you were speaking of this man Porlock.”

“我可以到那儿去看看吗?”我虔诚地喊道，“但你说的是波洛克这个人。”

“Ah, yes—the so-called Porlock is a link in the chain some little way from its great attachment. Porlock is not quite a sound link—between ourselves. He is the only flaw in that chain so far as I have been able to test it.”

“啊，是的ーー所谓的波洛克是链条中的一环，离它的大附件只有一点点距离。波洛克并不完全是我们之间的良好联系。据我所知，他是这个链条上唯一的缺陷。”

“But no chain is stronger than its weakest link.”

“但没有哪条链条比它最薄弱的一环更牢固。”

“Exactly, my dear Watson! Hence the extreme importance of Porlock. Led on by some rudimentary aspirations towards right, and encouraged by the judicious stimulation of an occasional ten-pound note sent to him by devious methods, he has once or twice given me advance information which has been of value—that highest value which anticipates and prevents rather than avenges crime. I cannot doubt that, if we had the cipher, we should find that this communication is of the nature that I indicate.”

“没错，我亲爱的华生！因此，波洛克的极端重要性。在对正义的一些基本渴望的引导下，在以不正当手段偶尔寄给他一张10英镑纸币的明智刺激下，他有一两次预先告诉了我一些有价值的信息——这些信息最有价值，可以预见和预防而不是报复犯罪。我不能怀疑，如果我们有了密码，我们就会发现这种通信是我所指出的那种性质。”

Again Holmes flattened out the paper upon his unused plate. I rose and, leaning over him, stared down at the curious inscription, which ran as follows:

福尔摩斯又把那张纸摊平在他没用过的盘子上。我站起身来，俯身在他身上，低头看着那奇怪的题字，它是这样写的:

534 C2 13 127 36 31 4 17 21 41

534 c21312736314172141

DOUGLAS 109 293 5 37 BIRLSTONE

109293537 BIRLSTONE

26 BIRLSTONE 9 47 171

26 BIRLSTONE 947171

“What do you make of it, Holmes?”

“你怎么看，福尔摩斯?”

“It is obviously an attempt to convey secret information.”

“这显然是试图传达秘密信息。”

“But what is the use of a cipher message without the cipher?”

“但是没有密码，密码信息又有什么用呢?”

“In this instance, none at all.”

“在这种情况下，完全没有。”

“Why do you say ‘in this instance’?”

“你为什么说‘在这种情况下’?”

“Because there are many ciphers which I would read as easily as I do the apocrypha of the agony column: such crude devices amuse the intelligence without fatiguing it. But this is different. It is clearly a reference to the words in a page of some book. Until I am told which page and which book I am powerless.”

“因为有许多密码，我读起来就像读读读读读心理咨询专栏的伪经一样容易: 这种粗糙的玩意儿逗聪明人开心，却不会使它感到疲惫。但这次不同。这显然是某本书某一页上的话的参考。直到有人告诉我哪一页哪一本书，我才能知道我是无能为力的。”

“But why ‘Douglas’ and ‘Birlstone’?”

“但为什么是‘道格拉斯’和‘伯尔斯通’呢?”

“Clearly because those are words which were not contained in the page in question.”

“很明显，因为这些文字没有包含在有关的页面中。”

“Then why has he not indicated the book?”

“那么他为什么没有指出那本书?”

“Your native shrewdness, my dear Watson, that innate cunning which is the delight of your friends, would surely prevent you from inclosing cipher and message in the same envelope. Should it miscarry, you are undone. As it is, both have to go wrong before any harm comes from it. Our second post is now overdue, and I shall be surprised if it does not bring us either a further letter of explanation, or, as is more probable, the very volume to which these figures refer.”

“你天生的精明，我亲爱的华生，你的朋友们天生的那种狡猾，一定会阻止你把密码和信件放在同一个信封里。如果它流产了，你就完蛋了。事实上，在它造成任何伤害之前，两者都必须出错。我们的第二封邮件现在已经过期，如果它既没有给我们带来进一步的解释信，也没有给我们带来这些数字所涉及的更有可能的数量，我将感到惊讶。”

Holmes's calculation was fulfilled within a very few minutes by the appearance of Billy, the page, with the very letter which we were expecting.

福尔摩斯的计算在几分钟之内就完成了，比利出现了，那页纸上，正是我们所期待的那封信。

“The same writing,” remarked Holmes, as he opened the envelope, “and actually signed,” he added in an exultant voice as he unfolded the epistle. “Come, we are getting on, Watson.” His brow clouded, however, as he glanced over the contents.

“同样的字迹,”福尔摩斯打开信封时说，“而且确实签了名,”他一边打开信，一边兴高采烈地补充道。“来吧，我们继续前进，华生。”然而，当他扫视一下里面的内容时，他的眉毛却阴沉了下来。

“Dear me, this is very disappointing! I fear, Watson, that all our expectations come to nothing. I trust that the man Porlock will come to no harm.

“天哪，这太令人失望了！我担心，华生，我们所有的期望都会落空。我相信波洛克不会受到伤害。

“Dear Mr. Holmes [he says]:

“亲爱的福尔摩斯先生(他说) :

“I will go no further in this matter. It is too dangerous—he suspects me. I can see that he suspects me. He came to me quite unexpectedly after I had actually addressed this envelope with the intention of sending you the key to the cipher. I was able to cover it up. If he had seen it, it would have gone hard with me. But I read suspicion in his eyes. Please burn the cipher message, which can now be of no use to you.

“在这件事情上，我不会再往前走了。太危险了ーー他怀疑我。我看得出他怀疑我。在我给这个信封写好地址，打算把密钥寄给你之后，他出乎意料地来找我。我把它掩盖了起来。如果他看到了，我会很难过的。但我从他的眼神中看出了怀疑。请烧掉这封现在对你没有用处的密文。

“Fred Porlock.”

”弗雷德 · 波洛克”

Holmes sat for some little time twisting this letter between his fingers, and frowning, as he stared into the fire.

福尔摩斯坐了一会儿，把这封信夹在手指间，皱着眉头，凝视着炉火。

“After all,” he said at last, “there may be nothing in it. It may be only his guilty conscience. Knowing himself to be a traitor, he may have read the accusation in the other's eyes.”

“毕竟,”他最后说，“里面可能什么也没有。可能只是他的内疚。他知道自己是个叛徒，也许已经从对方的眼睛里看到了指责。”

“The other being, I presume, Professor Moriarty.”

“我猜，另一个就是詹姆斯·莫里亚蒂教授。”

“No less! When any of that party talk about ‘He’ you know whom they mean. There is one predominant ‘He’ for all of them.”

”“一点也不差！当任何一个政党谈论“他”的时候，你知道他们指的是谁。对于所有人来说，都有一个占主导地位的‘他’。”

“But what can he do?”

“但他能做什么呢?”

“Hum! That's a large question. When you have one of the first brains of Europe up against you, and all the powers of darkness at his back, there are infinite possibilities. Anyhow, Friend Porlock is evidently scared out of his senses—kindly compare the writing in the note to that upon its envelope; which was done, he tells us, before this ill-omened visit. The one is clear and firm. The other hardly legible.”

“哼！这是一个很大的问题。当你有欧洲最早的智者之一来对抗你，而所有的黑暗力量都在背后支持你，那就会有无限的可能性。不管怎样，波洛克朋友显然是吓得失去理智了ーー他亲切地把便条上的字迹和信封上的字迹作了比较，他告诉我们，这是在这次不吉利的拜访之前写的。一个是清晰而坚定的。另一张几乎看不清楚。”

“Why did he write at all? Why did he not simply drop it?”

“他到底为什么要写信? 为什么他不干脆放弃呢?”

“Because he feared I would make some inquiry after him in that case, and possibly bring trouble on him.”

“因为他怕我在那种情况下追问他，可能会给他带来麻烦。”

“No doubt,” said I. “Of course.” I had picked up the original cipher message and was bending my brows over it. “It's pretty maddening to think that an important secret may lie here on this slip of paper, and that it is beyond human power to penetrate it.”

“毫无疑问,”我说，“当然。”我捡起了原始的密码信息，正在低头看着它。“一想到一个重要的秘密可能就在这张纸上，而且超出了人类的力量去发现它，就令人发狂。”

Sherlock Holmes had pushed away his untasted breakfast and lit the unsavoury pipe which was the companion of his deepest meditations. “I wonder!” said he, leaning back and staring at the ceiling. “Perhaps there are points which have escaped your Machiavellian intellect. Let us consider the problem in the light of pure reason. This man's reference is to a book. That is our point of departure.”

夏洛克 · 福尔摩斯推开了他那难吃的早餐，点燃了那根难闻的烟斗，这是他沉思冥想的伴侣。“我想知道!”他说，向后靠着，盯着天花板。“也许有些地方逃脱了你们马基雅维利式的智慧。让我们从纯粹理性的角度来考虑这个问题。这个人引用的是一本书。这就是我们的出发点。”

“A somewhat vague one.”

“有点模糊。”

“Let us see then if we can narrow it down. As I focus my mind upon it, it seems rather less impenetrable. What indications have we as to this book?”

“让我们看看能否缩小范围。当我把注意力集中在它上面时，它看起来就不那么难以理解了。我们对这本书有什么看法?”

“None.”

“没有。”

“Well, well, it is surely not quite so bad as that. The cipher message begins with a large 534, does it not? We may take it as a working hypothesis that 534 is the particular page to which the cipher refers. So our book has already become a large book which is surely something gained. What other indications have we as to the nature of this large book? The next sign is C2. What do you make of that, Watson?”

”“好吧，好吧，肯定没有那么糟糕。这个密码信息是以一个大的534开头的，对吗？我们可以把它作为一个有效的假设，即534是密码所指的特定页面。因此，我们的书已经成为一本大书，肯定有所收获。关于这本大书的性质，我们还有什么其他的迹象吗？下一个征兆是 C2。你怎么看，华生?”

“Chapter the second, no doubt.”

“第二章，毫无疑问。”

“Hardly that, Watson. You will, I am sure, agree with me that if the page be given, the number of the chapter is immaterial. Also that if page 534 finds us only in the second chapter, the length of the first one must have been really intolerable.”

“不是那样的，华生。我相信，你会同意我的看法，即如果给出这一页，那一章的编号是无关紧要的。而且，如果第534页只在第二章找到我们，那么第一章的长度一定是真的无法忍受的。”

“Column!” I cried.

“柱子!”我喊道。

“Brilliant, Watson. You are scintillating this morning. If it is not column, then I am very much deceived. So now, you see, we begin to visualize a large book printed in double columns which are each of a considerable length, since one of the words is numbered in the document as the two hundred and ninety-third. Have we reached the limits of what reason can supply?”

“好极了，华生。你今天上午真是才华横溢。如果不是专栏，那我就大错特错了。所以现在，你看，我们开始想象一本大书，印在两栏里，每栏都很长，因为文件中的一个单词是293。我们是否已经达到了理性所能提供的极限?”

“I fear that we have.”

“我担心我们已经这样做了。”

“Surely you do yourself an injustice. One more coruscation, my dear Watson—yet another brain-wave! Had the volume been an unusual one, he would have sent it to me. Instead of that, he had intended, before his plans were nipped, to send me the clue in this envelope. He says so in his note. This would seem to indicate that the book is one which he thought I would have no difficulty in finding for myself. He had it—and he imagined that I would have it, too. In short, Watson, it is a very common book.”

”“你当然对自己不公平。我亲爱的华生，再来一次闪光——再来一次脑电波！如果那本书是不同寻常的，他会寄给我的。相反，在他的计划被扼杀之前，他打算把这个信封里的线索寄给我。他在便条上是这么说的。这似乎表明这本书是他认为我会毫不费力地为自己找到的书。他得了这个病，他想我也会得这个病。简而言之，华生，这是一本非常普通的书。”

“What you say certainly sounds plausible.”

“你说的话听起来确实有道理。”

“So we have contracted our field of search to a large book, printed in double columns and in common use.”

“因此，我们把搜索领域缩小到一本大书上，这本书以双栏形式印刷，通用性很强。”

“The Bible!” I cried triumphantly.

“圣经!”我得意洋洋地喊道。

“Good, Watson, good! But not, if I may say so, quite good enough! Even if I accepted the compliment for myself I could hardly name any volume which would be less likely to lie at the elbow of one of Moriarty's associates. Besides, the editions of Holy Writ are so numerous that he could hardly suppose that two copies would have the same pagination. This is clearly a book which is standardized. He knows for certain that his page 534 will exactly agree with my page 534.”

“好，华生，好！但是，如果我可以这么说的话，还不够好！即使我自己接受了这个赞美，我也很难说出哪本书不会放在莫里亚蒂的一个同伙的身边。此外，由于《圣经》的版本太多，他很难想象两个版本会有同样的分页。这显然是一本标准化的书。他肯定知道他的第534页与我的第534页完全一致。”

“But very few books would correspond with that.”

“但很少有书能与之相符。”

“Exactly. Therein lies our salvation. Our search is narrowed down to standardized books which anyone may be supposed to possess.”

“没错。这就是我们的救赎。我们的搜索范围缩小到任何人都可能拥有的标准化书籍。”

“Bradshaw!”

“布拉德肖!”

“There are difficulties, Watson. The vocabulary of Bradshaw is nervous and terse, but limited. The selection of words would hardly lend itself to the sending of general messages. We will eliminate Bradshaw. The dictionary is, I fear, inadmissible for the same reason. What then is left?”

“有困难，华生。布拉德肖的词汇紧张而简洁，但有限。词语的选择不利于一般信息的发送。我们要消灭布拉德肖。我担心，出于同样的原因，这本词典是不能被采纳的。那还剩下什么?”

“An almanac!”

“年鉴!”

“Excellent, Watson! I am very much mistaken if you have not touched the spot. An almanac! Let us consider the claims of Whitaker's Almanac. It is in common use. It has the requisite number of pages. It is in double column. Though reserved in its earlier vocabulary, it becomes, if I remember right, quite garrulous towards the end.” He picked the volume from his desk. “Here is page 534, column two, a substantial block of print dealing, I perceive, with the trade and resources of British India. Jot down the words, Watson! Number thirteen is ‘Mahratta.’ Not, I fear, a very auspicious beginning. Number one hundred and twenty-seven is ‘Government’; which at least makes sense, though somewhat irrelevant to ourselves and Professor Moriarty. Now let us try again. What does the Mahratta government do? Alas! the next word is ‘pig's-bristles.’ We are undone, my good Watson! It is finished!”

“好极了，华生！如果你没有碰到那个地方，我就大错特错了。年鉴！让我们来看看惠特克的年鉴。这是常用的。它有必要的页数。它是双列的。虽然在它早期的词汇中有所保留，但如果我没记错的话，到最后它变得相当啰嗦。”他从书桌上拿起那本书。“这是第534页第二栏，据我所知，有大量印刷品涉及英属印度的贸易和资源。快速记下单词，华生！第十三个是“ Mahratta”。”“恐怕不是什么好兆头。排在第一百二十七位的是‘政府’，这至少是有道理的，尽管与我们自己和詹姆斯·莫里亚蒂教授无关。现在让我们再试一次。马赫拉塔政府是做什么的？唉！下一个词是猪鬃。我们完蛋了，我的好华生！结束了!”

He had spoken in jesting vein, but the twitching of his bushy eyebrows bespoke his disappointment and irritation. I sat helpless and unhappy, staring into the fire. A long silence was broken by a sudden exclamation from Holmes, who dashed at a cupboard, from which he emerged with a second yellow-covered volume in his hand.

他说话的口气是开玩笑的，但他浓密的眉毛的抽动显示出他的失望和恼怒。我无助地坐着，闷闷不乐地盯着炉火。福尔摩斯突然发出一声惊叫，打破了长时间的沉默。他冲向一个橱柜，从那里出来，手里拿着第二本黄色的书。

“We pay the price, Watson, for being too up-to-date!” he cried. “We are before our time, and suffer the usual penalties. Being the seventh of January, we have very properly laid in the new almanac. It is more than likely that Porlock took his message from the old one. No doubt he would have told us so had his letter of explanation been written. Now let us see what page 534 has in store for us. Number thirteen is ‘There,’ which is much more promising. Number one hundred and twenty-seven is ‘is’—‘There is’”—Holmes's eyes were gleaming with excitement, and his thin, nervous fingers twitched as he counted the words—“‘danger.’ Ha! Ha! Capital! Put that down, Watson. ‘There is danger—may—come—very—soon—one.’ Then we have the name ‘Douglas’—‘rich—country—now—at—Birlstone—House—Birlstone—confidence—is—pressing.’ There, Watson! What do you think of pure reason and its fruit? If the greengrocer had such a thing as a laurel wreath, I should send Billy round for it.”

“华生，我们要为过于时髦而付出代价!”他哭了起来。“我们来得太早了，遭受着通常的惩罚。今天是一月七日，我们在新的年鉴上写得很恰当。波洛克很有可能是从旧的那条信息中得到启示的。毫无疑问，如果他写了解释信的话，他会告诉我们的。现在让我们看看第534页为我们准备了什么。第十三个是 There，这个更有希望。第一百二十七个字是“ is”ーー“ There is”ーー福尔摩斯的眼睛里闪烁着兴奋的光芒，他那纤细而紧张的手指在数“危险”这几个字的时候抽搐着哈！哈！好极了！把那个放下，华生。“有危险ーー可能ーー很快ーー来临ーー一个。然后我们有了“道格拉斯”这个名字ーー“富裕的国家ーー现在在伯尔斯通ーー房子ーー伯尔斯通ーー信心正在紧迫。”。“好了，华生！你如何看待纯粹理性及其果实？如果蔬菜水果商有月桂花环这样的东西，我应该叫比利过来买。”

I was staring at the strange message which I had scrawled, as he deciphered it, upon a sheet of foolscap on my knee.

我盯着我在膝盖上的一张大页纸上潦草地写下的奇怪信息，他正在破译。

“What a queer, scrambling way of expressing his meaning!” said I.

“他的意思表达方式真是奇怪，乱七八糟!”我说。

“On the contrary, he has done quite remarkably well,” said Holmes. “When you search a single column for words with which to express your meaning, you can hardly expect to get everything you want. You are bound to leave something to the intelligence of your correspondent. The purport is perfectly clear. Some deviltry is intended against one Douglas, whoever he may be, residing as stated, a rich country gentleman. He is sure—‘confidence’ was as near as he could get to ‘confident’—that it is pressing. There is our result—and a very workmanlike little bit of analysis it was!”

“恰恰相反，他做得相当不错,”福尔摩斯说。“当你在一个专栏中搜索用来表达意思的单词时，你很难指望得到你想要的一切。你肯定会把一些事情留给你的通讯员去做。其主旨非常明确。有些恶行是针对一个道格拉斯的，不管他是谁，住在上面所说的那个富有的乡下绅士。他确信，“自信”是他所能达到的最接近“自信”的程度，这是一个迫切的问题。这就是我们的结果——而且是一个非常巧妙的小分析!”

Holmes had the impersonal joy of the true artist in his better work, even as he mourned darkly when it fell below the high level to which he aspired. He was still chuckling over his success when Billy swung open the door and Inspector MacDonald of Scotland Yard was ushered into the room.

在他更好的作品中，福尔摩斯拥有真正艺术家那种毫无个人情感的喜悦，即使当这种喜悦低于他所向往的高度时，他依然悲伤。当比利打开门，苏格兰场的督察麦克唐纳被引进房间时，他还在暗自窃笑自己的成功。

Those were the early days at the end of the '80's, when Alec MacDonald was far from having attained the national fame which he has now achieved. He was a young but trusted member of the detective force, who had distinguished himself in several cases which had been entrusted to him. His tall, bony figure gave promise of exceptional physical strength, while his great cranium and deep-set, lustrous eyes spoke no less clearly of the keen intelligence which twinkled out from behind his bushy eyebrows. He was a silent, precise man with a dour nature and a hard Aberdonian accent.

那是80年代末的早期，当时亚历克 · 麦克唐纳还远远没有达到他现在已经达到的全国知名度。他是侦探队中一个年轻但值得信赖的成员，在几个交给他处理的案件中都有杰出的表现。他身材高大，骨瘦如柴，有着非凡的体力，而他那巨大的头盖骨和深陷的、明亮的眼睛也同样清楚地表明了他浓密的眉毛后面闪烁着的敏锐的智慧。他是一个沉默寡言、一丝不苟的人，性格阴沉，带着阿伯多尼亚人的口音。

Twice already in his career had Holmes helped him to attain success, his own sole reward being the intellectual joy of the problem. For this reason the affection and respect of the Scotchman for his amateur colleague were profound, and he showed them by the frankness with which he consulted Holmes in every difficulty. Mediocrity knows nothing higher than itself; but talent instantly recognizes genius, and MacDonald had talent enough for his profession to enable him to perceive that there was no humiliation in seeking the assistance of one who already stood alone in Europe, both in his gifts and in his experience. Holmes was not prone to friendship, but he was tolerant of the big Scotchman, and smiled at the sight of him.

在他的职业生涯中，福尔摩斯已经两次帮助他获得成功，他自己唯一的回报就是对这个问题的智力上的快乐。由于这个原因，苏格兰人对他的业余同事的感情和尊敬是深刻的，他在每一个困难的问题上向福尔摩斯请教时都表现出坦率的态度。庸才知道没有什么比它自己更高的了; 但是天才能够立刻识别出天才，而麦克唐纳有足够的天赋使他能够意识到，寻求一个在欧洲已经独自站立的人的帮助，无论是在他的天赋还是在他的经验方面，都没有什么可耻的。福尔摩斯不善于交朋友，但他对那个高大的苏格兰人很宽容，一见到他就笑了。

“You are an early bird, Mr. Mac,” said he. “I wish you luck with your worm. I fear this means that there is some mischief afoot.”

“麦克先生，你真是个早起的鸟儿。”他说。“祝你的虫子好运。我担心这意味着有人在搞恶作剧。”

“If you said ‘hope’ instead of ‘fear,’ it would be nearer the truth, I'm thinking, Mr. Holmes,” the inspector answered, with a knowing grin. “Well, maybe a wee nip would keep out the raw morning chill. No, I won't smoke, I thank you. I'll have to be pushing on my way; for the early hours of a case are the precious ones, as no man knows better than your own self. But—but—”

“我在想，如果你说的是‘希望’而不是‘恐惧’，那就更接近事实了，福尔摩斯先生,”侦察员会意地笑着回答。“好吧，也许喝一小口就能抵挡清晨的寒意。不，我不抽烟，谢谢。我得继续赶路了，因为案件的最初几个小时是宝贵的，因为没有人比你自己更清楚。但是ーー但是ーー”

The inspector had stopped suddenly, and was staring with a look of absolute amazement at a paper upon the table. It was the sheet upon which I had scrawled the enigmatic message.

检查员突然停了下来，惊愕地盯着桌上的一张纸。我就是在这张纸上潦草地写下了这条神秘的信息。

“Douglas!” he stammered. “Birlstone! What's this, Mr. Holmes? Man, it's witchcraft! Where in the name of all that is wonderful did you get those names?”

“道格拉斯!”他结结巴巴地说。“伯尔斯通！这是什么，福尔摩斯先生？伙计，这是巫术！这些名字究竟是从哪儿来的?”

“It is a cipher that Dr. Watson and I have had occasion to solve. But why—what's amiss with the names?”

“这是一个我和华生医生有机会解开的密码。但是为什么——这些名字有什么不对吗?”

The inspector looked from one to the other of us in dazed astonishment. “Just this,” said he, “that Mr. Douglas of Birlstone Manor House was horribly murdered last night!”

巡查员茫然地惊讶地从一个人看向另一个人。“就是这样,”他说，“伯斯通庄园的道格拉斯先生昨晚被残忍地谋杀了!”
