“Have you seen all you want of the study?” asked White Mason as we reentered the house.

当我们再次走进房子时，怀特 · 梅森问道: “你们看到你们想要的书房了吗?”。

“For the time,” said the inspector, and Holmes nodded.

“暂时的,”侦察员说，福尔摩斯点点头。

“Then perhaps you would now like to hear the evidence of some of the people in the house. We could use the dining-room, Ames. Please come yourself first and tell us what you know.”

”“那么，也许你现在想听听屋子里一些人的证词。我们可以用餐厅，艾姆斯。请先告诉我们你所知道的一切。”

The butler's account was a simple and a clear one, and he gave a convincing impression of sincerity. He had been engaged five years before, when Douglas first came to Birlstone. He understood that Mr. Douglas was a rich gentleman who had made his money in America. He had been a kind and considerate employer—not quite what Ames was used to, perhaps; but one can't have everything. He never saw any signs of apprehension in Mr. Douglas: on the contrary, he was the most fearless man he had ever known. He ordered the drawbridge to be pulled up every night because it was the ancient custom of the old house, and he liked to keep the old ways up.

男管家的叙述简单明了，给人的印象是真诚的。5年前，道格拉斯第一次来到 Birlstone 时，他已经订婚。他知道道格拉斯先生是个有钱的绅士，在美国发了财。他曾经是一个和蔼可亲、体贴入微的雇主ーー也许不像艾姆斯以前那样习惯了; 但是人不可能拥有一切。他从道格拉斯先生身上看不出任何忧虑的迹象，恰恰相反，他是他所知道的最无畏的人。他命令每天晚上拉起吊桥，因为这是老房子的古老习俗，而且他喜欢保留旧的方式。

Mr. Douglas seldom went to London or left the village; but on the day before the crime he had been shopping at Tunbridge Wells. He (Ames) had observed some restlessness and excitement on the part of Mr. Douglas that day; for he had seemed impatient and irritable, which was unusual with him. He had not gone to bed that night; but was in the pantry at the back of the house, putting away the silver, when he heard the bell ring violently. He heard no shot; but it was hardly possible he would, as the pantry and kitchens were at the very back of the house and there were several closed doors and a long passage between. The housekeeper had come out of her room, attracted by the violent ringing of the bell. They had gone to the front of the house together.

道格拉斯先生很少去伦敦或离开村子，但在案发前一天他在 Tunbridge Wells 购物。那天他(艾姆斯)注意到道格拉斯先生有些坐立不安和激动，因为他看上去急躁易怒，这在他身上是不寻常的。那天晚上他还没有上床睡觉，正在屋子后面的储藏室里收拾银器的时候，突然听到门铃剧烈地响了起来。他没有听到枪声，但是他几乎不可能听到枪声，因为食品室和厨房在房子的最后面，有几扇紧闭的门和一条长长的通道。女管家已经走出她的房间，被猛烈的铃声所吸引。他们一起到房子前面去了。

As they reached the bottom of the stair he had seen Mrs. Douglas coming down it. No, she was not hurrying; it did not seem to him that she was particularly agitated. Just as she reached the bottom of the stair Mr. Barker had rushed out of the study. He had stopped Mrs. Douglas and begged her to go back.

当他们走到楼梯底部时，他看见道格拉斯太太从楼梯上走下来。不，她并没有急急忙忙，他看不出她特别激动。就在她走到楼梯底部的时候，巴克先生冲出了书房。他拦住了道格拉斯太太，恳求她回去。

“For God's sake, go back to your room!” he cried. “Poor Jack is dead! You can do nothing. For God's sake, go back!”

“看在上帝的份上，回你的房间去!”他哭了起来。“可怜的杰克死了！你什么也做不了。看在上帝的份上，回去吧!”

After some persuasion upon the stairs Mrs. Douglas had gone back. She did not scream. She made no outcry whatever. Mrs. Allen, the housekeeper, had taken her upstairs and stayed with her in the bedroom. Ames and Mr. Barker had then returned to the study, where they had found everything exactly as the police had seen it. The candle was not lit at that time; but the lamp was burning. They had looked out of the window; but the night was very dark and nothing could be seen or heard. They had then rushed out into the hall, where Ames had turned the windlass which lowered the drawbridge. Mr. Barker had then hurried off to get the police.

经过在楼梯上的一番劝说，道格拉斯太太回去了。她没有尖叫。她没有发出任何抗议。管家艾伦太太把她带到楼上，留在卧室里陪她。埃姆斯和巴克先生随后回到书房，在那里他们发现的一切都和警察看到的一模一样。那时蜡烛还没有点着，但是灯还在点着。他们向窗外望去，但那天晚上很黑，什么也看不见，什么也听不见。然后他们冲进了大厅，艾姆斯在那里转动了绞车，降低了吊桥的高度。于是巴克先生匆匆忙忙地去找警察。

Such, in its essentials, was the evidence of the butler.

就其本质而言，这就是管家的证据。

The account of Mrs. Allen, the housekeeper, was, so far as it went, a corroboration of that of her fellow servant. The housekeeper's room was rather nearer to the front of the house than the pantry in which Ames had been working. She was preparing to go to bed when the loud ringing of the bell had attracted her attention. She was a little hard of hearing. Perhaps that was why she had not heard the shot; but in any case the study was a long way off. She remembered hearing some sound which she imagined to be the slamming of a door. That was a good deal earlier—half an hour at least before the ringing of the bell. When Mr. Ames ran to the front she went with him. She saw Mr. Barker, very pale and excited, come out of the study. He intercepted Mrs. Douglas, who was coming down the stairs. He entreated her to go back, and she answered him, but what she said could not be heard.

管家艾伦太太的叙述，到目前为止，是她的同事的证实。管家的房间比艾姆斯工作的餐具室更靠近房子的前面。她正准备上床睡觉，这时响亮的铃声引起了她的注意。她有点耳背。也许这就是她没有听到枪声的原因，但无论如何，这项研究还有很长的路要走。她记得听到了一些声音，她想象是砰地一声关上门。这在早些时候是一笔不错的交易，至少是在铃声响起之前的半小时。当艾姆斯先生跑到前面时，她也跟着跑了。她看见巴克先生脸色苍白，兴奋地走出书房。他拦住了正从楼梯上下来的道格拉斯太太。他恳求她回去，她回答了他，但是她说的话没有人听见。

“Take her up! Stay with her!” he had said to Mrs. Allen.

“带她上去! 跟着她!”他对艾伦太太说。

She had therefore taken her to the bedroom, and endeavoured to soothe her. She was greatly excited, trembling all over, but made no other attempt to go downstairs. She just sat in her dressing gown by her bedroom fire, with her head sunk in her hands. Mrs. Allen stayed with her most of the night. As to the other servants, they had all gone to bed, and the alarm did not reach them until just before the police arrived. They slept at the extreme back of the house, and could not possibly have heard anything.

因此，她把她带到卧室里，努力安慰她。她非常激动，浑身颤抖，但没有再下楼去。她只是穿着睡衣坐在卧室的炉火旁，双手抱着头。艾伦太太大部分时间都和她在一起。至于其他的仆人，他们都已经上床睡觉了，直到警察来之前，他们才收到警报。他们睡在房子的最后面，不可能听到任何声音。

So far the housekeeper could add nothing on cross-examination save lamentations and expressions of amazement.

到目前为止，女管家除了哀叹和惊讶之外，对于反复询问的事情一无所知。

Cecil Barker succeeded Mrs. Allen as a witness. As to the occurrences of the night before, he had very little to add to what he had already told the police. Personally, he was convinced that the murderer had escaped by the window. The bloodstain was conclusive, in his opinion, on that point. Besides, as the bridge was up, there was no other possible way of escaping. He could not explain what had become of the assassin or why he had not taken his bicycle, if it were indeed his. He could not possibly have been drowned in the moat, which was at no place more than three feet deep.

塞西尔 · 巴克接替艾伦太太成为证人。至于前一天晚上发生的事情，除了已经告诉警察的以外，他没有什么可补充的了。就个人而言，他确信凶手是从窗户逃走的。在他看来，血迹在这一点上是决定性的。此外，由于桥是竖起来的，没有其他可能的逃脱方式。他无法解释暗杀者的下落，也无法解释他为什么没有拿走他的自行车，如果那辆自行车确实是他的。他不可能淹死在护城河里，那里的水深不超过三英尺。

In his own mind he had a very definite theory about the murder. Douglas was a reticent man, and there were some chapters in his life of which he never spoke. He had emigrated to America when he was a very young man. He had prospered well, and Barker had first met him in California, where they had become partners in a successful mining claim at a place called Benito Canyon. They had done very well; but Douglas had suddenly sold out and started for England. He was a widower at that time. Barker had afterwards realized his money and come to live in London. Thus they had renewed their friendship.

在他自己的心目中，他对这起谋杀案有一个非常明确的理论。道格拉斯是一个沉默寡言的人，他生命中的某些篇章他从未提及。他很年轻的时候就移民到了美国。他生意兴隆，巴克第一次见到他是在加利福尼亚州，他们在一个叫 Benito Canyon 的地方成功地开采了矿产，并成为了合作伙伴。他们做得很好，但是道格拉斯突然卖掉了房子，动身去了英格兰。那时他是个鳏夫。巴克尔后来意识到了他的钱，来到伦敦定居。他们就这样重新建立了友谊。

Douglas had given him the impression that some danger was hanging over his head, and he had always looked upon his sudden departure from California, and also his renting a house in so quiet a place in England, as being connected with this peril. He imagined that some secret society, some implacable organization, was on Douglas's track, which would never rest until it killed him. Some remarks of his had given him this idea; though he had never told him what the society was, nor how he had come to offend it. He could only suppose that the legend upon the placard had some reference to this secret society.

道格拉斯给他的印象是，某种危险正在他的头上盘旋，他总是把他突然离开加利福尼亚，还有他在英格兰一个非常安静的地方租了一所房子，看作是与这种危险有关的。他想象着某个秘密社团，某个不可调和的组织，就在道格拉斯的轨道上，不杀了他，他是不会罢休的。他的一些言论使他产生了这个想法，虽然他从来没有告诉他这个社团是什么，也没有告诉他他是如何得罪它的。他只能认为标语牌上的传说与这个秘密社团有关。

“How long were you with Douglas in California?” asked Inspector MacDonald.

“你和道格拉斯在加利福尼亚待了多久?”麦克唐纳督察问道。

“Five years altogether.”

“一共五年。”

“He was a bachelor, you say?”

“你说他是个单身汉?”

“A widower.”

”一个鳏夫”

“Have you ever heard where his first wife came from?”

“你听说过他的第一任妻子是从哪里来的吗?”

“No, I remember his saying that she was of German extraction, and I have seen her portrait. She was a very beautiful woman. She died of typhoid the year before I met him.”

“不，我记得他说过她是德国后裔，我见过她的肖像。她是一个非常漂亮的女人。在我遇见他的前一年，她死于伤寒。”

“You don't associate his past with any particular part of America?”

“你不会把他的过去和美国的某个地方联系起来吧?”

“I have heard him talk of Chicago. He knew that city well and had worked there. I have heard him talk of the coal and iron districts. He had travelled a good deal in his time.”

“我听他谈起过芝加哥。他很了解那个城市，并且在那里工作过。我听他谈到过煤矿和铁矿区。他在那个时代旅行过很多地方。”

“Was he a politician? Had this secret society to do with politics?”

“他是政客吗? 这个秘密社团与政治有关吗?”

“No, he cared nothing about politics.”

“不，他对政治一点也不关心。”

“You have no reason to think it was criminal?”

“你没有理由认为这是犯罪吗?”

“On the contrary, I never met a straighter man in my life.”

“恰恰相反，我一生中从未遇到过比他更正直的男人。”

“Was there anything curious about his life in California?”

“他在加利福尼亚的生活有什么奇怪的地方吗?”

“He liked best to stay and to work at our claim in the mountains. He would never go where other men were if he could help it. That's why I first thought that someone was after him. Then when he left so suddenly for Europe I made sure that it was so. I believe that he had a warning of some sort. Within a week of his leaving half a dozen men were inquiring for him.”

“他最喜欢留下来，在我们宣称的山区工作。如果可以的话，他决不会去别人去的地方。这就是为什么我一开始以为有人在追杀他。后来他突然去了欧洲，我确信他就是那样去的。我相信他收到了某种警告。他离开不到一个星期，就有六个人来找他。”

“What sort of men?”

“什么样的人?”

“Well, they were a mighty hard-looking crowd. They came up to the claim and wanted to know where he was. I told them that he was gone to Europe and that I did not know where to find him. They meant him no good—it was easy to see that.”

“好吧，他们是一群看起来很难对付的人。他们来到索赔处，想知道他在哪里。我告诉他们，他去欧洲了，我不知道到哪里去找他。他们对他没有好处，这一点很容易看出来。”

“Were these men Americans—Californians?”

“这些人是美国人ーー加利福尼亚人吗?”

“Well, I don't know about Californians. They were Americans, all right. But they were not miners. I don't know what they were, and was very glad to see their backs.”

“嗯，我不了解加利福尼亚人。他们确实是美国人。但他们不是矿工。我不知道他们是什么人，很高兴看到他们的背影。”

“That was six years ago?”

“那是六年前的事了?”

“Nearer seven.”

“接近七点。”

“And then you were together five years in California, so that this business dates back not less than eleven years at the least?”

“然后你们在加利福尼亚一起生活了五年，所以这个生意至少可以追溯到十一年以前?”

“That is so.”

“的确如此。”

“It must be a very serious feud that would be kept up with such earnestness for as long as that. It would be no light thing that would give rise to it.”

“这肯定是一场非常严重的世仇，只要这样，就会一直保持这种认真态度。这不是一件轻而易举的事情。”

“I think it shadowed his whole life. It was never quite out of his mind.”

“我认为这种情绪影响了他的一生，从来没有完全失去理智。”

“But if a man had a danger hanging over him, and knew what it was, don't you think he would turn to the police for protection?”

“但是，如果一个人身处危险之中，并且知道那是什么，你不认为他会向警察寻求保护吗?”

“Maybe it was some danger that he could not be protected against. There's one thing you should know. He always went about armed. His revolver was never out of his pocket. But, by bad luck, he was in his dressing gown and had left it in the bedroom last night. Once the bridge was up, I guess he thought he was safe.”

“也许是某种危险，使他无法得到保护。有一件事你应该知道。他总是带着武器到处跑。他的左轮手枪从来没有从口袋里掏出来过。但是，由于运气不好，他穿着晨衣，昨晚落在卧室里了。一旦桥梁建成，我猜他就认为自己安全了。”

“I should like these dates a little clearer,” said MacDonald. “It is quite six years since Douglas left California. You followed him next year, did you not?”

麦克唐纳说: “我希望这些日期能更清楚一些。”。“道格拉斯离开加利福尼亚已经有六年了。你明年就跟着他了，是吗?”

“That is so.”

“的确如此。”

“And he had been married five years. You must have returned about the time of his marriage.”

“他已经结婚五年了，你一定是在他结婚的时候回来的。”

“About a month before. I was his best man.”

“大约一个月前，我是他的伴郎。”

“Did you know Mrs. Douglas before her marriage?”

“你在道格拉斯太太结婚前就认识她了吗?”

“No, I did not. I had been away from England for ten years.”

“不，我没有。我离开英国已经十年了。”

“But you have seen a good deal of her since.”

“但是从那以后你就经常见到她了。”

Barker looked sternly at the detective. “I have seen a good deal of him since,” he answered. “If I have seen her, it is because you cannot visit a man without knowing his wife. If you imagine there is any connection—”

巴克严厉地看着侦探。“从那以后我经常见到他,”他回答说。“如果我见过她，那是因为你不可能不认识一个男人的妻子就去拜访他。如果你想象有任何联系——”

“I imagine nothing, Mr. Barker. I am bound to make every inquiry which can bear upon the case. But I mean no offense.”

“我什么也想象不出来，巴克先生。我必须对这个案件作出一切可能的调查。但我无意冒犯。”

“Some inquiries are offensive,” Barker answered angrily.

巴克愤怒地回答: “有些问题令人反感。”。

“It's only the facts that we want. It is in your interest and everyone's interest that they should be cleared up. Did Mr. Douglas entirely approve your friendship with his wife?”

“我们想要的只是事实。为了你的利益和每个人的利益，他们应该得到澄清。道格拉斯先生完全赞同你和他妻子的友谊吗?”

Barker grew paler, and his great, strong hands were clasped convulsively together. “You have no right to ask such questions!” he cried. “What has this to do with the matter you are investigating?”

巴克的脸色越来越苍白，他那双强壮有力的大手抽搐地紧握在一起。“你没有权利问这样的问题!”他哭了起来。“这和你正在调查的事情有什么关系?”

“I must repeat the question.”

“我必须重复这个问题。”

“Well, I refuse to answer.”

“好吧，我拒绝回答。”

“You can refuse to answer; but you must be aware that your refusal is in itself an answer, for you would not refuse if you had not something to conceal.”

“你可以拒绝回答，但你必须知道，你的拒绝本身就是一种回答，因为如果你没有什么要隐瞒的话，你是不会拒绝的。”

Barker stood for a moment with his face set grimly and his strong black eyebrows drawn low in intense thought. Then he looked up with a smile. “Well, I guess you gentlemen are only doing your clear duty after all, and I have no right to stand in the way of it. I'd only ask you not to worry Mrs. Douglas over this matter; for she has enough upon her just now. I may tell you that poor Douglas had just one fault in the world, and that was his jealousy. He was fond of me—no man could be fonder of a friend. And he was devoted to his wife. He loved me to come here, and was forever sending for me. And yet if his wife and I talked together or there seemed any sympathy between us, a kind of wave of jealousy would pass over him, and he would be off the handle and saying the wildest things in a moment. More than once I've sworn off coming for that reason, and then he would write me such penitent, imploring letters that I just had to. But you can take it from me, gentlemen, if it was my last word, that no man ever had a more loving, faithful wife—and I can say also no friend could be more loyal than I!”

巴克站了一会儿，面色严峻，浓密的黑眉毛低垂着，陷入了沉思。然后他微笑着抬起头来。”“好吧，我想你们这些先生们毕竟只是在履行你们明确的职责，我没有权利阻止它。我只想请你不要为这件事担心道格拉斯太太，因为她现在已经有够多的麻烦了。我可以告诉你，可怜的道格拉斯在这个世界上只有一个缺点，那就是嫉妒。他喜欢我ーー没有人会喜欢朋友。他对妻子忠心耿耿。他喜欢我来这里，而且永远派人来接我。然而，如果他的妻子和我在一起谈话，或者我们之间似乎有任何的同情，一种嫉妒的浪潮就会席卷而来，他就会失去控制，一瞬间说出最疯狂的事情。我不止一次发誓为了这个原因不来，然后他就会给我写这样的忏悔信，恳求我不得不这样做。但是，先生们，你们可以相信我的话，如果这是我的最后一句话的话，那就是没有一个男人有一个比我更可爱、更忠诚的妻子ーー而且我可以说，没有一个朋友比我更忠诚!”

It was spoken with fervour and feeling, and yet Inspector MacDonald could not dismiss the subject.

这话说得既热情又有感情，可是麦克唐纳督察却不能不理会这个问题。

“You are aware,” said he, “that the dead man's wedding ring has been taken from his finger?”

“你知道,”他说，“死者的结婚戒指已经从他的手指上取下来了吗?”

“So it appears,” said Barker.

“看起来是这样,”巴克说。

“What do you mean by ‘appears’? You know it as a fact.”

“‘似乎’是什么意思? 你知道这是事实。”

The man seemed confused and undecided. “When I said ‘appears’ I meant that it was conceivable that he had himself taken off the ring.”

这个人看起来很困惑，犹豫不决。“当我说‘看起来’时，我的意思是，可以想象，他自己已经脱下了戒指。”

“The mere fact that the ring should be absent, whoever may have removed it, would suggest to anyone's mind, would it not, that the marriage and the tragedy were connected?”

“不管是谁把戒指拿走了，戒指不在这个事实本身就会让人联想到婚姻和悲剧是有联系的，不是吗?”

Barker shrugged his broad shoulders. “I can't profess to say what it means.” he answered. “But if you mean to hint that it could reflect in any way upon this lady's honour”—his eyes blazed for an instant, and then with an evident effort he got a grip upon his own emotions—“well, you are on the wrong track, that's all.”

巴克耸了耸他宽阔的肩膀。“我不能说出它的意思。”他回答道。“但是，如果你是想暗示，这可能会以任何方式影响这位女士的名誉,”他的眼睛闪烁了一会儿，然后，他明显地努力控制住了自己的情绪，“好吧，你走错路了，就是这样。”

“I don't know that I've anything else to ask you at present,” said MacDonald, coldly.

“我不知道我现在还有什么要问你的,”麦克唐纳冷冷地说。

“There was one small point,” remarked Sherlock Holmes. “When you entered the room there was only a candle lighted on the table, was there not?”

“还有一个小问题,”夏洛克 · 福尔摩斯说。“当你走进房间的时候，桌子上只有一支蜡烛，不是吗?”

“Yes, that was so.”

“是的，确实如此。”

“By its light you saw that some terrible incident had occurred?”

“借着它的光，你看到发生了什么可怕的事情吗?”

“Exactly.”

“没错。”

“You at once rang for help?”

“你立刻打电话求助?”

“Yes.”

“是的。”

“And it arrived very speedily?”

“它很快就到了吗?”

“Within a minute or so.”

“一分钟左右。”

“And yet when they arrived they found that the candle was out and that the lamp had been lighted. That seems very remarkable.”

可是当他们到达的时候，却发现蜡烛已经熄灭，灯已经点亮了。这似乎非常了不起。”

Again Barker showed some signs of indecision. “I don't see that it was remarkable, Mr. Holmes,” he answered after a pause. “The candle threw a very bad light. My first thought was to get a better one. The lamp was on the table; so I lit it.”

巴克再次表现出犹豫不决的样子。“我不觉得这有什么了不起，福尔摩斯先生,”停顿了一会儿，他回答说。“蜡烛发出了很坏的光。我的第一个想法是找一个更好的。灯在桌子上，所以我点燃了它。”

“And blew out the candle?”

“吹灭了蜡烛?”

“Exactly.”

“没错。”

Holmes asked no further question, and Barker, with a deliberate look from one to the other of us, which had, as it seemed to me, something of defiance in it, turned and left the room.

福尔摩斯不再问什么问题，于是巴克带着一种从一个人到另一个人的深思熟虑的目光，转身离开了房间。

Inspector MacDonald had sent up a note to the effect that he would wait upon Mrs. Douglas in her room; but she had replied that she would meet us in the dining room. She entered now, a tall and beautiful woman of thirty, reserved and self-possessed to a remarkable degree, very different from the tragic and distracted figure I had pictured. It is true that her face was pale and drawn, like that of one who has endured a great shock; but her manner was composed, and the finely moulded hand which she rested upon the edge of the table was as steady as my own. Her sad, appealing eyes travelled from one to the other of us with a curiously inquisitive expression. That questioning gaze transformed itself suddenly into abrupt speech.

麦克唐纳督察送来一张纸条，大意是说他要在道格拉斯太太的房间里等她; 但是她回答说她要在餐厅里等我们。她现在进来了，一个三十岁的高个儿美女，内向而沉着，与我想象中那个悲惨而心神不宁的形象大不相同。的确，她的脸色苍白而憔悴，就像一个经受了巨大打击的人一样; 但是她的态度很镇静，她放在桌子边上那只精心塑造的手也像我自己的手一样稳定。她那双忧郁、迷人的眼睛带着好奇的神情从一个人传到另一个人身上。这种质疑的凝视突然变成了一种生硬的语言。

“Have you found anything out yet?” she asked.

“你有什么发现吗?”她问。

Was it my imagination that there was an undertone of fear rather than of hope in the question?

难道是我的想象，在这个问题中有一种恐惧而不是希望的暗示吗？

“We have taken every possible step, Mrs. Douglas,” said the inspector. “You may rest assured that nothing will be neglected.”

“我们已经采取了一切可能的措施，道格拉斯太太,”巡查员说，“您放心，不会有疏忽的。”

“Spare no money,” she said in a dead, even tone. “It is my desire that every possible effort should be made.”

“不要省钱,”她用一种死气沉沉的语气说。“我的愿望是尽一切可能的努力。”

“Perhaps you can tell us something which may throw some light upon the matter.”

“也许你能告诉我们一些情况，使我们对这件事有所了解。”

“I fear not; but all I know is at your service.”

“我不怕，但我所知道的一切都为您服务。”

“We have heard from Mr. Cecil Barker that you did not actually see—that you were never in the room where the tragedy occurred?”

“我们从塞西尔 · 巴克先生那里听说，你实际上并没有看到——你从来没有去过发生悲剧的那个房间?”

“No, he turned me back upon the stairs. He begged me to return to my room.”

“不，他把我转回楼梯上。他求我回到我的房间。”

“Quite so. You had heard the shot, and you had at once come down.”

“的确如此。你听到了枪声，立刻就下来了。”

“I put on my dressing gown and then came down.”

“我穿上晨衣，然后下楼。”

“How long was it after hearing the shot that you were stopped on the stair by Mr. Barker?”

“听到枪声后多久，你在楼梯上被巴克先生拦住了?”

“It may have been a couple of minutes. It is so hard to reckon time at such a moment. He implored me not to go on. He assured me that I could do nothing. Then Mrs. Allen, the housekeeper, led me upstairs again. It was all like some dreadful dream.”

“可能只有几分钟。在这样的时刻计算时间是很困难的。他恳求我不要再说下去了。他向我保证我什么也做不了。然后，管家艾伦太太又把我领上楼。这一切就像是一场噩梦。”

“Can you give us any idea how long your husband had been downstairs before you heard the shot?”

“你能告诉我们在你听到枪声之前，你丈夫在楼下多久了吗?”

“No, I cannot say. He went from his dressing room, and I did not hear him go. He did the round of the house every night, for he was nervous of fire. It is the only thing that I have ever known him nervous of.”

”“不，我不能说。他从更衣室出来，我没有听见他走。他每天晚上都在屋子里转来转去，因为他怕火。这是我所知道的他唯一紧张的事情。”

“That is just the point which I want to come to, Mrs. Douglas. You have known your husband only in England, have you not?”

“这正是我想谈的问题，道格拉斯太太。你只在英国认识你的丈夫，不是吗?”

“Yes, we have been married five years.”

“是的，我们已经结婚五年了。”

“Have you heard him speak of anything which occurred in America and might bring some danger upon him?”

“你有没有听他说起过在美国发生的任何可能给他带来危险的事情?”

Mrs. Douglas thought earnestly before she answered. “Yes.” she said at last, “I have always felt that there was a danger hanging over him. He refused to discuss it with me. It was not from want of confidence in me—there was the most complete love and confidence between us—but it was out of his desire to keep all alarm away from me. He thought I should brood over it if I knew all, and so he was silent.”

道格拉斯太太在回答之前认真地想了想。“是的。”最后她说: “我总觉得他有危险。他拒绝和我讨论这件事。这不是因为对我缺乏信心ーー我们之间有着最完整的爱和信心ーー而是因为他不想让我受到任何惊吓。他认为如果我什么都知道的话，我应该仔细考虑一下，所以他没有说话。”

“How did you know it, then?”

“那你是怎么知道的?”

Mrs. Douglas's face lit with a quick smile. “Can a husband ever carry about a secret all his life and a woman who loves him have no suspicion of it? I knew it by his refusal to talk about some episodes in his American life. I knew it by certain precautions he took. I knew it by certain words he let fall. I knew it by the way he looked at unexpected strangers. I was perfectly certain that he had some powerful enemies, that he believed they were on his track, and that he was always on his guard against them. I was so sure of it that for years I have been terrified if ever he came home later than was expected.”

道格拉斯太太脸上露出了快乐的微笑。“一个丈夫难道一辈子都背负着一个秘密，一个爱他的女人对此毫不怀疑吗？通过他拒绝谈论他在美国生活中的一些事件，我知道了这一点。我是通过他采取的某些预防措施知道这件事的。我从他说的某些话中知道了这一点。我从他看不速之客的眼神就知道这一点。我非常肯定他有一些强大的敌人，他相信他们在他的轨道上，他总是在他的防范他们。我非常确信这一点，以至于多年来，如果他比预期的晚回家，我都会感到恐惧。”

“Might I ask,” asked Holmes, “what the words were which attracted your attention?”

“我能问一下,”福尔摩斯问道，“是什么话引起了你的注意?”

“The Valley of Fear,” the lady answered. “That was an expression he has used when I questioned him. ‘I have been in the Valley of Fear. I am not out of it yet.’—‘Are we never to get out of the Valley of Fear?’ I have asked him when I have seen him more serious than usual. ‘Sometimes I think that we never shall,’ he has answered.”

“恐惧谷,”女士回答。“我问他的时候，他就是这么说的。”“我去过恐惧谷。我还没有从中解脱出来。难道我们永远也走不出恐惧之谷吗我问过他什么时候看到他比平时更严肃。“有时候我觉得我们永远也不会,”他回答说

“Surely you asked him what he meant by the Valley of Fear?”

“你不是问过他恐惧谷是什么意思吗?”

“I did; but his face would become very grave and he would shake his head. ‘It is bad enough that one of us should have been in its shadow,’ he said. ‘Please God it shall never fall upon you!’ It was some real valley in which he had lived and in which something terrible had occurred to him, of that I am certain; but I can tell you no more.”

”“是的，但是他的脸色会变得很严肃，他会摇摇头。他说，我们中的一个应该生活在它的阴影下，这已经够糟糕的了。“求你了，上帝，它永远不会降临到你身上！这是一个他曾经住过的真正的山谷，我敢肯定，他在那里发生了一件可怕的事情，但我不能再多说了

“And he never mentioned any names?”

“他从来没有提到过任何名字?”

“Yes, he was delirious with fever once when he had his hunting accident three years ago. Then I remember that there was a name that came continually to his lips. He spoke it with anger and a sort of horror. McGinty was the name—Bodymaster McGinty. I asked him when he recovered who Bodymaster McGinty was, and whose body he was master of. ‘Never of mine, thank God!’ he answered with a laugh, and that was all I could get from him. But there is a connection between Bodymaster McGinty and the Valley of Fear.”

“是的，三年前他打猎出了事故，有一次发烧烧得神志不清。然后我想起有一个名字不断地出现在他的嘴边。他带着愤怒和一种恐惧的口吻说道。他的名字叫做“身体大师”麦金蒂。我问他什么时候恢复健康，谁是麦金蒂的身体，他是谁的身体的主人。”“我从来没有，谢天谢地！”他笑着回答，这就是我能从他那里得到的全部。但是在“身体大师”麦金蒂和“恐惧谷”之间有一种联系。”

“There is one other point,” said Inspector MacDonald. “You met Mr. Douglas in a boarding house in London, did you not, and became engaged to him there? Was there any romance, anything secret or mysterious, about the wedding?”

“还有一点,”麦克唐纳督察说。”“你是在伦敦的一所公寓里遇见道格拉斯先生的，对吗？关于这场婚礼，有没有什么浪漫、秘密或者神秘的东西?”

“There was romance. There is always romance. There was nothing mysterious.”

“有浪漫。总是有浪漫。没有什么神秘的。”

“He had no rival?”

“他没有对手吗?”

“No, I was quite free.”

“不，我很自由。”

“You have heard, no doubt, that his wedding ring has been taken. Does that suggest anything to you? Suppose that some enemy of his old life had tracked him down and committed this crime, what possible reason could he have for taking his wedding ring?”

“毫无疑问，你已经听说他的结婚戒指被拿走了。这对你来说有什么意义吗？假如他过去的敌人找到了他，犯下了这个罪行，他又有什么可能的理由拿走他的结婚戒指呢?”

For an instant I could have sworn that the faintest shadow of a smile flickered over the woman's lips.

有那么一瞬间，我可以发誓那个女人的嘴唇上闪烁着最微弱的一丝微笑。

“I really cannot tell,” she answered. “It is certainly a most extraordinary thing.”

“我真的不知道,”她回答说，“这当然是一件非同寻常的事情。”

“Well, we will not detain you any longer, and we are sorry to have put you to this trouble at such a time,” said the inspector. “There are some other points, no doubt; but we can refer to you as they arise.”

“好吧，我们不再拘留你了，很抱歉在这种时候给你添麻烦,”巡查员说。“当然还有其他一些问题，但是我们可以在它们出现的时候提到你。”

She rose, and I was again conscious of that quick, questioning glance with which she had just surveyed us. “What impression has my evidence made upon you?” The question might as well have been spoken. Then, with a bow, she swept from the room.

她站了起来，我再次意识到她刚才用那种快速的、疑惑的目光打量着我们。“我的证据给你留下了什么印象?”这个问题还不如说出来。然后，她鞠了一躬，从房间里走了出来。

“She's a beautiful woman—a very beautiful woman,” said MacDonald thoughtfully, after the door had closed behind her. “This man Barker has certainly been down here a good deal. He is a man who might be attractive to a woman. He admits that the dead man was jealous, and maybe he knew best himself what cause he had for jealousy. Then there's that wedding ring. You can't get past that. The man who tears a wedding ring off a dead man's—What do you say to it, Mr. Holmes?”

“她是一个美丽的女人ーー一个非常美丽的女人,”麦克唐纳若有所思地说，门在她身后关上了。“这个叫巴克的人肯定来过这里很久了。他是一个可能对女人有吸引力的男人。他承认那个死去的男人是嫉妒的，也许他自己最清楚他嫉妒的原因。还有那个结婚戒指。你无法忘记这一点。那个从死人身上扯下结婚戒指的人ーー你对此有什么看法，福尔摩斯先生?”

My friend had sat with his head upon his hands, sunk in the deepest thought. Now he rose and rang the bell. “Ames,” he said, when the butler entered, “where is Mr. Cecil Barker now?”

我的朋友坐在那里，头枕在手上，陷入了最深的思考。现在他站起来，按响了门铃。“艾姆斯,”管家进来时他说，“塞西尔 · 巴克先生现在在哪里?”

“I'll see, sir.”

“我看看，先生。”

He came back in a moment to say that Barker was in the garden.

过了一会儿，他回来说巴克在花园里。

“Can you remember, Ames, what Mr. Barker had on his feet last night when you joined him in the study?”

“艾姆斯，你还记得昨晚你和巴克先生一起进书房时他的脚上穿了什么吗?”

“Yes, Mr. Holmes. He had a pair of bedroom slippers. I brought him his boots when he went for the police.”

“是的，福尔摩斯先生。他有一双卧室拖鞋。他去报警的时候，我给他带了靴子。”

“Where are the slippers now?”

“拖鞋现在在哪儿?”

“They are still under the chair in the hall.”

“他们还在大厅的椅子下面。”

“Very good, Ames. It is, of course, important for us to know which tracks may be Mr. Barker's and which from outside.”

“很好，艾米斯。当然，我们必须知道哪些痕迹可能是巴克先生的，哪些来自外部。”

“Yes, sir. I may say that I noticed that the slippers were stained with blood—so indeed were my own.”

“是的，先生。我可以说，我注意到拖鞋上有血迹——所以确实是我的。”

“That is natural enough, considering the condition of the room. Very good, Ames. We will ring if we want you.”

“考虑到房间的情况，这很正常。很好，艾米斯。如果我们需要你，我们会给你打电话的。”

A few minutes later we were in the study. Holmes had brought with him the carpet slippers from the hall. As Ames had observed, the soles of both were dark with blood.

几分钟后，我们进入了书房。福尔摩斯从大厅里带来了一双拖鞋。正如艾姆斯所观察到的，两只脚掌都沾满了鲜血。

“Strange!” murmured Holmes, as he stood in the light of the window and examined them minutely. “Very strange indeed!”

“奇怪!”福尔摩斯站在窗户的灯光下，细细地打量着他们，喃喃地说，“真是奇怪!”

Stooping with one of his quick feline pounces, he placed the slipper upon the blood mark on the sill. It exactly corresponded. He smiled in silence at his colleagues.

他弯下腰，迅速扑向一只猫，把拖鞋放在窗台上的血迹上。完全一致。他默默地对同事们笑了笑。

The inspector was transfigured with excitement. His native accent rattled like a stick upon railings.

检查员兴奋得容光焕发，他的乡音嘎嘎作响，就像一根棍子敲在栏杆上。

“Man,” he cried, “there's not a doubt of it! Barker has just marked the window himself. It's a good deal broader than any bootmark. I mind that you said it was a splay-foot, and here's the explanation. But what's the game, Mr. Holmes—what's the game?”

“伙计,”他喊道，“这是毫无疑问的！巴克刚刚亲自在窗户上做了记号。这比任何鞋印都要宽广得多。我记得你说那是张开的脚，这就是解释。但是，福尔摩斯先生，这是什么游戏

“Ay, what's the game?” my friend repeated thoughtfully.

“啊，这是什么游戏?”我的朋友若有所思地重复道。

White Mason chuckled and rubbed his fat hands together in his professional satisfaction. “I said it was a snorter!” he cried. “And a real snorter it is!”

怀特 · 梅森轻声笑了笑，用他那肥胖的手搓了搓，表示对自己职业生涯的满意。“我说那是一种鼻息声!”他哭了起来。“而且是一个真正的鼻息!”
