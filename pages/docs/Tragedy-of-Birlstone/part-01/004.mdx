  title: "Chapter IV. Darkness 黑暗",
  book: "The Tragedy of Birlstone"
}


At three in the morning the chief Sussex detective, obeying the urgent call from Sergeant Wilson of Birlstone, arrived from headquarters in a light dog-cart behind a breathless trotter. By the five-forty train in the morning he had sent his message to Scotland Yard, and he was at the Birlstone station at twelve o'clock to welcome us. White Mason was a quiet, comfortable-looking person in a loose tweed suit, with a clean-shaved, ruddy face, a stoutish body, and powerful bandy legs adorned with gaiters, looking like a small farmer, a retired gamekeeper, or anything upon earth except a very favourable specimen of the provincial criminal officer.

凌晨三点，苏塞克斯警长听从 Birlstone 警长威尔逊的紧急呼叫，驾着一辆轻便的狗车，在一辆气喘吁吁的马车后面，从总部赶到了这里。早上五点四十分的火车上，他已经给伦敦警察厅送去了信，十二点钟的时候他在 Birlstone 车站迎接我们。怀特 · 梅森是一个安静、舒适的人，穿着宽松的花呢西装，脸色红润，身材粗壮，腿上绑着绑腿，看起来像个小农民，像个退休的猎场看守，或者像地球上除了一个非常受欢迎的省级刑事官员之外的任何人。

“A real downright snorter, Mr. MacDonald!” he kept repeating. “We'll have the pressmen down like flies when they understand it. I'm hoping we will get our work done before they get poking their noses into it and messing up all the trails. There has been nothing like this that I can remember. There are some bits that will come home to you, Mr. Holmes, or I am mistaken. And you also, Dr. Watson; for the medicos will have a word to say before we finish. Your room is at the Westville Arms. There's no other place; but I hear that it is clean and good. The man will carry your bags. This way, gentlemen, if you please.”

“麦克唐纳先生，真是个大鼻子!”他一直在重复。“当印刷工人们明白这一点的时候，他们就会像苍蝇一样扑倒在地。我希望我们能在他们插手干预并破坏所有线索之前完成我们的工作。我记得从来没有过这样的事情。福尔摩斯先生，有些事情你会明白的，要不就是我弄错了。还有你，华生医生，因为在我们结束之前，医生们有话要说。你的房间在韦斯特维尔。没有别的地方了，但是我听说那里很干净很好。那个人会帮你提行李。请这边走，先生们。”

He was a very bustling and genial person, this Sussex detective. In ten minutes we had all found our quarters. In ten more we were seated in the parlour of the inn and being treated to a rapid sketch of those events which have been outlined in the previous chapter. MacDonald made an occasional note, while Holmes sat absorbed, with the expression of surprised and reverent admiration with which the botanist surveys the rare and precious bloom.

这位苏塞克斯侦探是一个忙碌而和蔼可亲的人。十分钟后，我们都找到了住处。又过了十几天，我们坐在客店的客厅里，听着上一章所概述的那些事情的大致情况。麦克唐纳偶尔做了笔记，而霍姆斯则坐在那里专心致志地看着，神情既惊讶又虔诚地赞赏着植物学家察看那罕见而珍贵的花朵。

“Remarkable!” he said, when the story was unfolded, “most remarkable! I can hardly recall any case where the features have been more peculiar.”

“真了不起!”他说，当这个故事展开的时候，“太不可思议了！我几乎想不起有什么地方的特征比这更奇特了。”

“I thought you would say so, Mr. Holmes,” said White Mason in great delight. “We're well up with the times in Sussex. I've told you now how matters were, up to the time when I took over from Sergeant Wilson between three and four this morning. My word! I made the old mare go! But I need not have been in such a hurry, as it turned out; for there was nothing immediate that I could do. Sergeant Wilson had all the facts. I checked them and considered them and maybe added a few of my own.”

“我就知道你会这么说，福尔摩斯先生,”怀特 · 梅森高兴地说。“苏塞克斯的时代已经过去了。我现在已经告诉你事情的经过，直到今天凌晨三点到四点我接替威尔逊中士的职务。我的天！我把那匹老母马赶走了！但是事实证明，我并不需要这么匆忙，因为眼下我也无能为力。威尔逊中士掌握了所有的事实。我检查了一下，考虑了一下，也许还加了一些我自己的。”

“What were they?” asked Holmes eagerly.

“那是什么?”福尔摩斯急切地问。

“Well, I first had the hammer examined. There was Dr. Wood there to help me. We found no signs of violence upon it. I was hoping that if Mr. Douglas defended himself with the hammer, he might have left his mark upon the murderer before he dropped it on the mat. But there was no stain.”

“嗯，我先检查了锤子。伍德医生在那里帮助我。我们在上面没有发现任何暴力的迹象。我希望如果道格拉斯先生用锤子为自己辩护的话，他可能会在凶手把锤子摔在垫子上之前在上面留下他的印记。但是没有污点。”

“That, of course, proves nothing at all,” remarked Inspector MacDonald. “There has been many a hammer murder and no trace on the hammer.”

“那当然什么也证明不了,”麦克唐纳督察说。“已经发生了很多锤子谋杀案，但锤子上没有任何痕迹。”

“Quite so. It doesn't prove it wasn't used. But there might have been stains, and that would have helped us. As a matter of fact there were none. Then I examined the gun. They were buckshot cartridges, and, as Sergeant Wilson pointed out, the triggers were wired together so that, if you pulled on the hinder one, both barrels were discharged. Whoever fixed that up had made up his mind that he was going to take no chances of missing his man. The sawed gun was not more than two foot long—one could carry it easily under one's coat. There was no complete maker's name; but the printed letters P-E-N were on the fluting between the barrels, and the rest of the name had been cut off by the saw.”

“的确如此。这并不能证明它没有被使用过。但是可能会有污点，这对我们会有帮助。事实上没有。然后我检查了枪。它们是大号弹壳，正如威尔逊中士指出的那样，扳机是连在一起的，所以，如果你拉动后面那个，两个枪管都会发射出去。不管是谁安排的，他已经下定决心，不能错过他的对手。这把锯短的枪不超过两英尺长，人们可以轻易地把它藏在外套下面。没有完整的制造商的名字，但是桶之间的凹槽上印着 P-E-N，其余的名字都被锯子锯掉了。”

“A big P with a flourish above it, E and N smaller?” asked Holmes.

福尔摩斯问道: “一个大的 p，上面有一个夸张的动作，e 和 n 要小一些?”。

“Exactly.”

“没错。”

“Pennsylvania Small Arms Company—well-known American firm,” said Holmes.

“宾夕法尼亚州小型武器公司ーー美国著名的公司,”霍姆斯说。

White Mason gazed at my friend as the little village practitioner looks at the Harley Street specialist who by a word can solve the difficulties that perplex him.

怀特 · 梅森凝视着我的朋友，村里的小医生看着哈利街的医生，这位医生用一句话就可以解决困扰他的难题。

“That is very helpful, Mr. Holmes. No doubt you are right. Wonderful! Wonderful! Do you carry the names of all the gun makers in the world in your memory?”

”“那很有帮助，福尔摩斯先生。毫无疑问你是对的。太棒了！太棒了！你记得世界上所有枪械制造商的名字吗?”

Holmes dismissed the subject with a wave.

福尔摩斯挥手打断了这个话题。

“No doubt it is an American shotgun,” White Mason continued. “I seem to have read that a sawed-off shotgun is a weapon used in some parts of America. Apart from the name upon the barrel, the idea had occurred to me. There is some evidence then, that this man who entered the house and killed its master was an American.”

“毫无疑问，这是一把美国猎枪,”怀特 · 梅森继续说道。“我似乎读到过削短型猎枪是美国部分地区使用的武器。除了桶上的名字外，我还想到了这个主意。那么，有一些证据表明，这个进入房子并杀死主人的人是一个美国人。”

MacDonald shook his head. “Man, you are surely travelling overfast,” said he. “I have heard no evidence yet that any stranger was ever in the house at all.”

麦克唐纳摇了摇头。“伙计，你肯定是开得太快了,”他说。“我还没有听到任何证据表明有任何陌生人进过这所房子。”

“The open window, the blood on the sill, the queer card, the marks of boots in the corner, the gun!”

“打开的窗户，窗台上的血迹，古怪的牌，角落里靴子的印记，还有枪!”

“Nothing there that could not have been arranged. Mr. Douglas was an American, or had lived long in America. So had Mr. Barker. You don't need to import an American from outside in order to account for American doings.”

“没有什么不可能安排好的。道格拉斯先生是美国人，或者说在美国生活了很长时间。巴克先生也是。你不需要从国外进口一个美国人来解释美国的所作所为。”

“Ames, the butler—”

“艾姆斯，管家——”

“What about him? Is he reliable?”

“他怎么样? 他可靠吗?”

“Ten years with Sir Charles Chandos—as solid as a rock. He has been with Douglas ever since he took the Manor House five years ago. He has never seen a gun of this sort in the house.”

“与查尔斯•钱多斯爵士(Sir Charles chandos)共事十年——牢不可破。自从道格拉斯五年前入主这个庄园以来，他一直和他在一起。他在家里从来没有见过这种枪。”

“The gun was made to conceal. That's why the barrels were sawed. It would fit into any box. How could he swear there was no such gun in the house?”

“这把枪是用来隐藏的。这就是为什么桶是锯开的。它可以放进任何盒子里。他怎么能发誓家里没有这样的枪呢?”

“Well, anyhow, he had never seen one.”

“好吧，不管怎么说，他从来没有见过。”

MacDonald shook his obstinate Scotch head. “I'm not convinced yet that there was ever anyone in the house,” said he. “I'm asking you to conseedar” (his accent became more Aberdonian as he lost himself in his argument) “I'm asking you to conseedar what it involves if you suppose that this gun was ever brought into the house, and that all these strange things were done by a person from outside. Oh, man, it's just inconceivable! It's clean against common sense! I put it to you, Mr. Holmes, judging it by what we have heard.”

麦克唐纳摇摇他那顽固的苏格兰脑袋。他说: “我还不相信这个房子里有人。”。“我请求你把枪放进屋里，假设所有这些奇怪的事情都是外面的人干的，我请求你把枪放进屋里，假设所有这些奇怪的事情都是外面的人干的。天啊，这简直难以置信！它是干净的，违反常识！福尔摩斯先生，根据我们所听到的来判断。”

“Well, state your case, Mr. Mac,” said Holmes in his most judicial style.

“麦克先生，请陈述你的案情。”福尔摩斯用他最司法的口吻说。

“The man is not a burglar, supposing that he ever existed. The ring business and the card point to premeditated murder for some private reason. Very good. Here is a man who slips into a house with the deliberate intention of committing murder. He knows, if he knows anything, that he will have a deeficulty in making his escape, as the house is surrounded with water. What weapon would he choose? You would say the most silent in the world. Then he could hope when the deed was done to slip quickly from the window, to wade the moat, and to get away at his leisure. That's understandable. But is it understandable that he should go out of his way to bring with him the most noisy weapon he could select, knowing well that it will fetch every human being in the house to the spot as quick as they can run, and that it is all odds that he will be seen before he can get across the moat? Is that credible, Mr. Holmes?”

“假如这个人真的存在，他就不是一个窃贼。戒指和名片都指向了谋杀，因为一些私人原因。很好。这里有一个男人溜进一所房子，蓄意谋杀。他知道，如果他知道什么的话，他在逃跑时会遇到麻烦，因为房子周围都是水。他会选择什么武器？你会说是世界上最沉默的人。这样，他就可以指望做完这件事后，能够迅速地从窗口溜走，涉过护城河，从容不迫地离开。这是可以理解的。但是，他应该不怕麻烦地带上他所能选择的最嘈杂的武器，这可以理解吗? 因为他知道，这种武器会让屋子里的每个人都尽快赶到现场，而且很可能在他穿过护城河之前就会被发现？这可信吗，福尔摩斯先生?”

“Well, you put the case strongly,” my friend replied thoughtfully. “It certainly needs a good deal of justification. May I ask, Mr. White Mason, whether you examined the farther side of the moat at once to see if there were any signs of the man having climbed out from the water?”

“好吧，你说得很有力,”我的朋友若有所思地回答。“这当然需要大量的理由。怀特 · 梅森先生，请问您是否立刻检查了护城河那边，看看有没有那个人从水里爬出来的迹象?”

“There were no signs, Mr. Holmes. But it is a stone ledge, and one could hardly expect them.”

“那里没有标志，福尔摩斯先生。但那是一块石头的平台，人们几乎不能指望它们。”

“No tracks or marks?”

“没有痕迹或者标记?”

“None.”

“没有。”

“Ha! Would there be any objection, Mr. White Mason, to our going down to the house at once? There may possibly be some small point which might be suggestive.”

“哈！怀特 · 梅森先生，我们马上到楼下去，有什么异议吗？可能存在一些小问题，可能具有启发性。”

“I was going to propose it, Mr. Holmes; but I thought it well to put you in touch with all the facts before we go. I suppose if anything should strike you—” White Mason looked doubtfully at the amateur.

”“我本来是要提出来的，福尔摩斯先生，但是我认为在我们走之前最好让你了解一下所有的事实。我想如果你有什么感觉的话——”怀特 · 梅森怀疑地看着这个业余的人。

“I have worked with Mr. Holmes before,” said Inspector MacDonald. “He plays the game.”

“我以前和福尔摩斯先生一起工作过,”麦克唐纳探长说，“他玩这个游戏。”

“My own idea of the game, at any rate,” said Holmes, with a smile. “I go into a case to help the ends of justice and the work of the police. If I have ever separated myself from the official force, it is because they have first separated themselves from me. I have no wish ever to score at their expense. At the same time, Mr. White Mason, I claim the right to work in my own way and give my results at my own time—complete rather than in stages.”

“无论如何，这是我自己对这个游戏的看法,”福尔摩斯笑着说。“我参与一个案件是为了帮助司法和警察的工作。如果说我曾经脱离过官方势力，那是因为他们首先脱离了我。我决不愿意以他们为代价去得分。与此同时，怀特 · 梅森先生，我声称有权按照自己的方式工作，并在自己的时间内给出结果ーー完成而不是分阶段。”

“I am sure we are honoured by your presence and to show you all we know,” said White Mason cordially. “Come along, Dr. Watson, and when the time comes we'll all hope for a place in your book.”

怀特 · 梅森诚挚地说: “我相信我们对你的到来感到荣幸，并向你展示我们所知道的一切。”。“来吧，华生医生，到时候我们都希望在你的书中占有一席之地。”

We walked down the quaint village street with a row of pollarded elms on each side of it. Just beyond were two ancient stone pillars, weather-stained and lichen-blotched bearing upon their summits a shapeless something which had once been the rampant lion of Capus of Birlstone. A short walk along the winding drive with such sward and oaks around it as one only sees in rural England, then a sudden turn, and the long, low Jacobean house of dingy, liver-coloured brick lay before us, with an old-fashioned garden of cut yews on each side of it. As we approached it, there was the wooden drawbridge and the beautiful broad moat as still and luminous as quicksilver in the cold, winter sunshine.

我们沿着古色古香的乡村街道走去，街道两旁各种榆树。再过去不远处是两根古老的石柱，上面沾满了风霜和青苔，顶上挂着一个不成形的东西，它曾经是 Birlstone 的卡普斯(Capus)那头猖狂的狮子。沿着蜿蜒的小径走一小段路，四周环绕着人们只能在英格兰乡村看到的草地和橡树，然后突然转弯，我们面前就是一座长长的、矮矮的詹姆士时代的房子，房子的两边是一座老式的紫杉园。当我们走近它的时候，那里有一座木制的吊桥和一条美丽的宽阔的护城河，在寒冷的冬日阳光下静止而明亮，就像水银一样。

Three centuries had flowed past the old Manor House, centuries of births and of homecomings, of country dances and of the meetings of fox hunters. Strange that now in its old age this dark business should have cast its shadow upon the venerable walls! And yet those strange, peaked roofs and quaint, overhung gables were a fitting covering to grim and terrible intrigue. As I looked at the deep-set windows and the long sweep of the dull-coloured, water-lapped front, I felt that no more fitting scene could be set for such a tragedy.

三个世纪过去了，几个世纪的出生，几个世纪的回家，几个世纪的乡村舞蹈，几个世纪的猎狐者的聚会。奇怪的是，现在这黑暗的生意已经老了，它的影子竟然投射在庄严的墙上！然而，那些奇怪的尖顶屋顶和古色古香的悬挑山墙却恰好掩盖了阴森可怕的阴谋。当我看着那深深的落地窗，看着那长长的、暗色的、水洗过的前窗，我觉得再也没有比这样的悲剧更合适的场景了。

“That's the window,” said White Mason, “that one on the immediate right of the drawbridge. It's open just as it was found last night.”

“就是那扇窗户,”怀特 · 梅森说，“就是吊桥右边那扇。它和昨晚被发现时一样开着。”

“It looks rather narrow for a man to pass.”

“对于一个男人来说，这条路看起来太窄了。”

“Well, it wasn't a fat man, anyhow. We don't need your deductions, Mr. Holmes, to tell us that. But you or I could squeeze through all right.”

”“好吧，不管怎么说，那不是一个胖子。福尔摩斯先生，我们不需要你的推理来告诉我们这些。但是你或者我可以挤过去。”

Holmes walked to the edge of the moat and looked across. Then he examined the stone ledge and the grass border beyond it.

福尔摩斯走到护城河边，向对面望去。然后他仔细观察了石头的边缘和那边的草地。

“I've had a good look, Mr. Holmes,” said White Mason. “There is nothing there, no sign that anyone has landed—but why should he leave any sign?”

“我看得很清楚，福尔摩斯先生,”怀特 · 梅森说。“那里什么也没有，没有任何人登陆的迹象ーー但他为什么要留下任何迹象呢?”

“Exactly. Why should he? Is the water always turbid?”

“没错。他为什么要这么做? 水总是浑浊的吗?”

“Generally about this colour. The stream brings down the clay.”

一般是这种颜色，小溪流下泥土

“How deep is it?”

“有多深?”

“About two feet at each side and three in the middle.”

两边大约两英尺，中间三英尺

“So we can put aside all idea of the man having been drowned in crossing.”

“所以我们可以把那个人在交叉路口淹死的想法放在一边。”

“No, a child could not be drowned in it.”

“不，一个孩子不可能淹死在里面。”

We walked across the drawbridge, and were admitted by a quaint, gnarled, dried-up person, who was the butler, Ames. The poor old fellow was white and quivering from the shock. The village sergeant, a tall, formal, melancholy man, still held his vigil in the room of Fate. The doctor had departed.

我们走过吊桥，一个古怪、粗糙、干瘪的管家艾姆斯让我们进去。这个可怜的老家伙脸色苍白，因为震惊而颤抖。村里的中士，一个身材高大，举止庄重，忧郁的人，仍然在命运的房间里守夜。医生已经走了。

“Anything fresh, Sergeant Wilson?” asked White Mason.

“有什么新鲜事吗，威尔逊中士?”怀特 · 梅森问。

“No, sir.”

“没有，先生。”

“Then you can go home. You've had enough. We can send for you if we want you. The butler had better wait outside. Tell him to warn Mr. Cecil Barker, Mrs. Douglas, and the housekeeper that we may want a word with them presently. Now, gentlemen, perhaps you will allow me to give you the views I have formed first, and then you will be able to arrive at your own.”

“然后你就可以回家了。你喝得够多了。如果我们需要你，我们可以派人去接你。管家最好在外面等着。告诉他去通知塞西尔 · 巴克先生、道格拉斯太太和管家，我们可能马上要和他们谈谈。现在，先生们，也许你们可以允许我先向你们介绍一下我所形成的观点，然后你们就可以达成自己的看法了。”

He impressed me, this country specialist. He had a solid grip of fact and a cool, clear, common-sense brain, which should take him some way in his profession. Holmes listened to him intently, with no sign of that impatience which the official exponent too often produced.

他给我这个乡村专家留下了深刻的印象。他对事实了如指掌，头脑冷静、清晰、有常识，这应该会给他的职业带来一些启示。福尔摩斯聚精会神地听着他说话，丝毫没有那位官方解说员常常表现出的那种不耐烦的神情。

“Is it suicide, or is it murder—that's our first question, gentlemen, is it not? If it were suicide, then we have to believe that this man began by taking off his wedding ring and concealing it; that he then came down here in his dressing gown, trampled mud into a corner behind the curtain in order to give the idea someone had waited for him, opened the window, put blood on the—”

“是自杀，还是谋杀? 这是我们的第一个问题，先生们，不是吗？如果是自杀，那么我们只能相信这个男人先是摘下他的结婚戒指并把它藏了起来，然后穿着睡衣来到这里，把泥巴踩在窗帘后面的一个角落里，以便让人以为有人在等他，打开窗户，把血洒在...”

“We can surely dismiss that,” said MacDonald.

麦克唐纳表示: “我们完全可以忽略这一点。”。

“So I think. Suicide is out of the question. Then a murder has been done. What we have to determine is, whether it was done by someone outside or inside the house.”

“我想也是。自杀是不可能的。那就是谋杀了。我们需要确定的是，这件事到底是屋外还是屋内的人干的。”

“Well, let's hear the argument.”

“好吧，让我们听听你们的意见。”

“There are considerable difficulties both ways, and yet one or the other it must be. We will suppose first that some person or persons inside the house did the crime. They got this man down here at a time when everything was still and yet no one was asleep. They then did the deed with the queerest and noisiest weapon in the world so as to tell everyone what had happened—a weapon that was never seen in the house before. That does not seem a very likely start, does it?”

“两方面都有相当多的困难，但总会有一个或另一个。我们首先假设房子里的某个人或某些人犯了罪。他们把这个人带到这里来的时候，这里一片寂静，却没有一个人睡着。然后，他们用世界上最奇怪、最吵闹的武器做了这件事，以便告诉所有人发生了什么事——一种以前从未在家里见过的武器。这似乎不太可能成为一个开端，不是吗?”

“No, it does not.”

“不，不是的。”

“Well, then, everyone is agreed that after the alarm was given only a minute at the most had passed before the whole household—not Mr. Cecil Barker alone, though he claims to have been the first, but Ames and all of them were on the spot. Do you tell me that in that time the guilty person managed to make footmarks in the corner, open the window, mark the sill with blood, take the wedding ring off the dead man's finger, and all the rest of it? It's impossible!”

“那么，每个人都同意，闹钟最多只响了一分钟，全家人都知道了——不是塞西尔 · 巴克先生一个人，尽管他自称是第一个，但艾姆斯和他们所有人都在现场。你是否告诉我，在那段时间里，罪犯在角落里留下了脚印，打开了窗户，在窗台上留下了血迹，从死者的手指上取下了结婚戒指，还有其他所有的一切？这是不可能的!”

“You put it very clearly,” said Holmes. “I am inclined to agree with you.”

“你说得很清楚,”福尔摩斯说，“我倾向于同意你的看法。”

“Well, then, we are driven back to the theory that it was done by someone from outside. We are still faced with some big difficulties; but anyhow they have ceased to be impossibilities. The man got into the house between four-thirty and six; that is to say, between dusk and the time when the bridge was raised. There had been some visitors, and the door was open; so there was nothing to prevent him. He may have been a common burglar, or he may have had some private grudge against Mr. Douglas. Since Mr. Douglas has spent most of his life in America, and this shotgun seems to be an American weapon, it would seem that the private grudge is the more likely theory. He slipped into this room because it was the first he came to, and he hid behind the curtain. There he remained until past eleven at night. At that time Mr. Douglas entered the room. It was a short interview, if there were any interview at all; for Mrs. Douglas declares that her husband had not left her more than a few minutes when she heard the shot.”

“好吧，那么，我们又回到了这样一个理论: 这件事是由外部人士干的。我们仍然面临着一些大的困难，但不管怎样，它们已经不再是不可能的了。那人在四点半到六点之间进了屋子，也就是说，在黄昏到桥梁升起的时间之间。有几个客人来过，门是开着的，所以没有什么能阻止他。他可能是一个普通的窃贼，也可能对道格拉斯先生有私人恩怨。由于道格拉斯先生大部分时间都在美国度过，而这把猎枪似乎是美国人的武器，所以私人恩怨似乎是更可能的理论。他溜进这个房间，因为这是他第一次醒来，他躲在帘子后面。他在那里一直呆到晚上十一点多。这时，道格拉斯先生走进了房间。如果有任何采访的话，那也只是一个简短的采访; 因为道格拉斯夫人说，她听到枪声时，她丈夫离开她的时间还不到几分钟

“The candle shows that,” said Holmes.

“蜡烛表明了这一点,”福尔摩斯说。

“Exactly. The candle, which was a new one, is not burned more than half an inch. He must have placed it on the table before he was attacked; otherwise, of course, it would have fallen when he fell. This shows that he was not attacked the instant that he entered the room. When Mr. Barker arrived the candle was lit and the lamp was out.”

“没错。这支蜡烛是新的，燃烧不超过半英寸。他一定是在被袭击之前把它放在桌子上的，否则，当然，当他摔倒的时候，它就会掉下来。这表明他一进入房间就没有受到攻击。巴克先生到的时候，蜡烛点着了，灯也灭了。”

“That's all clear enough.”

“这一切都很清楚。”

“Well, now, we can reconstruct things on those lines. Mr. Douglas enters the room. He puts down the candle. A man appears from behind the curtain. He is armed with this gun. He demands the wedding ring—Heaven only knows why, but so it must have been. Mr. Douglas gave it up. Then either in cold blood or in the course of a struggle—Douglas may have gripped the hammer that was found upon the mat—he shot Douglas in this horrible way. He dropped his gun and also it would seem this queer card—V. V. 341, whatever that may mean—and he made his escape through the window and across the moat at the very moment when Cecil Barker was discovering the crime. How's that, Mr. Holmes?”

“嗯，现在，我们可以在这些线上重建东西。道格拉斯先生走进房间。他放下蜡烛。一个男人从帘子后面出现。他带着这把枪。他要求得到结婚戒指ーー天知道为什么，但一定是这样。道格拉斯先生放弃了。然后，不管是冷血的还是在挣扎的过程中ーー道格拉斯可能握着垫子上发现的锤子ーー他用这种可怕的方式射杀了道格拉斯。他把枪掉在地上，看起来也像是一张奇怪的牌。V. 341，不管这意味着什么ーー就在塞西尔 · 巴克发现罪行的那一刻，他从窗户逃了出去，越过护城河逃了出去。怎么样，福尔摩斯先生?”

“Very interesting, but just a little unconvincing.”

“非常有趣，但是有点难以置信。”

“Man, it would be absolute nonsense if it wasn't that anything else is even worse!” cried MacDonald. “Somebody killed the man, and whoever it was I could clearly prove to you that he should have done it some other way. What does he mean by allowing his retreat to be cut off like that? What does he mean by using a shotgun when silence was his one chance of escape? Come, Mr. Holmes, it's up to you to give us a lead, since you say Mr. White Mason's theory is unconvincing.”

“伙计，如果没有其他事情更糟糕的话，那就是胡说八道了!”麦克唐纳喊道。“有人杀了那个人，不管是谁，我可以清楚地向你证明，他应该用别的方法杀人。他让他的退路被这样切断是什么意思？当沉默是他逃跑的唯一机会时，他用猎枪是什么意思？来吧，福尔摩斯先生，既然你说怀特 · 梅森先生的理论不能令人信服，就该由你来给我们指点一下了。”

Holmes had sat intently observant during this long discussion, missing no word that was said, with his keen eyes darting to right and to left, and his forehead wrinkled with speculation.

在这长时间的讨论中，福尔摩斯一直专注地坐在那里，没有漏掉任何一个字，他敏锐的眼睛左顾右盼，前额因思考而皱起来。

“I should like a few more facts before I get so far as a theory, Mr. Mac,” said he, kneeling down beside the body. “Dear me! these injuries are really appalling. Can we have the butler in for a moment? … Ames, I understand that you have often seen this very unusual mark—a branded triangle inside a circle—upon Mr. Douglas's forearm?”

“在我得出一个理论之前，我还需要更多的事实，麦克先生,”他跪在尸体旁边说。“天哪！这些伤口真的很可怕。管家能进来一下吗？... ... 艾姆斯，我知道你经常在道格拉斯先生的前臂上看到这个非同寻常的标记ーー一个圈内的三角形烙印?”

“Frequently, sir.”

“经常，先生。”

“You never heard any speculation as to what it meant?”

“你从来没有听到过任何关于它意味着什么的猜测吗?”

“No, sir.”

“没有，先生。”

“It must have caused great pain when it was inflicted. It is undoubtedly a burn. Now, I observe, Ames, that there is a small piece of plaster at the angle of Mr. Douglas's jaw. Did you observe that in life?”

“当它被施加的时候，一定造成了巨大的痛苦。毫无疑问，这是一次烧伤。现在，我注意到，艾姆斯，在道格拉斯先生下巴的角上有一小块灰泥。你在生活中观察到了吗?”

“Yes, sir, he cut himself in shaving yesterday morning.”

“是的，先生，他昨天早上刮胡子时割伤了自己。”

“Did you ever know him to cut himself in shaving before?”

“你以前知道他刮胡子时会割伤自己吗?”

“Not for a very long time, sir.”

“不会很久了，先生。”

“Suggestive!” said Holmes. “It may, of course, be a mere coincidence, or it may point to some nervousness which would indicate that he had reason to apprehend danger. Had you noticed anything unusual in his conduct, yesterday, Ames?”

“挑逗!”福尔摩斯说。“当然，这可能仅仅是一个巧合，也可能表明他有某种紧张情绪，表明他有理由担心危险。昨天艾姆斯，你注意到他的行为有什么异常吗?”

“It struck me that he was a little restless and excited, sir.”

“先生，我突然想到他有点不安和兴奋。”

“Ha! The attack may not have been entirely unexpected. We do seem to make a little progress, do we not? Perhaps you would rather do the questioning, Mr. Mac?”

“哈！这次袭击可能并非完全出乎意料。我们似乎确实取得了一些进展，不是吗？麦克先生，也许你更愿意接受提问?”

“No, Mr. Holmes, it's in better hands than mine.”

“不，福尔摩斯先生，它在比我更好的人手里。”

“Well, then, we will pass to this card—V. V. 341. It is rough cardboard. Have you any of the sort in the house?”

”“好吧，那么，我们就把这张牌—— v。第341节。这是一种粗糙的纸板。你家里有这样的人吗?”

“I don't think so.”

“我不这么认为。”

Holmes walked across to the desk and dabbed a little ink from each bottle on to the blotting paper. “It was not printed in this room,” he said; “this is black ink and the other purplish. It was done by a thick pen, and these are fine. No, it was done elsewhere, I should say. Can you make anything of the inscription, Ames?”

福尔摩斯走到书桌前，在吸墨纸上涂了一点墨水。“这不是在这个房间里印的,”他说，“这是黑墨水，其他的是紫色的。这是用一支粗钢笔写的，这些都很好。不，应该说是在别的地方做的。艾姆斯，你能把这上面的字刻出什么来吗?”

“No, sir, nothing.”

“没有，先生，什么都没有。”

“What do you think, Mr. Mac?”

“你怎么看，麦克先生?”

“It gives me the impression of a secret society of some sort; the same with his badge upon the forearm.”

“它给我的印象是某种秘密社团，前臂上别着他的徽章。”

“That's my idea, too,” said White Mason.

“这也是我的主意,”怀特 · 梅森说。

“Well, we can adopt it as a working hypothesis and then see how far our difficulties disappear. An agent from such a society makes his way into the house, waits for Mr. Douglas, blows his head nearly off with this weapon, and escapes by wading the moat, after leaving a card beside the dead man, which will when mentioned in the papers, tell other members of the society that vengeance has been done. That all hangs together. But why this gun, of all weapons?”

“嗯，我们可以把它作为一个可行的假设，然后看看我们的困难消失了多远。一个来自这样一个社会的特工进入房子，等待道格拉斯先生，用这把武器几乎把他的头打爆，然后在死者身边留下一张卡片，通过涉水逃跑，这张卡片在报纸上提到时，会告诉社会上的其他成员复仇已经完成。这一切都紧密联系在一起。但为什么偏偏是这把枪，偏偏是这种武器?”

“Exactly.”

“没错。”

“And why the missing ring?”

“为什么丢了戒指?”

“Quite so.”

“的确如此。”

“And why no arrest? It's past two now. I take it for granted that since dawn every constable within forty miles has been looking out for a wet stranger?”

”“为什么不逮捕他？已经两点多了。我理所当然地认为，从天亮开始，方圆四十英里内的每个警察都在寻找一个湿漉漉的陌生人?”

“That is so, Mr. Holmes.”

“是的，福尔摩斯先生。”

“Well, unless he has a burrow close by or a change of clothes ready, they can hardly miss him. And yet they have missed him up to now!” Holmes had gone to the window and was examining with his lens the blood mark on the sill. “It is clearly the tread of a shoe. It is remarkably broad; a splay-foot, one would say. Curious, because, so far as one can trace any footmark in this mud-stained corner, one would say it was a more shapely sole. However, they are certainly very indistinct. What's this under the side table?”

“嗯，除非他在附近有一个洞穴，或者准备好换洗的衣服，否则他们很难找到他。可是他们到现在还没有找到他!”福尔摩斯走到窗前，用镜头检查窗台上的血迹。“很明显，这是一只鞋的脚印。它非常宽阔，可以说是一只张开的脚。真奇怪，因为在这泥泞的角落里，只要能找到任何足迹，就会说这是一只更匀称的鞋底。然而，它们当然是非常模糊的。桌子下面是什么?”

“Mr. Douglas's dumb-bells,” said Ames.

“道格拉斯先生的哑铃,”艾姆斯说。

“Dumb-bell—there's only one. Where's the other?”

“哑铃——只有一个，另一个呢?”

“I don't know, Mr. Holmes. There may have been only one. I have not noticed them for months.”

“我不知道，福尔摩斯先生。可能只有一个。我已经好几个月没注意到他们了。”

“One dumb-bell—” Holmes said seriously; but his remarks were interrupted by a sharp knock at the door.

“一个哑铃——”福尔摩斯严肃地说，但他的话被一阵敲门声打断了。

A tall, sunburned, capable-looking, clean-shaved man looked in at us. I had no difficulty in guessing that it was the Cecil Barker of whom I had heard. His masterful eyes travelled quickly with a questioning glance from face to face.

一个身材高大、晒得黑黑的、看上去干净利落、刮得干干净净的男人朝我们望了一眼。我毫不费力地猜出那就是塞西尔 · 巴克尔，我听说过他。他那双熟练的眼睛带着疑问的目光迅速地扫视了一下。

“Sorry to interrupt your consultation,” said he, “but you should hear the latest news.”

“很抱歉打断你们的磋商,”他说，“但你们应该听听最新的消息。”

“An arrest?”

“逮捕?”

“No such luck. But they've found his bicycle. The fellow left his bicycle behind him. Come and have a look. It is within a hundred yards of the hall door.”

“没有这么幸运。但是他们找到了他的自行车。那家伙把自行车忘在身后了。过来看看。它离门厅不到一百码。”

We found three or four grooms and idlers standing in the drive inspecting a bicycle which had been drawn out from a clump of evergreens in which it had been concealed. It was a well used Rudge-Whitworth, splashed as from a considerable journey. There was a saddlebag with spanner and oilcan, but no clue as to the owner.

我们看见三四个马夫和闲人站在车道上检查一辆自行车，这辆自行车是从一丛常青树中拖出来的，藏在那里面。这是一辆用得很好的 Rudge-Whitworth 牌汽车，从相当长的旅途中溅起的水花。有一个装着扳手和油罐的鞍囊，但是没有找到主人的线索。

“It would be a grand help to the police,” said the inspector, “if these things were numbered and registered. But we must be thankful for what we've got. If we can't find where he went to, at least we are likely to get where he came from. But what in the name of all that is wonderful made the fellow leave it behind? And how in the world has he got away without it? We don't seem to get a gleam of light in the case, Mr. Holmes.”

“如果这些东西被编号和登记的话,”巡官说，“对警察来说将是极大的帮助。”。但是我们必须感谢我们所拥有的。如果我们找不到他去了哪里，至少我们可以找到他来的地方。但是，究竟是什么原因让这个家伙把它抛在脑后呢？没有它他怎么能活下来呢？福尔摩斯先生，我们在这件案子上似乎一点头绪都没有。”

“Don't we?” my friend answered thoughtfully. “I wonder!”

“不是吗?”我的朋友若有所思地回答。“我想知道!”
