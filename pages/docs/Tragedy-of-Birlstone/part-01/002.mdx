  title: "Chapter II. Sherlock Holmes Discourses 论述",
  book: "The Tragedy of Birlstone"
}

It was one of those dramatic moments for which my friend existed. It would be an overstatement to say that he was shocked or even excited by the amazing announcement. Without having a tinge of cruelty in his singular composition, he was undoubtedly callous from long over-stimulation. Yet, if his emotions were dulled, his intellectual perceptions were exceedingly active. There was no trace then of the horror which I had myself felt at this curt declaration; but his face showed rather the quiet and interested composure of the chemist who sees the crystals falling into position from his oversaturated solution.

这是我的朋友存在的那些戏剧性的时刻之一。如果说他对这个惊人的消息感到震惊甚至兴奋，那未免言过其实。在他的独特作品中没有一点残酷的色彩，他无疑对长期的过度刺激冷酷无情。然而，如果他的情绪变得迟钝，他的智力知觉就会非常活跃。当时我自己对这个简短的声明感到的恐惧没有丝毫痕迹; 但是他的脸上显示出化学家那种宁静而有趣的镇静，他看到晶体从他的过饱和溶液中落到适当的位置。

“Remarkable!” said he. “Remarkable!”

“不可思议!”他说。“不可思议!”

“You don't seem surprised.”

“你看起来并不惊讶。”

“Interested, Mr. Mac, but hardly surprised. Why should I be surprised? I receive an anonymous communication from a quarter which I know to be important, warning me that danger threatens a certain person. Within an hour I learn that this danger has actually materialized and that the person is dead. I am interested; but, as you observe, I am not surprised.”

“我很感兴趣，麦克先生，但并不感到意外。我为什么要惊讶呢？我收到一封匿名信，来自一个我知道很重要的地方，警告我危险正在威胁某个人。不到一个小时，我就知道这个危险实际上已经发生了，那个人已经死了。我很感兴趣，但是，正如你所看到的，我并不感到奇怪。”

In a few short sentences he explained to the inspector the facts about the letter and the cipher. MacDonald sat with his chin on his hands and his great sandy eyebrows bunched into a yellow tangle.

他用几句简短的话向检查员解释了关于信和密码的事实。麦克唐纳用手托着下巴坐着，他那粗大的沙色眉毛卷成一团黄色。

“I was going down to Birlstone this morning,” said he. “I had come to ask you if you cared to come with me—you and your friend here. But from what you say we might perhaps be doing better work in London.”

“我今天早上要去 Birlstone,”他说。”“我是来问你是否愿意和我一起走ーー你和你的朋友。但从你所说的来看，我们在伦敦的工作可能会做得更好。”

“I rather think not,” said Holmes.

“我倒不这么认为,”福尔摩斯说。

“Hang it all, Mr. Holmes!” cried the inspector. “The papers will be full of the Birlstone mystery in a day or two; but where's the mystery if there is a man in London who prophesied the crime before ever it occurred? We have only to lay our hands on that man, and the rest will follow.”

“该死，福尔摩斯先生!”巡查员喊道。“再过一两天，报纸上就会充斥着伯尔斯通的神秘事件了; 但是，如果伦敦有一个人在犯罪发生之前就预言了犯罪，那么这个神秘事件又在哪里呢？我们只要把手放在那个人身上，其他人就会跟着来。”

“No doubt, Mr. Mac. But how do you propose to lay your hands on the so-called Porlock?”

“毫无疑问，麦克先生。但是你打算怎么把你的手放在所谓的波洛克上呢?”

MacDonald turned over the letter which Holmes had handed him. “Posted in Camberwell—that doesn't help us much. Name, you say, is assumed. Not much to go on, certainly. Didn't you say that you have sent him money?”

麦克唐纳把福尔摩斯递给他的那封信交给了他。“发布在坎伯韦尔(camberwell)——这对我们没有多大帮助。你说，名字是假定的。当然，没什么可查的。你不是说你给他寄过钱吗?”

“Twice.”

“两次。”

“And how?”

“怎么做?”

“In notes to Camberwell post-office.”

“在给坎伯威尔邮局的便条上。”

“Did you ever trouble to see who called for them?”

“你有没有想过是谁叫他们来的?”

“No.”

“没有。”

The inspector looked surprised and a little shocked. “Why not?”

检查员看上去很惊讶，有点吃惊。“为什么不呢?”

“Because I always keep faith. I had promised when he first wrote that I would not try to trace him.”

“因为我一直信守诺言。在他第一次写信时，我就承诺过不会追查他的下落。”

“You think there is someone behind him?”

“你觉得他后面有人吗?”

“I know there is.”

“我知道有。”

“This professor that I've heard you mention?”

“我听你提起过的那个教授?”

“Exactly!”

“没错!”

Inspector MacDonald smiled, and his eyelid quivered as he glanced towards me. “I won't conceal from you, Mr. Holmes, that we think in the C. I. D. that you have a wee bit of a bee in your bonnet over this professor. I made some inquiries myself about the matter. He seems to be a very respectable, learned, and talented sort of man.”

麦克唐纳督察微笑着，他向我瞥了一眼，眼皮发抖。“福尔摩斯先生，我不想对你隐瞒，我们认为你对这位教授有点不正常的想法。关于这件事，我自己做了一些调查。他似乎是一个受人尊敬的、博学的、有才华的人。”

“I'm glad you've got so far as to recognize the talent.”

“我很高兴你们能够认识到这些人才。”

“Man, you can't but recognize it! After I heard your view I made it my business to see him. I had a chat with him on eclipses. How the talk got that way I canna think; but he had out a reflector lantern and a globe, and made it all clear in a minute. He lent me a book; but I don't mind saying that it was a bit above my head, though I had a good Aberdeen upbringing. He'd have made a grand meenister with his thin face and gray hair and solemn-like way of talking. When he put his hand on my shoulder as we were parting, it was like a father's blessing before you go out into the cold, cruel world.”

“伙计，你不能不认识它！听了你的意见后，我决定去见他。我在日食时和他聊过天。我不知道他们的谈话是怎么变成这样的，但他拿出一个反光灯笼和一个地球仪，一会儿就把一切都说清楚了。他借给我一本书，但是我不介意说这有点超出我的理解范围，尽管我在阿伯丁长大。他瘦削的脸，灰白的头发，一本正经的说话方式，一定会成为一个大人物。临别时，他把手搭在我的肩上，仿佛是父亲的祝福，在你走进这个冰冷、残酷的世界之前。”

Holmes chuckled and rubbed his hands. “Great!” he said. “Great! Tell me, Friend MacDonald, this pleasing and touching interview was, I suppose, in the professor's study?”

福尔摩斯咯咯地笑了起来，搓了搓手。“太好了!”他说。“太好了！告诉我，麦克唐纳朋友，我想这次愉快而感人的采访是在教授的书房里进行的吧?”

“That's so.”

“没错。”

“A fine room, is it not?”

“房间不错，是吧?”

“Very fine—very handsome indeed, Mr. Holmes.”

“非常好，非常漂亮，福尔摩斯先生。”

“You sat in front of his writing desk?”

“你坐在他的写字台前?”

“Just so.”

“就是这样。”

“Sun in your eyes and his face in the shadow?”

“阳光照在你的眼睛里，他的脸在阴影里?”

“Well, it was evening; but I mind that the lamp was turned on my face.”

“好吧，那时已经是晚上了，不过我还是介意把灯点在我的脸上。”

“It would be. Did you happen to observe a picture over the professor's head?”

“有可能。你有没有看到教授头顶上的一幅画?”

“I don't miss much, Mr. Holmes. Maybe I learned that from you. Yes, I saw the picture—a young woman with her head on her hands, peeping at you sideways.”

“我没有错过什么，福尔摩斯先生。也许我是从你身上学到的。是的，我看到了那张照片——一个年轻的女人把头放在手上，从侧面偷看你。”

“That painting was by Jean Baptiste Greuze.”

“那幅画是让-巴蒂斯·热鲁兹的。”

The inspector endeavoured to look interested.

检查员努力装出很感兴趣的样子。

“Jean Baptiste Greuze,” Holmes continued, joining his finger tips and leaning well back in his chair, “was a French artist who flourished between the years 1750 and 1800. I allude, of course to his working career. Modern criticism has more than indorsed the high opinion formed of him by his contemporaries.”

“让-巴蒂斯·热鲁兹是一位活跃于1750年至1800年之间的法国艺术家。当然，我指的是他的职业生涯。现代批评家对他的评价远远超过了同时代人对他的高度评价。”

The inspector's eyes grew abstracted. “Hadn't we better—” he said.

巡查员的眼神变得茫然起来。“我们不是应该——”他说。

“We are doing so,” Holmes interrupted. “All that I am saying has a very direct and vital bearing upon what you have called the Birlstone Mystery. In fact, it may in a sense be called the very centre of it.”

“我们正在这样做,”福尔摩斯打断了他。“我所说的一切与你们所说的伯尔斯通之谜有着非常直接和重要的关系。事实上，在某种意义上，它可以被称为这场危机的核心。”

MacDonald smiled feebly, and looked appealingly to me. “Your thoughts move a bit too quick for me, Mr. Holmes. You leave out a link or two, and I can't get over the gap. What in the whole wide world can be the connection between this dead painting man and the affair at Birlstone?”

麦克唐纳无力地笑了笑，恳求地看着我。“福尔摩斯先生，你的想法对我来说有点太快了。如果你漏掉一两个链接，我就无法克服这个差距。这个死去的画人和伯尔斯通的事情究竟有什么关系呢?”

“All knowledge comes useful to the detective,” remarked Holmes. “Even the trivial fact that in the year 1865 a picture by Greuze entitled La Jeune Fille a l'Agneau fetched one million two hundred thousand francs—more than forty thousand pounds—at the Portalis sale may start a train of reflection in your mind.”

“所有的知识对侦探都是有用的,”福尔摩斯说。“1865年，格鲁泽的一幅名为《青春的女儿》的画在波特里斯拍卖会上卖出了一百二十万法郎(超过四万英镑) ，即使是这样一个微不足道的事实，也可能会在你的脑海中引起一连串的反思。”

It was clear that it did. The inspector looked honestly interested.

很明显是这样的。检查员看起来真的很感兴趣。

“I may remind you,” Holmes continued, “that the professor's salary can be ascertained in several trustworthy books of reference. It is seven hundred a year.”

“我可以提醒你,”福尔摩斯继续说道，“教授的工资可以在几本值得信赖的参考书中查明。一年七百。”

“Then how could he buy—”

”那他怎么能买...”

“Quite so! How could he?”

“确实如此! 他怎么能这样呢?”

“Ay, that's remarkable,” said the inspector thoughtfully. “Talk away, Mr. Holmes. I'm just loving it. It's fine!”

“啊，真了不起,”巡查员若有所思地说。“继续说吧，福尔摩斯先生。我很喜欢它。它很好!”

Holmes smiled. He was always warmed by genuine admiration—the characteristic of the real artist. “What about Birlstone?” he asked.

福尔摩斯笑了。他总是被真正的钦佩所感动——这是真正艺术家的特点。“伯尔斯通怎么样?”他问。

“We've time yet,” said the inspector, glancing at his watch. “I've a cab at the door, and it won't take us twenty minutes to Victoria. But about this picture: I thought you told me once, Mr. Holmes, that you had never met Professor Moriarty.”

“我们还有时间呢,”巡查员说着，瞥了一眼他的表。“我在门口叫了一辆出租车，到维多利亚不需要二十分钟。但是关于这张照片，我想你曾经告诉过我，Holmes 先生，你从来没有见过詹姆斯·莫里亚蒂教授

“No, I never have.”

“没有，从来没有。”

“Then how do you know about his rooms?”

“那你怎么知道他的房间?”

“Ah, that's another matter. I have been three times in his rooms, twice waiting for him under different pretexts and leaving before he came. Once—well, I can hardly tell about the once to an official detective. It was on the last occasion that I took the liberty of running over his papers—with the most unexpected results.”

“啊，那又是另一回事了。我三次去他的房间，两次以不同的借口等他，在他来之前就离开了。有一次——嗯，我几乎不能把这一次告诉官方的侦探。就在最后一次，我冒昧地浏览了他的论文，得到了最出乎意料的结果。”

“You found something compromising?”

“你发现了什么不妥协的地方?”

“Absolutely nothing. That was what amazed me. However, you have now seen the point of the picture. It shows him to be a very wealthy man. How did he acquire wealth? He is unmarried. His younger brother is a station master in the west of England. His chair is worth seven hundred a year. And he owns a Greuze.”

“绝对没有。这让我很吃惊。然而，你现在已经看到了图片的要点。这表明他是一个非常富有的人。他是怎样获得财富的？他未婚。他的弟弟是英格兰西部的一名站长。他的椅子一年值七百英镑。他还有一辆格鲁泽。”

“Well?”

“嗯?”

“Surely the inference is plain.”

“当然，这个推论很明显。”

“You mean that he has a great income and that he must earn it in an illegal fashion?”

“你的意思是，他有很多收入，而且他必须以非法的方式赚钱?”

“Exactly. Of course I have other reasons for thinking so—dozens of exiguous threads which lead vaguely up towards the centre of the web where the poisonous, motionless creature is lurking. I only mention the Greuze because it brings the matter within the range of your own observation.”

“没错。当然，我这样想还有其他原因——数十根细小的线条隐约地通向网的中心，而这个有毒的、静止的生物正潜伏在那里。我之所以提到格鲁泽，是因为它把这个问题纳入了你自己的观察范围。”

“Well, Mr. Holmes, I admit that what you say is interesting: it's more than interesting—it's just wonderful. But let us have it a little clearer if you can. Is it forgery, coining, burglary—where does the money come from?”

”“好吧，福尔摩斯先生，我承认你说的话很有意思，不仅仅是有意思，简直太棒了。但是如果可以的话，让我们说得更清楚一点。是伪造、造假、盗窃吗? 这些钱是从哪里来的?”

“Have you ever read of Jonathan Wild?”

“你读过乔纳森 · 怀尔德的书吗?”

“Well, the name has a familiar sound. Someone in a novel, was he not? I don't take much stock of detectives in novels—chaps that do things and never let you see how they do them. That's just inspiration: not business.”

“嗯，这个名字听起来很熟悉。小说里的人物，不是吗？我对小说中的侦探没有太多的了解，那些小说中的侦探做事从不让你看到他们是怎么做的。这只是灵感，而不是商业。”

“Jonathan Wild wasn't a detective, and he wasn't in a novel. He was a master criminal, and he lived last century—1750 or thereabouts.”

“乔纳森 · 怀尔德不是侦探，他也不在小说里。他是一个犯罪大师，生活在上个世纪ーー1750年左右.”

“Then he's no use to me. I'm a practical man.”

“那他对我就没用了，我是个讲求实际的人。”

“Mr. Mac, the most practical thing that you ever did in your life would be to shut yourself up for three months and read twelve hours a day at the annals of crime. Everything comes in circles—even Professor Moriarty. Jonathan Wild was the hidden force of the London criminals, to whom he sold his brains and his organization on a fifteen per cent commission. The old wheel turns, and the same spoke comes up. It's all been done before, and will be again. I'll tell you one or two things about Moriarty which may interest you.”

“麦克先生，你这辈子做过的最实际的事情就是把自己关起来三个月，每天读十二个小时的犯罪史。一切都是循环往复---- 甚至是詹姆斯·莫里亚蒂教授。乔纳森 · 怀尔德是伦敦罪犯的幕后黑手，他以百分之十五的佣金将自己的头脑和组织卖给了他们。旧轮子转动起来，同样的轮辐出现了。这一切都曾经发生过，而且将来还会发生。我会告诉你一两件关于莫里亚蒂的事，你可能会感兴趣。”

“You'll interest me, right enough.”

“你会引起我的兴趣的，没错。”

“I happen to know who is the first link in his chain—a chain with this Napoleon-gone-wrong at one end, and a hundred broken fighting men, pickpockets, blackmailers, and card sharpers at the other, with every sort of crime in between. His chief of staff is Colonel Sebastian Moran, as aloof and guarded and inaccessible to the law as himself. What do you think he pays him?”

“我碰巧知道谁是他这条链子的第一环——这条链子的一端是这个拿破仑走错的链子，另一端是一百个身心俱疲的战士、扒手、勒索者和骗牌者，中间夹杂着各种各样的犯罪。他的幕僚长是赛巴斯丁·莫兰，和他一样冷漠，戒备森严，无法接近法律。你觉得他付给他多少钱?”

“I'd like to hear.”

“我想听听。”

“Six thousand a year. That's paying for brains, you see—the American business principle. I learned that detail quite by chance. It's more than the Prime Minister gets. That gives you an idea of Moriarty's gains and of the scale on which he works. Another point: I made it my business to hunt down some of Moriarty's checks lately—just common innocent checks that he pays his household bills with. They were drawn on six different banks. Does that make any impression on your mind?”

“一年六千。你看，这就是花钱买智慧ーー美国的商业原则。我很偶然地学到了那个细节。比首相得到的还要多。这让你对莫里亚蒂的成就和他的工作规模有了一个大概的了解。还有一点: 最近，我的工作就是追查莫里亚蒂的一些支票——只是他用来支付家庭账单的普通无辜的支票。他们是从六家不同的银行提取的。这会给你留下什么印象吗?”

“Queer, certainly! But what do you gather from it?”

“当然是同性恋! 但你从中得到了什么呢?”

“That he wanted no gossip about his wealth. No single man should know what he had. I have no doubt that he has twenty banking accounts; the bulk of his fortune abroad in the Deutsche Bank or the Credit Lyonnais as likely as not. Sometime when you have a year or two to spare I commend to you the study of Professor Moriarty.”

“他不想听到关于他的财富的闲言碎语。没有一个人应该知道他拥有什么。我毫不怀疑他有二十个银行帐户，他在国外的大部分财产很可能在德意志银行或里昂信贷银行。当你有一两年的空闲时间时，我向你推荐对詹姆斯·莫里亚蒂教授的研究

Inspector MacDonald had grown steadily more impressed as the conversation proceeded. He had lost himself in his interest. Now his practical Scotch intelligence brought him back with a snap to the matter in hand.

随着谈话的进行，麦克唐纳督察的印象越来越深刻。他失去了自己的兴趣。现在，他那实际的苏格兰人的智慧使他回到了手头的事情上。

“He can keep, anyhow,” said he. “You've got us side-tracked with your interesting anecdotes, Mr. Holmes. What really counts is your remark that there is some connection between the professor and the crime. That you get from the warning received through the man Porlock. Can we for our present practical needs get any further than that?”

“不管怎样，他可以留下来,”他说。“福尔摩斯先生，你那些有趣的轶事让我们分心了。真正重要的是你说教授和犯罪之间有某种联系。你从波洛克那里得到的警告。就我们目前的实际需要而言，我们还能再进一步吗?”

“We may form some conception as to the motives of the crime. It is, as I gather from your original remarks, an inexplicable, or at least an unexplained, murder. Now, presuming that the source of the crime is as we suspect it to be, there might be two different motives. In the first place, I may tell you that Moriarty rules with a rod of iron over his people. His discipline is tremendous. There is only one punishment in his code. It is death. Now we might suppose that this murdered man—this Douglas whose approaching fate was known by one of the arch-criminal's subordinates—had in some way betrayed the chief. His punishment followed, and would be known to all—if only to put the fear of death into them.”

“我们可以对犯罪的动机形成一些概念。我从你最初的言论中推断，这是一起无法解释的，至少是无法解释的谋杀案。现在，假设犯罪的来源正如我们所怀疑的那样，可能有两种不同的动机。首先，我可以告诉你莫里亚蒂用铁棒统治着他的人民。他的纪律非常严明。在他的法典里只有一种惩罚。这就是死亡。现在我们可以假设，这个被谋杀的人ーー这个道格拉斯，他的命运已经被主犯的一个下属知道ーー在某种程度上背叛了首领。他的惩罚随之而来，而且将会众所周知——只要能让他们感到死亡的恐惧。”

“Well, that is one suggestion, Mr. Holmes.”

“嗯，这是一个建议，福尔摩斯先生。”

“The other is that it has been engineered by Moriarty in the ordinary course of business. Was there any robbery?”

“另一个原因是，这是莫里亚蒂在正常业务过程中策划的。有没有发生过抢劫?”

“I have not heard.”

“我没听说。”

“If so, it would, of course, be against the first hypothesis and in favour of the second. Moriarty may have been engaged to engineer it on a promise of part spoils, or he may have been paid so much down to manage it. Either is possible. But whichever it may be, or if it is some third combination, it is down at Birlstone that we must seek the solution. I know our man too well to suppose that he has left anything up here which may lead us to him.”

“如果是这样的话，当然就违背了第一种假设，而支持第二种假设。莫里亚蒂可能是受雇策划这个项目，并承诺从中分一杯羹，或者他可能收了很多钱来管理这个项目。任何一种都是可能的。但不管是哪种情况，或者是第三种情况，我们必须在 Birlstone 寻找解决方案。我太了解我们的人了，我不认为他留下了什么东西可以让我们找到他。”

“Then to Birlstone we must go!” cried MacDonald, jumping from his chair. “My word! it's later than I thought. I can give you, gentlemen, five minutes for preparation, and that is all.”

“那么我们必须去 Birlstone!”麦克唐纳从椅子上跳起来喊道。“我的天哪！比我想象的要晚。先生们，我可以给你们五分钟准备时间，仅此而已。”

“And ample for us both,” said Holmes, as he sprang up and hastened to change from his dressing gown to his coat. “While we are on our way, Mr. Mac, I will ask you to be good enough to tell me all about it.”

“对我们俩来说也够了,”福尔摩斯说着跳了起来，赶紧把睡袍换上外套。“在我们上路的时候，麦克先生，我请求你好心告诉我一切。”

“All about it” proved to be disappointingly little, and yet there was enough to assure us that the case before us might well be worthy of the expert's closest attention. He brightened and rubbed his thin hands together as he listened to the meagre but remarkable details. A long series of sterile weeks lay behind us, and here at last there was a fitting object for those remarkable powers which, like all special gifts, become irksome to their owner when they are not in use. That razor brain blunted and rusted with inaction.

“关于它的一切”被证明是令人失望的少，但有足够的证据向我们保证，我们面前的案件很可能值得专家的密切关注。当他听到那些贫乏但引人注目的细节时，他高兴地搓着瘦弱的双手。我们已经度过了一个漫长而枯燥的星期，这里终于有了一个合适的东西，可以用来装饰那些非凡的力量，就像所有的特殊天赋一样，当它们不再使用的时候，就会让它们的主人感到厌烦。那剃刀般的大脑迟钝了，锈迹斑斑。

Sherlock Holmes's eyes glistened, his pale cheeks took a warmer hue, and his whole eager face shone with an inward light when the call for work reached him. Leaning forward in the cab, he listened intently to MacDonald's short sketch of the problem which awaited us in Sussex. The inspector was himself dependent, as he explained to us, upon a scribbled account forwarded to him by the milk train in the early hours of the morning. White Mason, the local officer, was a personal friend, and hence MacDonald had been notified much more promptly than is usual at Scotland Yard when provincials need their assistance. It is a very cold scent upon which the Metropolitan expert is generally asked to run.

夏洛克 · 福尔摩斯的眼睛闪闪发光，他苍白的脸颊泛出一层暖色调，当工作的召唤传到他的耳朵里时，他整个热切的脸上闪耀着内心的光芒。在驾驶室里，他身体前倾，专心地听着麦克唐纳简短地描述在苏塞克斯等待着我们的问题。正如他向我们解释的那样，检查员本人也是依赖于一份凌晨乘运牛奶的火车送来的潦草的报告。当地警官怀特 · 梅森是麦克唐纳的私人朋友，所以当地方警察需要帮助的时候，麦克唐纳比通常在伦敦警察厅得到了更及时的通知。这是一个非常冷的气味，大都会的专家通常被要求运行。

“Dear Inspector MacDonald [said the letter which he read to us]:

“尊敬的麦克唐纳督察(在给我们读的信中说道) :

“Official requisition for your services is in separate envelope. This is for your private eye. Wire me what train in the morning you can get for Birlstone, and I will meet it—or have it met if I am too occupied. This case is a snorter. Don't waste a moment in getting started. If you can bring Mr. Holmes, please do so; for he will find something after his own heart. We would think the whole thing had been fixed up for theatrical effect if there wasn't a dead man in the middle of it. My word! it is a snorter.“

”有关你服务的正式申请单在另一个信封里。这是给你私家侦探的。给我发电报，告诉我你明天早上可以搭哪班火车去伯尔斯通，我就去迎接火车ーー如果我太忙的话，就去迎接火车。这种情况下是一种打鼾。不要浪费时间开始。如果你能把福尔摩斯先生带来，请一定带来，因为他会找到自己喜欢的东西的。如果中间没有一个死人的话，我们会认为整个事情都是为了戏剧效果而安排好的。我的天！这是一个呼吸器。“

“Your friend seems to be no fool,” remarked Holmes.

“你的朋友似乎不是傻瓜,”福尔摩斯说。

“No, sir, White Mason is a very live man, if I am any judge.”

“不，先生，如果要我说的话，怀特 · 梅森是个活生生的人。”

“Well, have you anything more?”

“那么，你还有别的什么吗?”

“Only that he will give us every detail when we meet.”

“我们见面的时候，他会告诉我们每一个细节。”

“Then how did you get at Mr. Douglas and the fact that he had been horribly murdered?”

“那你是怎么知道道格拉斯先生是被残忍地谋杀的呢?”

“That was in the enclosed official report. It didn't say ‘horrible’: that's not a recognized official term. It gave the name John Douglas. It mentioned that his injuries had been in the head, from the discharge of a shotgun. It also mentioned the hour of the alarm, which was close on to midnight last night. It added that the case was undoubtedly one of murder, but that no arrest had been made, and that the case was one which presented some very perplexing and extraordinary features. That's absolutely all we have at present, Mr. Holmes.”

“这是随函附上的官方报告。它没有说‘可怕’: 这不是一个公认的官方术语。它给了约翰 · 道格拉斯这个名字。它提到他的头部受伤，是由于开枪造成的。它还提到了闹钟的时间，昨晚已经接近午夜了。它补充说，这个案件无疑是一起谋杀案，但没有逮捕任何人，这个案件呈现出一些非常令人困惑和不寻常的特点。福尔摩斯先生，我们目前只有这些了。”

“Then, with your permission, we will leave it at that, Mr. Mac. The temptation to form premature theories upon insufficient data is the bane of our profession. I can see only two things for certain at present—a great brain in London, and a dead man in Sussex. It's the chain between that we are going to trace.”

“那么，如果你允许的话，我们就不谈这个了，麦克先生。在数据不足的情况下形成不成熟的理论的诱惑是我们这个行业的祸根。目前我能确定的只有两件事: 伦敦的一个伟大的大脑和苏塞克斯的一个死人。这是我们要追踪的两者之间的链条。”
