  title: "Chapter VI. A Dawning Light 曙光初露",
  book: "The Tragedy of Birlstone"
}


The three detectives had many matters of detail into which to inquire; so I returned alone to our modest quarters at the village inn. But before doing so I took a stroll in the curious old-world garden which flanked the house. Rows of very ancient yew trees cut into strange designs girded it round. Inside was a beautiful stretch of lawn with an old sundial in the middle, the whole effect so soothing and restful that it was welcome to my somewhat jangled nerves.

这三个侦探有许多细节问题需要调查，所以我独自回到我们在乡村客栈的简陋住处。但是在这之前，我在房子两侧古怪的旧世界花园里散步。一排排古老的紫杉被砍成奇怪的图案，把它围了起来。里面是一片美丽的草坪，中间有一个古老的日晷，整个效果如此舒缓和宁静，让我有点紧张。

In that deeply peaceful atmosphere one could forget, or remember only as some fantastic nightmare, that darkened study with the sprawling, bloodstained figure on the floor. And yet, as I strolled round it and tried to steep my soul in its gentle balm, a strange incident occurred, which brought me back to the tragedy and left a sinister impression in my mind.

在那种深深的平静气氛中，人们可能会忘记，或者只记得一些梦幻般的噩梦，书房里的地板上躺着一个庞大的、血迹斑斑的身影。然而，当我漫步在它周围，试图将我的灵魂浸泡在它温和的香膏中时，一件奇怪的事情发生了，它把我带回了那场悲剧，并在我的脑海中留下了一个邪恶的印象。

I have said that a decoration of yew trees circled the garden. At the end farthest from the house they thickened into a continuous hedge. On the other side of this hedge, concealed from the eyes of anyone approaching from the direction of the house, there was a stone seat. As I approached the spot I was aware of voices, some remark in the deep tones of a man, answered by a little ripple of feminine laughter.

我说过，花园周围有一圈紫杉树。在离房子最远的尽头，它们变厚成了一道连续不断的篱笆。在树篱的另一边，有一个石头的座位，从房子的方向走来的人都看不见。当我走近那个地方的时候，我注意到有人在说话，一些男人深沉的话语，回答我的是一阵女人的笑声。

An instant later I had come round the end of the hedge and my eyes lit upon Mrs. Douglas and the man Barker before they were aware of my presence. Her appearance gave me a shock. In the dining-room she had been demure and discreet. Now all pretense of grief had passed away from her. Her eyes shone with the joy of living, and her face still quivered with amusement at some remark of her companion. He sat forward, his hands clasped and his forearms on his knees, with an answering smile upon his bold, handsome face. In an instant—but it was just one instant too late—they resumed their solemn masks as my figure came into view. A hurried word or two passed between them, and then Barker rose and came towards me.

过了一会儿，我绕过了篱笆的尽头，我的眼睛在道格拉斯太太和那个叫巴克的人察觉到我的存在之前，已经盯上了他们。她的出现使我大吃一惊。在餐厅里，她一直是端庄而谨慎的。现在她已经不再假装悲伤了。她的眼睛里闪烁着生活的喜悦，她的脸上仍然因为同伴的一句话而笑得发抖。他向前坐着，双手交叉，前臂放在膝盖上，勇敢而英俊的脸上露出了回应的微笑。刹那间——但只是刹那间太晚了——他们又恢复了他们庄严的面具，这时我的身影出现在眼前。他们匆匆说了一两句话，然后巴克站了起来，向我走来。

“Excuse me, sir,” said he, “but am I addressing Dr. Watson?”

“对不起，先生,”他说，“我是在和华生医生说话吗?”

I bowed with a coldness which showed, I dare say, very plainly the impression which had been produced upon my mind.

我冷淡地鞠了一躬，我敢说，这清楚地表明了我心中的印象。

“We thought that it was probably you, as your friendship with Mr. Sherlock Holmes is so well known. Would you mind coming over and speaking to Mrs. Douglas for one instant?”

“我们认为可能是你，因为你和福尔摩斯先生的友谊是众所周知的。你能过来和道格拉斯太太说一会儿话吗?”

I followed him with a dour face. Very clearly I could see in my mind's eye that shattered figure on the floor. Here within a few hours of the tragedy were his wife and his nearest friend laughing together behind a bush in the garden which had been his. I greeted the lady with reserve. I had grieved with her grief in the dining-room. Now I met her appealing gaze with an unresponsive eye.

我一脸严肃地跟着他。很清楚地，我可以在脑海中看到地板上那个破碎的身影。在悲剧发生后的几个小时里，他的妻子和他最亲近的朋友一起在原来属于他的花园里的灌木丛后面大笑。我含蓄地向那位女士打招呼。我在餐厅里为她的悲伤感到难过。现在我用迟钝的眼神看着她那迷人的目光。

“I fear that you think me callous and hard-hearted,” said she.

“我怕你认为我冷酷无情,”她说。

I shrugged my shoulders. “It is no business of mine,” said I.

我耸了耸肩。“这不关我的事,”我说。

“Perhaps some day you will do me justice. If you only realized—”

“也许有一天你会为我伸张正义，只要你意识到——”

“There is no need why Dr. Watson should realize,” said Barker quickly. “As he has himself said, it is no possible business of his.”

“没有必要为什么华生医生应该意识到,”巴克很快说。“正如他自己所说，这不可能是他的事。”

“Exactly,” said I, “and so I will beg leave to resume my walk.”

“没错,”我说，“所以我请求允许我继续散步。”

“One moment, Dr. Watson,” cried the woman in a pleading voice. “There is one question which you can answer with more authority than anyone else in the world, and it may make a very great difference to me. You know Mr. Holmes and his relations with the police better than anyone else can. Supposing that a matter were brought confidentially to his knowledge, is it absolutely necessary that he should pass it on to the detectives?”

“等一下，华生医生,”那个女人用恳求的声音喊道。“有一个问题，你可以比世界上任何人都更有权威地回答，这个问题可能会给我带来很大的不同。你比任何人都更了解福尔摩斯先生和他与警方的关系。假如这件事是秘密地告诉他的，他一定要把它交给侦探吗?”

“Yes, that's it,” said Barker eagerly. “Is he on his own or is he entirely in with them?”

“是的，就是这样,”巴克急切地说，“他是一个人还是完全和他们在一起?”

“I really don't know that I should be justified in discussing such a point.”

“我真的不知道，我讨论这样一个观点是否合理。”

“I beg—I implore that you will, Dr. Watson! I assure you that you will be helping us—helping me greatly if you will guide us on that point.”

”“我恳求——我恳求您，华生医生！我向你保证，如果你能在这一点上指导我们，你将会帮助我们ーー大大地帮助我。”

There was such a ring of sincerity in the woman's voice that for the instant I forgot all about her levity and was moved only to do her will.

那个女人的声音里有一种真诚的感觉，我一下子忘记了她的轻浮，只是为她的意愿而感动。

“Mr. Holmes is an independent investigator,” I said. “He is his own master, and would act as his own judgment directed. At the same time, he would naturally feel loyalty towards the officials who were working on the same case, and he would not conceal from them anything which would help them in bringing a criminal to justice. Beyond this I can say nothing, and I would refer you to Mr. Holmes himself if you wanted fuller information.”

“福尔摩斯先生是一位独立调查员,”我说。“他是自己的主人，会按照自己的判断行事。与此同时，他自然会对处理同一案件的官员表示忠诚，他不会向他们隐瞒任何有助于他们将罪犯绳之以法的事情。除此之外，我什么也不能说，如果你需要更详细的情况，我可以把你介绍给福尔摩斯先生本人。”

So saying I raised my hat and went upon my way, leaving them still seated behind that concealing hedge. I looked back as I rounded the far end of it, and saw that they were still talking very earnestly together, and, as they were gazing after me, it was clear that it was our interview that was the subject of their debate.

于是我举起帽子，让他们仍坐在隐蔽的篱笆后面，继续赶路。我回头看了看，我绕到了尽头，看到他们仍然在一起非常认真地谈话，而且，当他们注视着我的时候，很明显，我们的采访是他们辩论的主题。

“I wish none of their confidences,” said Holmes, when I reported to him what had occurred. He had spent the whole afternoon at the Manor House in consultation with his two colleagues, and returned about five with a ravenous appetite for a high tea which I had ordered for him. “No confidences, Watson; for they are mighty awkward if it comes to an arrest for conspiracy and murder.”

“我不希望他们有任何秘密,”当我向福尔摩斯报告发生的事情时，他说。他整个下午都在庄园里和他的两个同事商量，大约五点钟回来，胃口大开，想喝一杯我为他点的下午茶。“没有秘密，华生，因为如果涉及到以阴谋和谋杀的罪名逮捕他们，他们会非常尴尬的。”

“You think it will come to that?”

“你认为事情会发展到那一步吗?”

He was in his most cheerful and debonair humour. “My dear Watson, when I have exterminated that fourth egg I shall be ready to put you in touch with the whole situation. I don't say that we have fathomed it—far from it—but when we have traced the missing dumb-bell—”

他以他最愉快、最温文尔雅的幽默。“我亲爱的华生，当我消灭了第四个卵子，我就可以让你了解整个情况了。我不是说我们已经摸清了它的底细ーー远远不是这样ーー但是当我们找到那个丢失的哑铃ーー”

“The dumb-bell!”

“哑铃!”

“Dear me, Watson, is it possible that you have not penetrated the fact that the case hangs upon the missing dumb-bell? Well, well, you need not be downcast; for between ourselves I don't think that either Inspector Mac or the excellent local practitioner has grasped the overwhelming importance of this incident. One dumb-bell, Watson! Consider an athlete with one dumb-bell! Picture to yourself the unilateral development, the imminent danger of a spinal curvature. Shocking, Watson, shocking!”

“天哪，华生，难道你还没有弄明白这个箱子挂在那个丢失的哑铃上的事实吗？好吧，好吧，你不必沮丧; 因为我们之间的关系，我不认为麦克督察或当地优秀的医生已经领会了这一事件的巨大重要性。一个哑铃，华生！考虑一个只有一个哑铃的运动员！想象一下你的单侧发育，即将到来的脊柱弯曲的危险。震惊吧，华生，震惊吧!”

He sat with his mouth full of toast and his eyes sparkling with mischief, watching my intellectual entanglement. The mere sight of his excellent appetite was an assurance of success, for I had very clear recollections of days and nights without a thought of food, when his baffled mind had chafed before some problem while his thin, eager features became more attenuated with the asceticism of complete mental concentration. Finally he lit his pipe, and sitting in the inglenook of the old village inn he talked slowly and at random about his case, rather as one who thinks aloud than as one who makes a considered statement.

他满嘴吐司地坐着，眼睛里闪烁着调皮的神情，注视着我的智力纠缠。光是看到他胃口极好就足以证明他成功了，因为我清楚地记得那些日日夜夜不想吃东西的日子，当他那困惑的头脑在某些问题面前发炎时，他那瘦弱而急切的脸庞因为全神贯注的禁欲主义而变得更加憔悴。最后，他点燃了烟斗，坐在乡村老客栈的餐厅里，他慢慢地、随意地谈论着他的案子，不像是一个会自言自语的人，也不像是一个会深思熟虑的人。

“A lie, Watson—a great, big, thumping, obtrusive, uncompromising lie—that's what meets us on the threshold! There is our starting point. The whole story told by Barker is a lie. But Barker's story is corroborated by Mrs. Douglas. Therefore she is lying also. They are both lying, and in a conspiracy. So now we have the clear problem. Why are they lying, and what is the truth which they are trying so hard to conceal? Let us try, Watson, you and I, if we can get behind the lie and reconstruct the truth.

“一个谎言，华生——一个巨大的、巨大的、突兀的、毫不妥协的谎言——这就是我们在门槛上看到的东西！这就是我们的出发点。巴克所讲的全部故事都是谎言。但是巴克尔的说法得到了道格拉斯太太的证实。所以她也在说谎。他们都在撒谎，而且都是同谋。所以现在我们有了一个明确的问题。他们为什么要撒谎，他们极力隐瞒的真相是什么？让我们试试，华生，你和我，如果我们能够在谎言背后重建真相。

“How do I know that they are lying? Because it is a clumsy fabrication which simply could not be true. Consider! According to the story given to us, the assassin had less than a minute after the murder had been committed to take that ring, which was under another ring, from the dead man's finger, to replace the other ring—a thing which he would surely never have done—and to put that singular card beside his victim. I say that this was obviously impossible.

“我怎么知道他们在撒谎？因为这是一个笨拙的捏造，根本不可能是真的。考虑一下！根据给我们的故事，杀手在谋杀案发生后不到一分钟就从死者手指上取下另一枚戒指，换掉另一枚戒指---- 这肯定是他永远不会做的事---- 并把那枚奇特的卡片放在受害者旁边。我说这显然是不可能的。

“You may argue—but I have too much respect for your judgment, Watson, to think that you will do so—that the ring may have been taken before the man was killed. The fact that the candle had been lit only a short time shows that there had been no lengthy interview. Was Douglas, from what we hear of his fearless character, a man who would be likely to give up his wedding ring at such short notice, or could we conceive of his giving it up at all? No, no, Watson, the assassin was alone with the dead man for some time with the lamp lit. Of that I have no doubt at all.

“你可能会说，但是我非常尊重你的判断，华生，我不认为你会这么做，因为这枚戒指可能是在那个人被杀之前就已经被拿走了。事实上，蜡烛只点燃了很短的时间，这表明没有冗长的采访。道格拉斯，从我们所听到的他无所畏惧的性格来看，是一个可能会在这么短的时间内放弃他的结婚戒指的人，还是我们可以想象他会放弃它呢？不，不，华生，刺客和死者单独在一起有一段时间，灯还亮着。对此我毫不怀疑。

“But the gunshot was apparently the cause of death. Therefore the shot must have been fired some time earlier than we are told. But there could be no mistake about such a matter as that. We are in the presence, therefore, of a deliberate conspiracy upon the part of the two people who heard the gunshot—of the man Barker and of the woman Douglas. When on the top of this I am able to show that the blood mark on the windowsill was deliberately placed there by Barker, in order to give a false clue to the police, you will admit that the case grows dark against him.

“但枪击显然是死因。因此，子弹一定是在我们被告知的时间之前发射的。但是这样的事情是不可能出错的。因此，听到枪声的两个人——巴克先生和道格拉斯女士——就在我们面前，这是一个蓄意的阴谋。在此之上，我可以证明窗台上的血迹是巴克故意留下的，为了给警察一个错误的线索，你必须承认这个案子对他不利。

“Now we have to ask ourselves at what hour the murder actually did occur. Up to half-past ten the servants were moving about the house; so it was certainly not before that time. At a quarter to eleven they had all gone to their rooms with the exception of Ames, who was in the pantry. I have been trying some experiments after you left us this afternoon, and I find that no noise which MacDonald can make in the study can penetrate to me in the pantry when the doors are all shut.

“现在我们不得不问问自己，谋杀实际发生在什么时候。直到十点半，仆人们还在房子里走来走去，所以肯定不是在那个时候以前。十一点差一刻，他们都回到了各自的房间，只有艾姆斯还在食品室里。今天下午你离开我们之后，我一直在做一些实验，我发现当门都关着的时候，麦克唐纳在书房里发出的任何声音都无法穿透我的储藏室。

“It is otherwise, however, from the housekeeper's room. It is not so far down the corridor, and from it I could vaguely hear a voice when it was very loudly raised. The sound from a shotgun is to some extent muffled when the discharge is at very close range, as it undoubtedly was in this instance. It would not be very loud, and yet in the silence of the night it should have easily penetrated to Mrs. Allen's room. She is, as she has told us, somewhat deaf; but none the less she mentioned in her evidence that she did hear something like a door slamming half an hour before the alarm was given. Half an hour before the alarm was given would be a quarter to eleven. I have no doubt that what she heard was the report of the gun, and that this was the real instant of the murder.

”“不过，那是从管家的房间里传来的。它就在走廊尽头不远的地方，我隐约听到一个声音，当声音很大的时候。近距离射击时，猎枪发出的声音在一定程度上是低沉的，这一次无疑是这样。声音不会很大，但是在寂静的夜晚，声音很容易就能穿透到艾伦太太的房间。正如她告诉我们的那样，她有点耳聋; 但是她在证词中提到，在闹钟响起前半小时，她确实听到了类似砰的一声关门声。闹钟响起前半小时是十一点差一刻。我毫不怀疑她听到的是枪声，而这才是谋杀发生的真正时刻。

“If this is so, we have now to determine what Barker and Mrs. Douglas, presuming that they are not the actual murderers, could have been doing from quarter to eleven, when the sound of the shot brought them down, until quarter past eleven, when they rang the bell and summoned the servants. What were they doing, and why did they not instantly give the alarm? That is the question which faces us, and when it has been answered we shall surely have gone some way to solve our problem.”

“如果是这样的话，我们现在必须确定巴克和道格拉斯太太，假定他们不是真正的凶手，从一刻到十一点，当枪声把他们击倒时，他们可能在做什么，直到十一点一刻，他们按铃叫来了仆人。他们在做什么，为什么没有立即发出警报？这就是我们面临的问题，当这个问题得到解决时，我们肯定已经找到了解决问题的办法。”

“I am convinced myself,” said I, “that there is an understanding between those two people. She must be a heartless creature to sit laughing at some jest within a few hours of her husband's murder.”

“我自己也相信,”我说，“这两个人之间是有谅解的。她一定是个没心没肺的家伙，在她丈夫被谋杀后的几个小时里，还坐在那里开玩笑。”

“Exactly. She does not shine as a wife even in her own account of what occurred. I am not a whole-souled admirer of womankind, as you are aware, Watson, but my experience of life has taught me that there are few wives, having any regard for their husbands, who would let any man's spoken word stand between them and that husband's dead body. Should I ever marry, Watson, I should hope to inspire my wife with some feeling which would prevent her from being walked off by a housekeeper when my corpse was lying within a few yards of her. It was badly stage-managed; for even the rawest investigators must be struck by the absence of the usual feminine ululation. If there had been nothing else, this incident alone would have suggested a prearranged conspiracy to my mind.”

“没错。即使在她自己的描述中，她也不是一个出色的妻子。正如你所知道的，华生，我并不是一个彻头彻尾的女性崇拜者，但是我的生活经历告诉我，很少有妻子会尊重她们的丈夫，任何男人的话语都会阻碍她们和丈夫的死亡。如果我结婚了，华生，我希望能激励我的妻子，使她不会在我的尸体就躺在离她几码远的地方的时候，被管家从身边走开。这是一场糟糕的舞台表演，因为即使是最原始的调查人员也一定会为缺乏女性通常的欢呼而感到震惊。如果没有别的原因，这件事本身就足以让我想到一个事先安排好的阴谋。”

“You think then, definitely, that Barker and Mrs. Douglas are guilty of the murder?”

“那么你肯定认为巴克和道格拉斯太太是凶手了?”

“There is an appalling directness about your questions, Watson,” said Holmes, shaking his pipe at me. “They come at me like bullets. If you put it that Mrs. Douglas and Barker know the truth about the murder, and are conspiring to conceal it, then I can give you a whole-souled answer. I am sure they do. But your more deadly proposition is not so clear. Let us for a moment consider the difficulties which stand in the way.

“你的问题太直接了，华生,”福尔摩斯一边说，一边对着我摇着烟斗。“他们像子弹一样向我射来。如果你说道格拉斯夫人和巴克尔夫人知道谋杀的真相，并且密谋隐瞒，那么我可以给你一个完整的答案。我相信他们会的。但是你更致命的命题并不那么清楚。让我们考虑一下阻碍我们前进的困难。

“We will suppose that this couple are united by the bonds of a guilty love, and that they have determined to get rid of the man who stands between them. It is a large supposition; for discreet inquiry among servants and others has failed to corroborate it in any way. On the contrary, there is a good deal of evidence that the Douglases were very attached to each other.”

“我们假设这对夫妇是因为罪恶的爱情而结合在一起的，他们决心除掉那个阻碍他们的人。这是一个很大的假设，因为仆人和其他人的审慎询问无法以任何方式证实这一点。相反，有大量证据表明，道格拉斯夫妇彼此非常亲近。”

“That, I am sure, cannot he true.” said I, thinking of the beautiful smiling face in the garden.

“我敢肯定，这不是真的。”我一边说，一边想着花园里那张美丽的笑脸。

“Well at least they gave that impression. However, we will suppose that they are an extraordinarily astute couple, who deceive everyone upon this point, and conspire to murder the husband. He happens to be a man over whose head some danger hangs—”

“至少他们给人这样的印象。然而，我们会假设他们是一对格外精明的夫妇，他们在这一点上欺骗了所有人，并且密谋谋杀丈夫。他碰巧是一个头顶上有危险的人——”

“We have only their word for that.”

“我们只有他们的一面之词。”

Holmes looked thoughtful. “I see, Watson. You are sketching out a theory by which everything they say from the beginning is false. According to your idea, there was never any hidden menace, or secret society, or Valley of Fear, or Boss MacSomebody, or anything else. Well, that is a good sweeping generalization. Let us see what that brings us to. They invent this theory to account for the crime. They then play up to the idea by leaving this bicycle in the park as proof of the existence of some outsider. The stain on the windowsill conveys the same idea. So does the card on the body, which might have been prepared in the house. That all fits into your hypothesis, Watson. But now we come on the nasty, angular, uncompromising bits which won't slip into their places. Why a cut-off shotgun of all weapons—and an American one at that? How could they be so sure that the sound of it would not bring someone on to them? It's a mere chance as it is that Mrs. Allen did not start out to inquire for the slamming door. Why did your guilty couple do all this, Watson?”

福尔摩斯看上去若有所思。“我明白了，华生。你正在草拟一个理论，根据这个理论，他们从一开始所说的一切都是错误的。根据你的想法，从来没有任何隐藏的威胁，或者秘密社团，或者恐惧谷，或者 Boss MacSomebody，或者其他任何东西。嗯，这是一个很好的概括。让我们拭目以待吧。他们发明了这个理论来解释犯罪。然后他们把这辆自行车留在公园里作为外人存在的证据，以此来迎合这个想法。窗台上的污渍传达了同样的意思。尸体上的卡片也是如此，它可能是在房子里准备的。这些都符合你的假设，华生。但是现在我们来到了讨厌的、棱角分明的、不妥协的部分，它们不会溜进它们的位置。为什么所有武器中都有一把截断式散弹枪ーー而且是美国制造的？他们怎么能这么肯定这声音不会引起别人的注意呢？这只是一个偶然的机会，因为艾伦太太并没有出去要求摔门。为什么你那对罪人夫妇要做这一切，华生?”

“I confess that I can't explain it.”

“我承认我无法解释。”

“Then again, if a woman and her lover conspire to murder a husband, are they going to advertise their guilt by ostentatiously removing his wedding ring after his death? Does that strike you as very probable, Watson?”

“话又说回来，如果一个女人和她的情人合谋谋杀一个丈夫，他们会在丈夫死后炫耀地摘下他的结婚戒指，以此来宣扬自己的罪行吗？你觉得这很可能吗，华生?”

“No, it does not.”

“不，不是的。”

“And once again, if the thought of leaving a bicycle concealed outside had occurred to you, would it really have seemed worth doing when the dullest detective would naturally say this is an obvious blind, as the bicycle is the first thing which the fugitive needed in order to make his escape.”

“再说一次，如果你想到要把自行车藏在外面，那么当最迟钝的侦探自然而然地说这是一个明显的盲点，因为自行车是逃犯逃跑所需要的第一件东西时，你觉得这样做真的值得吗?”

“I can conceive of no explanation.”

“我想不出任何解释。”

“And yet there should be no combination of events for which the wit of man cannot conceive an explanation. Simply as a mental exercise, without any assertion that it is true, let me indicate a possible line of thought. It is, I admit, mere imagination; but how often is imagination the mother of truth?

“然而，不应该有人的智慧无法想象的解释的事件的组合。简单地说，作为一种思维练习，没有任何断言它是正确的，让我指出一条可能的思路。我承认，这仅仅是想象，但想象多久才是真理之母呢？

“We will suppose that there was a guilty secret, a really shameful secret in the life of this man Douglas. This leads to his murder by someone who is, we will suppose, an avenger, someone from outside. This avenger, for some reason which I confess I am still at a loss to explain, took the dead man's wedding ring. The vendetta might conceivably date back to the man's first marriage, and the ring be taken for some such reason.

“我们假定这个人的一生中有一个罪恶的秘密，一个真正可耻的秘密。这就导致了他被一个，我们假设，一个复仇者，一个来自外面的人谋杀。这个复仇者，由于某种原因，我承认我仍然无法解释，拿走了死者的结婚戒指。可以想象，这种仇恨可以追溯到男人的第一次婚姻，而戒指就是因为这样的原因被拿走的。

“Before this avenger got away, Barker and the wife had reached the room. The assassin convinced them that any attempt to arrest him would lead to the publication of some hideous scandal. They were converted to this idea, and preferred to let him go. For this purpose they probably lowered the bridge, which can be done quite noiselessly, and then raised it again. He made his escape, and for some reason thought that he could do so more safely on foot than on the bicycle. He therefore left his machine where it would not be discovered until he had got safely away. So far we are within the bounds of possibility, are we not?”

“在这个复仇者离开之前，巴克和他的妻子已经来到了房间。暗杀者使他们相信，任何逮捕他的企图都会导致丑闻的发表。他们改变了主意，宁愿让他走。为了这个目的，他们可能先把桥降低，然后再把它升起来，这样就不会发出声音了。他逃走了，出于某种原因，他认为步行比骑自行车更安全。因此，他把他的机器留在那里，直到他安全离开才会被发现。到目前为止，我们是在可能的范围内，不是吗?”

“Well, it is possible, no doubt,” said I, with some reserve.

“嗯，这是可能的，毫无疑问,”我有些保留地说。

“We have to remember, Watson, that whatever occurred is certainly something very extraordinary. Well, now, to continue our supposititious case, the couple—not necessarily a guilty couple—realize after the murderer is gone that they have placed themselves in a position in which it may be difficult for them to prove that they did not themselves either do the deed or connive at it. They rapidly and rather clumsily met the situation. The mark was put by Barker's bloodstained slipper upon the window-sill to suggest how the fugitive got away. They obviously were the two who must have heard the sound of the gun; so they gave the alarm exactly as they would have done, but a good half hour after the event.”

“我们必须记住，华生，无论发生了什么，肯定都是非同寻常的事情。好吧，现在，继续我们虚构的情况，这对夫妇---- 不一定是有罪的夫妇---- 意识到在杀人犯离开后，他们把自己置于一种可能很难证明他们自己既没有做过这件事，也没有纵容这件事的境地。他们迅速而相当笨拙地应付了这种情况。巴克的血迹斑斑的拖鞋放在窗台上，暗示着逃犯是如何逃走的。他们显然是听到枪声的那两个人，所以他们按照他们应该做的那样发出了警报，不过是在事件发生后的半小时内。”

“And how do you propose to prove all this?”

“你打算如何证明这一切呢?”

“Well, if there were an outsider, he may be traced and taken. That would be the most effective of all proofs. But if not—well, the resources of science are far from being exhausted. I think that an evening alone in that study would help me much.”

”“好吧，如果有外人的话，他可能会被追踪和带走。这将是所有证据中最有效的。但是如果不是这样的话，科学资源还远远没有枯竭。我认为一个晚上独自呆在书房里会对我很有帮助。”

“An evening alone!”

“一个人的夜晚!”

“I propose to go up there presently. I have arranged it with the estimable Ames, who is by no means whole-hearted about Barker. I shall sit in that room and see if its atmosphere brings me inspiration. I'm a believer in the genius loci. You smile, Friend Watson. Well, we shall see. By the way, you have that big umbrella of yours, have you not?”

“我打算现在就上去。我已经和可敬的艾姆斯安排好了，他对巴克一点也不热心。我将坐在那个房间里，看看它的气氛是否能给我带来灵感。我是这个地方的天才信徒。你笑了，朋友，华生。我们走着瞧吧。顺便说一句，你有那把大伞，是不是?”

“It is here.”

“就在这里。”

“Well, I'll borrow that if I may.”

“好吧，如果可以的话，我想借用一下。”

“Certainly—but what a wretched weapon! If there is danger—”

“当然可以——但是多么可恶的武器啊! 如果有危险的话——”

“Nothing serious, my dear Watson, or I should certainly ask for your assistance. But I'll take the umbrella. At present I am only awaiting the return of our colleagues from Tunbridge Wells, where they are at present engaged in trying for a likely owner to the bicycle.”

“没什么大不了的，我亲爱的华生，不然我当然要请你帮忙了。但是我要带伞。目前，我只是在等待来自 Tunbridge Wells 的同事们回来，他们目前正在努力为这辆自行车找一个可能的主人。”

It was nightfall before Inspector MacDonald and White Mason came back from their expedition, and they arrived exultant, reporting a great advance in our investigation.

夜幕降临，麦克唐纳探长和怀特 · 梅森探险队回来了，他们欣喜若狂地到达，报告说我们的调查取得了巨大的进展。

“Man, I'll admeet that I had my doubts if there was ever an outsider,” said MacDonald, “but that's all past now. We've had the bicycle identified, and we have a description of our man; so that's a long step on our journey.”

麦克唐纳说: “伙计，我承认我曾经怀疑过是否有外人存在，但是现在一切都过去了。我们已经确认了那辆自行车的身份，并且描述了我们要找的人，所以这是我们旅程中的一大步。”

“It sounds to me like the beginning of the end,” said Holmes. “I'm sure I congratulate you both with all my heart.”

“在我看来，这就像是结束的开始,”福尔摩斯说。“我一定衷心祝贺你们两位。”

“Well, I started from the fact that Mr. Douglas had seemed disturbed since the day before, when he had been at Tunbridge Wells. It was at Tunbridge Wells then that he had become conscious of some danger. It was clear, therefore, that if a man had come over with a bicycle it was from Tunbridge Wells that he might be expected to have come. We took the bicycle over with us and showed it at the hotels. It was identified at once by the manager of the Eagle Commercial as belonging to a man named Hargrave, who had taken a room there two days before. This bicycle and a small valise were his whole belongings. He had registered his name as coming from London, but had given no address. The valise was London made, and the contents were British; but the man himself was undoubtedly an American.”

“嗯，我是从道格拉斯先生自从前一天到 Tunbridge Wells 以来似乎一直心神不宁这一事实开始的。就在那时，他在 Tunbridge Wells 意识到了一些危险。因此，很明显，如果一个人带着一辆自行车过来，他可能是从 Tunbridge Wells 来的。我们把自行车随身带着，在旅馆里展示。老鹰商业公司的经理立即确认这是一个叫哈格雷夫的人的东西，他两天前在那里住过一个房间。这辆自行车和一只小旅行箱是他的全部财产。他登记了自己的姓名，说是从伦敦来的，但是没有给出地址。旅行箱是伦敦制造的，里面装的是英国货，但那个人本人无疑是个美国人。”

“Well, well,” said Holmes gleefully, “you have indeed done some solid work while I have been sitting spinning theories with my friend! It's a lesson in being practical, Mr. Mac.”

“好吧，好吧,”福尔摩斯兴高采烈地说，“你确实做了一些实实在在的工作，而我却在和我的朋友闲聊着理论！这是一堂实际的课，麦克先生。”

“Ay, it's just that, Mr. Holmes,” said the inspector with satisfaction.

“唉，就是这样，福尔摩斯先生,”侦察员满意地说。

“But this may all fit in with your theories,” I remarked.

“但这些可能都符合你的理论,”我说。

“That may or may not be. But let us hear the end, Mr. Mac. Was there nothing to identify this man?”

“那可能是，也可能不是。让我们听听结尾吧，麦克先生。难道没有任何东西可以确认这个人的身份吗?”

“So little that it was evident that he had carefully guarded himself against identification. There were no papers or letters, and no marking upon the clothes. A cycle map of the county lay on his bedroom table. He had left the hotel after breakfast yesterday morning on his bicycle, and no more was heard of him until our inquiries.”

”“这么少，很明显，他小心翼翼地保护自己不被认出来。没有文件或信件，衣服上也没有标记。他卧室的桌子上放着一张全县的自行车地图。昨天早上吃过早饭，他骑着自行车离开了旅馆，在我们询问之前，再也没有他的消息。”

“That's what puzzles me, Mr. Holmes,” said White Mason. “If the fellow did not want the hue and cry raised over him, one would imagine that he would have returned and remained at the hotel as an inoffensive tourist. As it is, he must know that he will be reported to the police by the hotel manager and that his disappearance will be connected with the murder.”

“这就是让我困惑的地方，福尔摩斯先生,”怀特 · 梅森说。“如果那家伙不想让人们向他大喊大叫的话，人们会以为他会回来，作为一个无害的游客留在旅馆里。事实上，他必须知道，酒店经理将向警方报案，他的失踪将与谋杀案有关。”

“So one would imagine. Still, he has been justified of his wisdom up to date, at any rate, since he has not been taken. But his description—what of that?”

“所以我们可以想象。尽管如此，至少到目前为止，他的智慧还是被证明是正确的，因为他还没有被带走。但他的描述——那又如何呢?”

MacDonald referred to his notebook. “Here we have it so far as they could give it. They don't seem to have taken any very particular stock of him; but still the porter, the clerk, and the chambermaid are all agreed that this about covers the points. He was a man about five foot nine in height, fifty or so years of age, his hair slightly grizzled, a grayish moustache, a curved nose, and a face which all of them described as fierce and forbidding.”

麦克唐纳提到了他的笔记本。“他们能给我们的只有这些。他们似乎对他没有什么特别的看法，但是看门人、服务员和女服务员都同意这样就可以了。他身高约五英尺九英寸，大约五十岁左右，头发有点灰白，留着浅灰色的小胡子，弯弯的鼻子，所有人都形容他的面孔凶狠而严峻。”

“Well, bar the expression, that might almost be a description of Douglas himself,” said Holmes. “He is just over fifty, with grizzled hair and moustache, and about the same height. Did you get anything else?”

“好吧，除了这个表达，这几乎可以说是对道格拉斯本人的描述,”福尔摩斯说。“他刚过五十岁，头发和胡子灰白，身高差不多。你还有什么收获吗?”

“He was dressed in a heavy gray suit with a reefer jacket, and he wore a short yellow overcoat and a soft cap.”

他穿着一身沉重的灰色西装和一件冷藏夹克，外面穿着一件黄色的短大衣，戴着一顶软帽子

“What about the shotgun?”

“猎枪呢?”

“It is less than two feet long. It could very well have fitted into his valise. He could have carried it inside his overcoat without difficulty.”

“它不到两英尺长。他的手提箱里完全可以装得下。他可以毫不费力地把它放在大衣里。”

“And how do you consider that all this bears upon the general case?”

“你认为这一切与一般情况有什么关系?”

“Well, Mr. Holmes,” said MacDonald, “when we have got our man—and you may be sure that I had his description on the wires within five minutes of hearing it—we shall be better able to judge. But, even as it stands, we have surely gone a long way. We know that an American calling himself Hargrave came to Tunbridge Wells two days ago with bicycle and valise. In the latter was a sawed-off shotgun; so he came with the deliberate purpose of crime. Yesterday morning he set off for this place on his bicycle, with his gun concealed in his overcoat. No one saw him arrive, so far as we can learn; but he need not pass through the village to reach the park gates, and there are many cyclists upon the road. Presumably he at once concealed his cycle among the laurels where it was found, and possibly lurked there himself, with his eye on the house, waiting for Mr. Douglas to come out. The shotgun is a strange weapon to use inside a house; but he had intended to use it outside, and there it has very obvious advantages, as it would be impossible to miss with it, and the sound of shots is so common in an English sporting neighbourhood that no particular notice would be taken.”

“嗯，福尔摩斯先生,”麦克唐纳说，“当我们找到那个人时——你可以肯定，我在听到他的描述后五分钟内就在电报上看到了——我们就能更好地判断了。但是，就目前的情况来看，我们肯定已经走了很长的路。我们知道，两天前，一个自称哈格里夫的美国人带着自行车和行李箱来到坦布里奇韦尔斯。后者是一个削短型猎枪，所以他故意带着犯罪的目的而来。昨天上午，他骑着自行车，把枪藏在大衣里，向这个地方出发了。据我们所知，没有人看见他到达，但是他不需要穿过村庄到达公园的大门，路上有很多骑自行车的人。据推测，他立刻把自行车藏在发现它的那些桂冠中间，很可能就潜伏在那里，眼睛盯着房子，等着道格拉斯先生出来。在房子里使用猎枪是一种奇怪的武器，但他本来是打算在外面使用的，在那里它有非常明显的优势，因为它不可能被漏掉，而且枪声在英国的运动场附近是如此常见，以至于没有特别的警告。”

“That is all very clear,” said Holmes.

“这一切都很清楚,”福尔摩斯说。

“Well, Mr. Douglas did not appear. What was he to do next? He left his bicycle and approached the house in the twilight. He found the bridge down and no one about. He took his chance, intending, no doubt, to make some excuse if he met anyone. He met no one. He slipped into the first room that he saw, and concealed himself behind the curtain. Thence he could see the drawbridge go up, and he knew that his only escape was through the moat. He waited until quarter-past eleven, when Mr. Douglas upon his usual nightly round came into the room. He shot him and escaped, as arranged. He was aware that the bicycle would be described by the hotel people and be a clue against him; so he left it there and made his way by some other means to London or to some safe hiding place which he had already arranged. How is that, Mr. Holmes?”

”“嗯，道格拉斯先生没有出现。他接下来要做什么？他放下自行车，在暮色中向房子走去。他发现桥已倒下，四周无人。他抓住机会，无疑是想在遇到什么人的时候找个借口。他没有遇见任何人。他溜进他看见的第一个房间，躲在帘子后面。从那里他可以看到吊桥升起来了，他知道他唯一的出路就是穿过护城河。他一直等到十一点一刻，这时道格拉斯先生照例在夜间巡视，走进了房间。他开枪打死了他，然后按计划逃跑了。他知道旅馆里的人会把这辆自行车描述成对他不利的线索; 所以他把自行车留在那里，用其他方法去了伦敦或他已经安排好的某个安全的藏身之处。怎么样，福尔摩斯先生?”

“Well, Mr. Mac, it is very good and very clear so far as it goes. That is your end of the story. My end is that the crime was committed half an hour earlier than reported; that Mrs. Douglas and Barker are both in a conspiracy to conceal something; that they aided the murderer's escape—or at least that they reached the room before he escaped—and that they fabricated evidence of his escape through the window, whereas in all probability they had themselves let him go by lowering the bridge. That's my reading of the first half.”

“嗯，麦克先生，到目前为止，情况非常好，也非常清楚。这就是你的故事结局。我的结论是，罪行发生的时间比报道的早半个小时; 道格拉斯夫人和巴克尔都参与了隐瞒某些事情的阴谋; 他们帮助了凶手逃跑ーー或者至少在他逃跑之前他们到达了那个房间ーー他们伪造了他从窗户逃跑的证据，而且很可能是他们自己把桥放下让他逃走的。这就是我对上半场的解读。”

The two detectives shook their heads.

两个侦探摇了摇头。

“Well, Mr. Holmes, if this is true, we only tumble out of one mystery into another,” said the London inspector.

“好吧，福尔摩斯先生，如果这是真的，我们只会从一个谜团进入另一个谜团,”伦敦巡查员说。

“And in some ways a worse one,” added White Mason. “The lady has never been in America in all her life. What possible connection could she have with an American assassin which would cause her to shelter him?”

“从某些方面来说，情况更糟糕,”怀特 · 梅森补充说。“这位女士一辈子都没有去过美国。她和一个美国杀手有什么关系，能让她庇护他呢?”

“I freely admit the difficulties,” said Holmes. “I propose to make a little investigation of my own to-night, and it is just possible that it may contribute something to the common cause.”

“我坦率地承认这些困难,”福尔摩斯说。“我打算今晚自己做一个小小的调查，这可能对我们的共同事业有所贡献。”

“Can we help you, Mr. Holmes?”

“我们能为您效劳吗，福尔摩斯先生?”

“No, no! Darkness and Dr. Watson's umbrella—my wants are simple. And Ames, the faithful Ames, no doubt he will stretch a point for me. All my lines of thought lead me back invariably to the one basic question—why should an athletic man develop his frame upon so unnatural an instrument as a single dumb-bell?”

“不，不！黑暗和华生医生的伞ーー我的需要很简单。还有埃姆斯，忠实的埃姆斯，毫无疑问，他会为我伸出一个点。我所有的思路都不约而同地把我带回到一个基本的问题上——为什么一个运动员要用一个非自然的工具来发展自己的身体，就像一个哑铃?”

It was late that night when Holmes returned from his solitary excursion. We slept in a double-bedded room, which was the best that the little country inn could do for us. I was already asleep when I was partly awakened by his entrance.

那天深夜，福尔摩斯结束了单独的远足回来。我们睡在一个双人房间里，这是乡村小旅馆能为我们做的最好的事情了。我已经睡着了，这时我被他的进来弄醒了一部分。

“Well, Holmes,” I murmured, “have you found anything out?”

“好吧，福尔摩斯,”我喃喃地说，“你有什么发现吗?”

He stood beside me in silence, his candle in his hand. Then the tall, lean figure inclined towards me. “I say, Watson,” he whispered, “would you be afraid to sleep in the same room with a lunatic, a man with softening of the brain, an idiot whose mind has lost its grip?”

他静静地站在我旁边，手里拿着蜡烛。然后那个高高瘦瘦的身影向我倾斜。“我说，华生,”他低声说，“你会害怕和一个疯子，一个脑子软化的人，一个脑子失控的白痴睡在同一个房间吗?”

“Not in the least,” I answered in astonishment.

“一点也不,”我惊讶地回答。

“Ah, that's lucky,” he said, and not another word would he utter that night.

“啊，真幸运,”他说，那天晚上他再也不说话了
