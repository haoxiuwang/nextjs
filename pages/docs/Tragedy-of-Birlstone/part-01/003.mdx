  book: "The Tragedy of Birlstone"
}

Now for a moment I will ask leave to remove my own insignificant personality and to describe events which occurred before we arrived upon the scene by the light of knowledge which came to us afterwards. Only in this way can I make the reader appreciate the people concerned and the strange setting in which their fate was cast.

现在，我请求允许我去掉我自己微不足道的个性，描述一下在我们到达现场之前发生的事情，这些事情是我们后来才了解到的。只有这样，我才能使读者欣赏有关的人和奇怪的背景，他们的命运被投在。

The village of Birlstone is a small and very ancient cluster of half-timbered cottages on the northern border of the county of Sussex. For centuries it had remained unchanged; but within the last few years its picturesque appearance and situation have attracted a number of well-to-do residents, whose villas peep out from the woods around. These woods are locally supposed to be the extreme fringe of the great Weald forest, which thins away until it reaches the northern chalk downs. A number of small shops have come into being to meet the wants of the increased population; so there seems some prospect that Birlstone may soon grow from an ancient village into a modern town. It is the centre for a considerable area of country, since Tunbridge Wells, the nearest place of importance, is ten or twelve miles to the eastward, over the borders of Kent.

Birlstone 是苏塞克斯郡北部边界上一个古老的半木结构的小村庄。几个世纪以来，它一直没有改变，但是在最近几年里，它如画的外表和风景吸引了一些富裕的居民，他们的别墅从附近的树林里向外窥视。这些树林在当地被认为是伟大的 Weald 森林的极端边缘，它逐渐变薄，直到到达北部的白垩丘陵。为了满足日益增长的人口的需要，许多小商店已经出现，因此，Birlstone 似乎有可能很快从一个古老的村庄发展成为一个现代化的城镇。它是一个相当大的国土面积的中心，因为通布里奇韦尔斯，最重要的地方，是向东十到十二英里，越过肯特边界。

About half a mile from the town, standing in an old park famous for its huge beech trees, is the ancient Manor House of Birlstone. Part of this venerable building dates back to the time of the first crusade, when Hugo de Capus built a fortalice in the centre of the estate, which had been granted to him by the Red King. This was destroyed by fire in 1543, and some of its smoke-blackened corner stones were used when, in Jacobean times, a brick country house rose upon the ruins of the feudal castle.

离小镇大约半英里的地方是 Birlstone 的古老庄园，它位于一个以高大的山毛榉树闻名的古老公园里。这座古老建筑的一部分可以追溯到第一次十字军东征时期，当时雨果 · 德 · 卡普斯在庄园中心建造了一座堡垒，这是红色国王授予他的。在英国詹姆士一世时代，一座砖砌的乡间别墅矗立在封建城堡的废墟之上。

The Manor House, with its many gables and its small diamond-paned windows, was still much as the builder had left it in the early seventeenth century. Of the double moats which had guarded its more warlike predecessor, the outer had been allowed to dry up, and served the humble function of a kitchen garden. The inner one was still there, and lay forty feet in breadth, though now only a few feet in depth, round the whole house. A small stream fed it and continued beyond it, so that the sheet of water, though turbid, was never ditch-like or unhealthy. The ground floor windows were within a foot of the surface of the water.

庄园住宅，有着许多山墙和菱形小窗户，仍然和十七世纪早期建造者离开时的样子很像。双护城河保护着它更好战的前身，外面的护城河已经干涸了，起到了厨房花园的卑微作用。里面的房子还在那里，四十英尺宽，虽然现在只有几英尺深，但是围绕着整个房子。一条小溪注入河水，并继续流过河水，这样，这片水虽然浑浊，但决不会像沟渠一样，不会有害健康。一楼的窗户离水面不到一英尺。

The only approach to the house was over a drawbridge, the chains and windlass of which had long been rusted and broken. The latest tenants of the Manor House had, however, with characteristic energy, set this right, and the drawbridge was not only capable of being raised, but actually was raised every evening and lowered every morning. By thus renewing the custom of the old feudal days the Manor House was converted into an island during the night—a fact which had a very direct bearing upon the mystery which was soon to engage the attention of all England.

通往这座房子的唯一通道是一座吊桥，吊索和绞盘早已生锈和损坏。然而，这座庄园的最新住户们已经用他们特有的精力把这个问题解决了，吊桥不仅可以升起，而且每天晚上都可以升起，每天早上也可以降下。这样一来，旧封建时代的风俗又复活了，庄园在夜间变成了一个孤岛，这一事实与很快引起全英格兰注意的神秘事件有着非常直接的关系。

The house had been untenanted for some years and was threatening to moulder into a picturesque decay when the Douglases took possession of it. This family consisted of only two individuals—John Douglas and his wife. Douglas was a remarkable man, both in character and in person. In age he may have been about fifty, with a strong-jawed, rugged face, a grizzling moustache, peculiarly keen gray eyes, and a wiry, vigorous figure which had lost nothing of the strength and activity of youth. He was cheery and genial to all, but somewhat offhand in his manners, giving the impression that he had seen life in social strata on some far lower horizon than the county society of Sussex.

这所房子已经有几年没有出租了，当道格拉斯一家占有它的时候，它已经快要变成一座风景如画的破房子了。这个家庭只有两个人——约翰 · 道格拉斯和他的妻子。道格拉斯是一个了不起的人，无论是在性格上还是在外表上。他大概有五十岁左右，有一张强壮的下巴，粗糙的脸，油腻的胡子，特别敏锐的灰色眼睛，瘦长而精力充沛的身材，丝毫没有失去年轻人的活力和活力。他对所有人都很和蔼可亲，但举止有些随便，给人的印象是他在远远低于苏塞克斯郡社会的地平线上看到了社会阶层的生活。

Yet, though looked at with some curiosity and reserve by his more cultivated neighbours, he soon acquired a great popularity among the villagers, subscribing handsomely to all local objects, and attending their smoking concerts and other functions, where, having a remarkably rich tenor voice, he was always ready to oblige with an excellent song. He appeared to have plenty of money, which was said to have been gained in the California gold fields, and it was clear from his own talk and that of his wife that he had spent a part of his life in America.

然而，尽管他的邻居们对他有些好奇和拘谨，但他很快就在村民中间受到了很大的欢迎，慷慨地订购当地的物品，参加他们的吸烟音乐会和其他活动，在那里，他有着非常丰富的男高音嗓音，随时准备献上一首好歌。他似乎很有钱，据说是在加利福尼亚的金矿里赚来的，从他自己和他妻子的谈话中可以清楚地看出，他在美国生活了一段时间。

The good impression which had been produced by his generosity and by his democratic manners was increased by a reputation gained for utter indifference to danger. Though a wretched rider, he turned out at every meet, and took the most amazing falls in his determination to hold his own with the best. When the vicarage caught fire he distinguished himself also by the fearlessness with which he reentered the building to save property, after the local fire brigade had given it up as impossible. Thus it came about that John Douglas of the Manor House had within five years won himself quite a reputation in Birlstone.

他的慷慨和他的民主风度给人留下了良好的印象，而他对危险完全漠不关心的名声又增加了这种印象。虽然他是一个不幸的骑手，但是每次比赛他都会出现，并且在他决心用最好的方式保持自己的时候经历了最惊人的失败。当牧师住宅着火时，他也表现出了无畏的精神，在当地消防队认为不可能之后，他再次进入大楼抢救财产。因此，五年之内，庄园主约翰 · 道格拉斯在 Birlstone 赢得了相当高的声誉。

His wife, too, was popular with those who had made her acquaintance; though, after the English fashion, the callers upon a stranger who settled in the county without introductions were few and far between. This mattered the less to her, as she was retiring by disposition, and very much absorbed, to all appearance, in her husband and her domestic duties. It was known that she was an English lady who had met Mr. Douglas in London, he being at that time a widower. She was a beautiful woman, tall, dark, and slender, some twenty years younger than her husband, a disparity which seemed in no wise to mar the contentment of their family life.

他的妻子也很受那些认识她的人的欢迎; 不过，按照英国的风俗，来访者很少见到一个陌生人，这个陌生人没有经过介绍就定居在这个郡里。这对她来说就不那么重要了，因为她生性退隐，对她的丈夫和她的家务事全神贯注。大家都知道她是一位英国女士，在伦敦认识了道格拉斯先生，当时他是一位鳏夫。她是个美丽的女人，身材高挑，皮肤黝黑，身材苗条，比她丈夫年轻大约二十岁，这种差距似乎并不影响他们对家庭生活的满意。

It was remarked sometimes, however, by those who knew them best, that the confidence between the two did not appear to be complete, since the wife was either very reticent about her husband's past life, or else, as seemed more likely, was imperfectly informed about it. It had also been noted and commented upon by a few observant people that there were signs sometimes of some nerve-strain upon the part of Mrs. Douglas, and that she would display acute uneasiness if her absent husband should ever be particularly late in his return. On a quiet countryside, where all gossip is welcome, this weakness of the lady of the Manor House did not pass without remark, and it bulked larger upon people's memory when the events arose which gave it a very special significance.

然而，那些最了解他们的人有时会说，两人之间的信任似乎并不完全，因为妻子要么对丈夫过去的生活非常沉默寡言，要么——似乎更有可能——对这件事知之甚少。一些细心的人也注意到并评论道，道格拉斯太太有时会有一些神经紧张的迹象，如果她不在身边的丈夫回来得特别晚，她会表现出极大的不安。在一个宁静的乡村，所有的流言蜚语都是受欢迎的，庄园主人的这种软弱不会不引起注意，当这些事情发生的时候，人们的记忆就会更加深刻，从而赋予它一种特殊的意义。

There was yet another individual whose residence under that roof was, it is true, only an intermittent one, but whose presence at the time of the strange happenings which will now be narrated brought his name prominently before the public. This was Cecil James Barker, of Hales Lodge, Hampstead.

当然，还有一个人，他住在那个屋檐下，只是断断续续的一个人，但是在发生这些奇怪的事情的时候，他的名字就突出地出现在公众面前。这位是塞西尔 · 詹姆斯 · 巴克，来自汉普斯特得的黑尔斯 · 洛奇。

Cecil Barker's tall, loose-jointed figure was a familiar one in the main street of Birlstone village; for he was a frequent and welcome visitor at the Manor House. He was the more noticed as being the only friend of the past unknown life of Mr. Douglas who was ever seen in his new English surroundings. Barker was himself an undoubted Englishman; but by his remarks it was clear that he had first known Douglas in America and had there lived on intimate terms with him. He appeared to be a man of considerable wealth, and was reputed to be a bachelor.

塞西尔 · 巴克尔松散的身材在 Birlstone 的主要街道上很常见，因为他是庄园主宅邸的常客和受欢迎的访客。他是道格拉斯先生过去不为人知的生活中唯一的朋友，在他新的英语环境中被人看见，因此更引人注目。巴克本人就是一个毫无疑问的英国人; 但是从他的评论中可以清楚地看出，他第一次认识道格拉斯是在美国，并且在那里和他生活得很亲密。他看上去是个相当富有的人，而且据说是个单身汉。

In age he was rather younger than Douglas—forty-five at the most—a tall, straight, broad-chested fellow with a clean-shaved, prize-fighter face, thick, strong, black eyebrows, and a pair of masterful black eyes which might, even without the aid of his very capable hands, clear a way for him through a hostile crowd. He neither rode nor shot, but spent his days in wandering round the old village with his pipe in his mouth, or in driving with his host, or in his absence with his hostess, over the beautiful countryside. “An easy-going, free-handed gentleman,” said Ames, the butler. “But, my word! I had rather not be the man that crossed him!” He was cordial and intimate with Douglas, and he was no less friendly with his wife—a friendship which more than once seemed to cause some irritation to the husband, so that even the servants were able to perceive his annoyance. Such was the third person who was one of the family when the catastrophe occurred.

他比道格拉斯年轻得多——最多45岁——高大、挺拔、胸膛宽阔，刮着胡子，一张职业拳击手的脸，浓密、强壮、黑色的眉毛，一双熟练的黑眼睛，即使没有他那双非常能干的手的帮助，也可以为他在敌对的人群中开辟一条道路。他既不骑马也不开枪，而是整天叼着烟斗在这个古老的村庄里游荡，或者和他的主人一起开车，或者不在家和他的女主人一起开车，穿过美丽的乡村。“一个随和的、不拘小节的绅士,”管家艾姆斯说。”“可是，我的天哪！我宁愿不是那个惹恼他的人!”他和道格拉斯关系亲密，热情，对妻子也很友好ーー这种友谊似乎不止一次地激怒了丈夫，甚至连仆人都能感受到他的烦恼。这就是灾难发生时家里的第三个人。

As to the other denizens of the old building, it will suffice out of a large household to mention the prim, respectable, and capable Ames, and Mrs. Allen, a buxom and cheerful person, who relieved the lady of some of her household cares. The other six servants in the house bear no relation to the events of the night of January 6th.

至于老房子里的其他居民，在一个大家庭里，只要提到一本正经、体面、能干的艾姆斯和艾伦太太就足够了，艾伦太太是一个丰满、快乐的人，她帮这位太太解决了一些家务事。房子里的其他六个仆人和1月6日晚上发生的事情没有任何关系。

It was at eleven forty-five that the first alarm reached the small local police station, in charge of Sergeant Wilson of the Sussex Constabulary. Cecil Barker, much excited, had rushed up to the door and pealed furiously upon the bell. A terrible tragedy had occurred at the Manor House, and John Douglas had been murdered. That was the breathless burden of his message. He had hurried back to the house, followed within a few minutes by the police sergeant, who arrived at the scene of the crime a little after twelve o'clock, after taking prompt steps to warn the county authorities that something serious was afoot.

十一点四十五分，第一声警报响到了当地的一个小警察局，负责苏塞克斯警察局的威尔逊警官。塞西尔 · 巴克十分激动，冲到门口，用力按着门铃。庄园发生了可怕的悲剧，约翰 · 道格拉斯被谋杀了。这就是他信息中令人窒息的负担。他匆匆赶回了家，几分钟后，警官跟在他后面，十二点刚过，他立即采取措施，警告县当局有严重的事情正在发生，然后到达了犯罪现场。

On reaching the Manor House, the sergeant had found the drawbridge down, the windows lighted up, and the whole household in a state of wild confusion and alarm. The white-faced servants were huddling together in the hall, with the frightened butler wringing his hands in the doorway. Only Cecil Barker seemed to be master of himself and his emotions; he had opened the door which was nearest to the entrance and he had beckoned to the sergeant to follow him. At that moment there arrived Dr. Wood, a brisk and capable general practitioner from the village. The three men entered the fatal room together, while the horror-stricken butler followed at their heels, closing the door behind him to shut out the terrible scene from the maid servants.

到了庄园宅邸，警官发现吊桥放下了，窗户亮了起来，整个家庭陷入了极度的混乱和恐慌之中。白脸的仆人们挤在大厅里，吓坏了的管家在门口绞着手。只有塞西尔 · 巴克尔似乎能够控制自己的情绪，他打开了离入口最近的那扇门，示意警官跟着他。这时，伍德博士来了，他是村里来的一位普通科医生，精力充沛，生气勃勃。这三个人一起走进了那个要命的房间，惊恐万状的管家跟在他们后面，关上身后的门，不让女仆看到那可怕的场面。

The dead man lay on his back, sprawling with outstretched limbs in the centre of the room. He was clad only in a pink dressing gown, which covered his night clothes. There were carpet slippers on his bare feet. The doctor knelt beside him and held down the hand lamp which had stood on the table. One glance at the victim was enough to show the healer that his presence could be dispensed with. The man had been horribly injured. Lying across his chest was a curious weapon, a shotgun with the barrel sawed off a foot in front of the triggers. It was clear that this had been fired at close range and that he had received the whole charge in the face, blowing his head almost to pieces. The triggers had been wired together, so as to make the simultaneous discharge more destructive.

死者仰面躺着，四肢伸展着，躺在房间的中央。他只穿了一件粉红色的睡衣，这件睡衣盖住了他的睡衣。他光着脚，脚上穿着地毯拖鞋。医生跪在他身边，放下了放在桌子上的手灯。只要看一眼受害者，就足以让治疗师知道，他的存在是可以避免的。这个人受了重伤。他胸前横放着一件奇怪的武器，枪管在扳机前被锯掉了一英尺。很明显，这是近距离射击的，他的脸上挨了一枪，头几乎被炸成了碎片。触发器被连接在一起，使同时放电更具破坏性。

The country policeman was unnerved and troubled by the tremendous responsibility which had come so suddenly upon him. “We will touch nothing until my superiors arrive,” he said in a hushed voice, staring in horror at the dreadful head.

这位乡村警察对突然降临在他身上的巨大责任感到不安和不安。“在我的上司到来之前，我们什么也不会碰,”他压低声音说，惊恐地盯着这个可怕的头颅。

“Nothing has been touched up to now,” said Cecil Barker. “I'll answer for that. You see it all exactly as I found it.”

塞西尔 · 巴克说: “到目前为止还没有任何改进。”。“我会为此负责的。你看到的和我发现的一模一样。”

“When was that?” The sergeant had drawn out his notebook.

“什么时候的事?”中士抽出他的笔记本。

“It was just half-past eleven. I had not begun to undress, and I was sitting by the fire in my bedroom when I heard the report. It was not very loud—it seemed to be muffled. I rushed down—I don't suppose it was thirty seconds before I was in the room.”

“现在才十一点半。我还没有开始脱衣服，当我听到这个报告的时候，我正坐在卧室的火炉旁。声音不是很大，好像有点闷。我冲了下去，我想还不到三十秒我就进了房间.”

“Was the door open?”

“门开着吗?”

“Yes, it was open. Poor Douglas was lying as you see him. His bedroom candle was burning on the table. It was I who lit the lamp some minutes afterward.”

“是的，门是开着的。可怜的道格拉斯在撒谎。他卧室的蜡烛在桌子上燃烧。几分钟后，是我点燃了灯。”

“Did you see no one?”

“你没看见任何人吗?”

“No. I heard Mrs. Douglas coming down the stair behind me, and I rushed out to prevent her from seeing this dreadful sight. Mrs. Allen, the housekeeper, came and took her away. Ames had arrived, and we ran back into the room once more.”

“没有。我听到道格拉斯太太从我身后的楼梯上走下来，于是我冲了出去，不让她看到这可怕的景象。管家艾伦太太过来把她带走了。艾姆斯到了，我们又跑回房间。”

“But surely I have heard that the drawbridge is kept up all night.”

“不过，我肯定听说吊桥整夜不开。”

“Yes, it was up until I lowered it.”

“是的，它一直在上面，直到我把它放下来。”

“Then how could any murderer have got away? It is out of the question! Mr. Douglas must have shot himself.”

“那么怎么会有杀人犯逃跑了呢? 这是不可能的! 道格拉斯先生一定是开枪自杀的。”

“That was our first idea. But see!” Barker drew aside the curtain, and showed that the long, diamond-paned window was open to its full extent. “And look at this!” He held the lamp down and illuminated a smudge of blood like the mark of a boot-sole upon the wooden sill. “Someone has stood there in getting out.”

“那是我们的第一个想法。但是你看!”巴克拉开窗帘，向大家展示那扇长长的菱形玻璃窗已经全开了。“看看这个!”他把灯放下来，照亮了一块血迹，就像木窗台上靴底的印记。“有人站在那里想出去。”

“You mean that someone waded across the moat?”

“你是说有人涉水穿过护城河?”

“Exactly!”

“没错!”

“Then if you were in the room within half a minute of the crime, he must have been in the water at that very moment.”

“那么，如果你在案发半分钟内出现在那个房间里，那么他一定就是在那个时刻下水的。”

“I have not a doubt of it. I wish to heaven that I had rushed to the window! But the curtain screened it, as you can see, and so it never occurred to me. Then I heard the step of Mrs. Douglas, and I could not let her enter the room. It would have been too horrible.”

“我对此毫不怀疑。我真希望我是冲到窗前去的！但是正如你所看到的，窗帘把它遮住了，所以我从来没有想到过。然后我听到了道格拉斯太太的脚步声，我不能让她进入房间。那样太可怕了。”

“Horrible enough!” said the doctor, looking at the shattered head and the terrible marks which surrounded it. “I've never seen such injuries since the Birlstone railway smash.”

“够可怕的!”医生说，看着那颗破碎的头颅和它周围可怕的痕迹。“自从 Birlstone 铁路事故以来，我从未见过如此严重的伤害。”

“But, I say,” remarked the police sergeant, whose slow, bucolic common sense was still pondering the open window. “It's all very well your saying that a man escaped by wading this moat, but what I ask you is, how did he ever get into the house at all if the bridge was up?”

“但是，我说,”警官说，他那缓慢而田园风味的常识还在琢磨着打开的窗户。“你说一个人涉水越过这条护城河逃走了，这倒没什么，但我要问你的是，如果桥没有倒塌，他是怎么进来的呢?”

“Ah, that's the question,” said Barker.

“啊，这就是问题所在,”巴克说。

“At what o'clock was it raised?”

“几点钟升起来的?”

“It was nearly six o'clock,” said Ames, the butler.

“快六点了,”管家艾姆斯说。

“I've heard,” said the sergeant, “that it was usually raised at sunset. That would be nearer half-past four than six at this time of year.”

“我听说,”中士说，“它通常是在日落时升起来的。在每年的这个时候，这将接近四点半，而不是六点。”

“Mrs. Douglas had visitors to tea,” said Ames. “I couldn't raise it until they went. Then I wound it up myself.”

“道格拉斯太太有客人来喝茶,”艾姆斯说。“直到他们走了，我才抬起头来。然后我自己上了发条。”

“Then it comes to this,” said the sergeant: “If anyone came from outside—if they did—they must have got in across the bridge before six and been in hiding ever since, until Mr. Douglas came into the room after eleven.”

“那么就是这样了,”中士说，“如果有人从外面来——如果有的话——他们一定是在六点之前过了桥，从那以后就一直躲着，直到十一点之后道格拉斯先生进了房间。”

“That is so! Mr. Douglas went round the house every night the last thing before he turned in to see that the lights were right. That brought him in here. The man was waiting and shot him. Then he got away through the window and left his gun behind him. That's how I read it; for nothing else will fit the facts.”

“就是这样！道格拉斯先生每天晚上睡觉前最后一件事就是巡视一下房子，看看灯光是否正确。把他带到这里来。那个男人在等着，然后开枪打死了他。然后他从窗户逃走，把枪留在身后。我就是这么看的，因为没有别的东西符合事实。”

The sergeant picked up a card which lay beside the dead man on the floor. The initials V. V. and under them the number 341 were rudely scrawled in ink upon it.

中士捡起一张放在地板上死者旁边的卡片。上面用墨水潦草地写下了首字母 v. 和数字341。

“What's this?” he asked, holding it up.

“这是什么?”他举着它问道。

Barker looked at it with curiosity. “I never noticed it before,” he said. “The murderer must have left it behind him.”

巴克好奇地看着它。“我以前从来没有注意到,”他说。“一定是凶手留下的。”

“V. V.—341. I can make no sense of that.”

“ v. v. ー341. 我无法理解。”

The sergeant kept turning it over in his big fingers. “What's V. V.? Somebody's initials, maybe. What have you got there, Dr. Wood?”

中士不停地用他的大手指翻来翻去。“ v v 是什么？也许是某人名字的首字母。你拿的是什么，伍德博士?”

It was a good-sized hammer which had been lying on the rug in front of the fireplace—a substantial, workmanlike hammer. Cecil Barker pointed to a box of brass-headed nails upon the mantelpiece.

那是一把大小合适的锤子，一直放在壁炉前的地毯上，是一把结实的、工作用的锤子。塞西尔 · 巴克指着壁炉架上的一盒黄铜头钉。

“Mr. Douglas was altering the pictures yesterday,” he said. “I saw him myself, standing upon that chair and fixing the big picture above it. That accounts for the hammer.”

“道格拉斯先生昨天修改了照片,”他说。“我亲眼看见他站在那把椅子上，把上面的那幅大画固定好。这就解释了为什么会有锤子。”

“We'd best put it back on the rug where we found it,” said the sergeant, scratching his puzzled head in his perplexity. “It will want the best brains in the force to get to the bottom of this thing. It will be a London job before it is finished.” He raised the hand lamp and walked slowly round the room. “Hullo!” he cried, excitedly, drawing the window curtain to one side. “What o'clock were those curtains drawn?”

“我们最好把它放回找到它的地毯上,”中士说，困惑不解地挠着头。“它希望警方最优秀的人才能查明真相。在完工之前，这将是一项伦敦的工作。”他举起手灯，在房间里慢慢地走着。“你好!”他兴奋地叫了起来，把窗帘拉到一边。“那些窗帘是什么时候拉下来的?”

“When the lamps were lit,” said the butler. “It would be shortly after four.”

“灯点着的时候,”管家说，“大概是四点多一点。”

“Someone had been hiding here, sure enough.” He held down the light, and the marks of muddy boots were very visible in the corner. “I'm bound to say this bears out your theory, Mr. Barker. It looks as if the man got into the house after four when the curtains were drawn and before six when the bridge was raised. He slipped into this room, because it was the first that he saw. There was no other place where he could hide, so he popped in behind this curtain. That all seems clear enough. It is likely that his main idea was to burgle the house; but Mr. Douglas chanced to come upon him, so he murdered him and escaped.”

“肯定有人藏在这里。”他压住灯光，在角落里可以清楚地看到靴子上沾满泥巴的痕迹。“我必须说这证实了你的理论，巴克先生。看起来好像这个人是在四点钟拉上窗帘之后进入房子的，六点钟桥梁升起之前进入的。他溜进这个房间，因为这是他第一次看见。他没有其他地方可以躲藏，所以他钻进了这个帘子后面。这一切看起来都很清楚。他的主要目的很可能是要偷窃这所房子，但是道格拉斯先生碰巧遇到了他，所以他杀了他，然后逃跑了。”

“That's how I read it,” said Barker. “But, I say, aren't we wasting precious time? Couldn't we start out and scour the country before the fellow gets away?”

“我就是这么看的,”巴克说。”“但是，我说，我们不是在浪费宝贵的时间吗？难道我们不能在那家伙逃走之前出发，到全国各地搜寻一下吗?”

The sergeant considered for a moment.

中士考虑了一会儿。

“There are no trains before six in the morning; so he can't get away by rail. If he goes by road with his legs all dripping, it's odds that someone will notice him. Anyhow, I can't leave here myself until I am relieved. But I think none of you should go until we see more clearly how we all stand.”

“早上六点以前没有火车，所以他不能乘火车离开。如果他双腿淋漓地走在路上，很可能会有人注意到他。无论如何，我不能离开这里，直到我得到解脱。但我认为，在我们更清楚地看到我们的立场之前，你们都不应该离开。”

The doctor had taken the lamp and was narrowly scrutinizing the body. “What's this mark?” he asked. “Could this have any connection with the crime?”

医生拿走了灯，仔细地检查着尸体。“这个标记是什么?”他问道。“这和犯罪有关吗?”

The dead man's right arm was thrust out from his dressing gown, and exposed as high as the elbow. About halfway up the forearm was a curious brown design, a triangle inside a circle, standing out in vivid relief upon the lard-coloured skin.

死者的右臂从他的晨衣里伸出来，露出了胳膊肘那么高。在前臂的中部有一个奇怪的棕色图案，一个圆圈里的三角形，在猪油色的皮肤上显得生动鲜明。

“It's not tattooed,” said the doctor, peering through his glasses. “I never saw anything like it. The man has been branded at some time as they brand cattle. What is the meaning of this?”

“没有纹身,”医生透过眼镜看着我说。“我从未见过这样的事情。这个人曾经因为他们给牛打烙印而被烙上烙印。这是什么意思?”

“I don't profess to know the meaning of it,” said Cecil Barker; “but I have seen the mark on Douglas many times this last ten years.”

塞西尔 · 巴克尔说: “我不知道这是什么意思，但在过去的十年里，我已经多次看到道格拉斯身上的烙印了。”

“And so have I,” said the butler. “Many a time when the master has rolled up his sleeves I have noticed that very mark. I've often wondered what it could be.”

“我也是,”管家说。“很多时候，当大师卷起袖子的时候，我注意到了那个非常明显的痕迹。我经常想知道它会是什么。”

“Then it has nothing to do with the crime, anyhow,” said the sergeant. “But it's a rum thing all the same. Everything about this case is rum. Well, what is it now?”

“那么，无论如何，这和犯罪没有任何关系,”警官说。“但这仍然是一件奇怪的事。这件案子的一切都是假的。那么，现在是什么呢?”

The butler had given an exclamation of astonishment and was pointing at the dead man's outstretched hand.

管家惊呼了一声，指着死者伸出的手。

“They've taken his wedding ring!” he gasped.

“他们拿走了他的结婚戒指!”他喘着气说。

“What!”

“什么!”

“Yes, indeed. Master always wore his plain gold wedding ring on the little finger of his left hand. That ring with the rough nugget on it was above it, and the twisted snake ring on the third finger. There's the nugget and there's the snake, but the wedding ring is gone.”

”“是的，的确。师父总是把他的结婚戒指戴在左手的小指上。上面是那个有粗金块的戒指，第三个手指上是那个扭曲的蛇形戒指。有金块，有蛇，但结婚戒指不见了。”

“He's right,” said Barker.

“他是对的,”巴克说。

“Do you tell me,” said the sergeant, “that the wedding ring was below the other?”

“你能告诉我,”警官说，“结婚戒指在另一枚戒指的下面吗?”

“Always!”

“永远!”

“Then the murderer, or whoever it was, first took off this ring you call the nugget ring, then the wedding ring, and afterwards put the nugget ring back again.”

“然后，凶手，或者不管是谁，首先摘下这枚你称之为‘金戒指’的戒指，然后是结婚戒指，最后再把‘金戒指’放回去。”

“That is so!”

“就是这样!”

The worthy country policeman shook his head. “Seems to me the sooner we get London on to this case the better,” said he. “White Mason is a smart man. No local job has ever been too much for White Mason. It won't be long now before he is here to help us. But I expect we'll have to look to London before we are through. Anyhow, I'm not ashamed to say that it is a deal too thick for the likes of me.”
