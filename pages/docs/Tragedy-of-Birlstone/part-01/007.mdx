  title: "Chapter VII. The Solution 真相大白",
  book: "The Tragedy of Birlstone"
}

Next morning, after breakfast, we found Inspector MacDonald and White Mason seated in close consultation in the small parlour of the local police sergeant. On the table in front of them were piled a number of letters and telegrams, which they were carefully sorting and docketing. Three had been placed on one side.

第二天早上，早饭后，我们发现麦克唐纳督察和怀特梅森在当地警长的小客厅里密切磋商。在他们面前的桌子上堆放着许多信件和电报，他们正在仔细地分类和登记。一边放了三个。

“Still on the track of the elusive bicyclist?” Holmes asked cheerfully. “What is the latest news of the ruffian?”

“还在那个神出鬼没的骑自行车的人的车道上吗?”福尔摩斯高兴地问道。“那个恶棍的最新消息是什么?”

MacDonald pointed ruefully to his heap of correspondence.

麦克唐纳沮丧地指出了他的一大堆信件。

“He is at present reported from Leicester, Nottingham, Southampton, Derby, East Ham, Richmond, and fourteen other places. In three of them—East Ham, Leicester, and Liverpool—there is a clear case against him, and he has actually been arrested. The country seems to be full of the fugitives with yellow coats.”

“目前他被报道来自莱斯特、诺丁汉、南安普敦、德比、东汉、里士满和其他十四个地方。在其中的三个球队——东汉姆、莱斯特和利物浦——对他的指控很明显，而且他实际上已经被逮捕了。这个国家似乎到处都是穿着黄色外套的逃犯。”

“Dear me!” said Holmes sympathetically. “Now, Mr. Mac and you, Mr. White Mason, I wish to give you a very earnest piece of advice. When I went into this case with you I bargained, as you will no doubt remember, that I should not present you with half-proved theories, but that I should retain and work out my own ideas until I had satisfied myself that they were correct. For this reason I am not at the present moment telling you all that is in my mind. On the other hand, I said that I would play the game fairly by you, and I do not think it is a fair game to allow you for one unnecessary moment to waste your energies upon a profitless task. Therefore I am here to advise you this morning, and my advice to you is summed up in three words—abandon the case.”

“天哪!”福尔摩斯同情地说。“现在，麦克先生和你，怀特 · 梅森先生，我想给你一个非常认真的忠告。当我和你讨论这个问题的时候，我讨价还价，你一定还记得，我不应该向你提出半成品的理论，而是应该保留和研究我自己的想法，直到我确信它们是正确的。因为这个原因，我现在不能告诉你我脑子里的一切。另一方面，我说过我会公平地对待你，我不认为允许你在一个不必要的时刻把精力浪费在一个无利可图的任务上是一个公平的游戏。因此，今天上午我在这里劝告你们，我对你们的劝告可以总结为三个字: 放弃这个案子。”

MacDonald and White Mason stared in amazement at their celebrated colleague.

麦克唐纳和怀特 · 梅森惊讶地盯着他们著名的同事。

“You consider it hopeless!” cried the inspector.

“你认为没有希望了!”巡查员喊道。

“I consider your case to be hopeless. I do not consider that it is hopeless to arrive at the truth.”

“我认为你的情况是没有希望的，我不认为找到真相是没有希望的。”

“But this cyclist. He is not an invention. We have his description, his valise, his bicycle. The fellow must be somewhere. Why should we not get him?”

“但是这个骑自行车的人。他不是虚构的。我们有他的描述，他的旅行箱，他的自行车。那家伙一定在什么地方。我们为什么不能抓住他呢?”

“Yes, yes, no doubt he is somewhere, and no doubt we shall get him; but I would not have you waste your energies in East Ham or Liverpool. I am sure that we can find some shorter cut to a result.”

“是的，是的，毫无疑问他在某个地方，毫无疑问我们会抓到他的，但我不希望你在东汉姆或利物浦浪费精力。我相信，我们可以找到一些较短的解决办法。”

“You are holding something back. It's hardly fair of you, Mr. Holmes.” The inspector was annoyed.

“你隐瞒了一些事情。这对你很不公平，福尔摩斯先生。”检查员很生气。

“You know my methods of work, Mr. Mac. But I will hold it back for the shortest time possible. I only wish to verify my details in one way, which can very readily be done, and then I make my bow and return to London, leaving my results entirely at your service. I owe you too much to act otherwise; for in all my experience I cannot recall any more singular and interesting study.”

“你知道我的工作方法，麦克先生。但我会尽可能缩短时间。我只想用一种方法来核实我的详细资料，这很容易办到，然后我鞠躬回到伦敦，把我的结果完全交给你。我欠你太多，不能做别的事情，因为就我的经验来看，我再也想不出还有什么比这更奇特、更有趣的研究了。”

“This is clean beyond me, Mr. Holmes. We saw you when we returned from Tunbridge Wells last night, and you were in general agreement with our results. What has happened since then to give you a completely new idea of the case?”

“这简直超出了我的能力范围，福尔摩斯先生。昨晚我们从 Tunbridge Wells 回来的时候看到你了，你基本上同意我们的结果。从那以后发生了什么事，让你对这个案子有了全新的认识?”

“Well, since you ask me, I spent, as I told you that I would, some hours last night at the Manor House.”

“好吧，既然你问我，我告诉过你，我昨晚在庄园宅邸花了几个小时。”

“Well, what happened?”

“嗯，发生了什么事?”

“Ah, I can only give you a very general answer to that for the moment. By the way, I have been reading a short but clear and interesting account of the old building, purchasable at the modest sum of one penny from the local tobacconist.”

”“啊，目前我只能给你一个非常笼统的答复。顺便说一下，我一直在读一篇关于这座老建筑的简短而清晰而有趣的文章，这些旧建筑可以从当地的烟草商那里以一便士的价格买到。”

Here Holmes drew a small tract, embellished with a rude engraving of the ancient Manor House, from his waistcoat pocket.

福尔摩斯从他的马甲口袋里抽出一本小册子，上面装饰着一幅粗糙的古老庄园的雕刻。

“It immensely adds to the zest of an investigation, my dear Mr. Mac, when one is in conscious sympathy with the historical atmosphere of one's surroundings. Don't look so impatient; for I assure you that even so bald an account as this raises some sort of picture of the past in one's mind. Permit me to give you a sample. ‘Erected in the fifth year of the reign of James I, and standing upon the site of a much older building, the Manor House of Birlstone presents one of the finest surviving examples of the moated Jacobean residence—’ ”

“亲爱的麦克先生，当一个人有意识地同情周围的历史氛围时，这会极大地增加调查的热情。不要显得那么没有耐心，因为我向你保证，即使是这样一个如此直白的描述，也会在人们的脑海中勾起某种过去的画面。请允许我给你一个样品。“伯斯通庄园建于詹姆斯一世统治的第五年，矗立在一座古老得多的建筑上，它是现存最好的詹姆斯一世时期住宅的例子之一。”

“You are making fools of us, Mr. Holmes!”

“你在愚弄我们，福尔摩斯先生!”

“Tut, tut, Mr. Mac!—the first sign of temper I have detected in you. Well, I won't read it verbatim, since you feel so strongly upon the subject. But when I tell you that there is some account of the taking of the place by a parliamentary colonel in 1644, of the concealment of Charles for several days in the course of the Civil War, and finally of a visit there by the second George, you will admit that there are various associations of interest connected with this ancient house.”

“啧，啧，麦克先生! ——这是我在你身上发现的第一个脾气的迹象。好吧，我不会逐字逐句地读，因为你对这个主题的感觉如此强烈。但是，当我告诉你，有一些关于1644年一位议会上校占领这个地方，内战期间查尔斯被隐藏了好几天，最后第二个乔治访问那里的记载时，你就会承认，这座古老的房子与各种各样的利益关系有关。”

“I don't doubt it, Mr. Holmes; but that is no business of ours.”

“我不怀疑，福尔摩斯先生，但这不关我们的事。”

“Is it not? Is it not? Breadth of view, my dear Mr. Mac, is one of the essentials of our profession. The interplay of ideas and the oblique uses of knowledge are often of extraordinary interest. You will excuse these remarks from one who, though a mere connoisseur of crime, is still rather older and perhaps more experienced than yourself.”

”“不是吗？不是吗？亲爱的麦克先生，眼界的宽广是我们这个职业的基本要素之一。思想之间的相互作用和知识的间接用途常常引起人们极大的兴趣。你可以原谅一个人的这些话，他虽然只是一个鉴赏犯罪的行家，但却比你年长得多，也许比你更有经验。”

“I'm the first to admit that,” said the detective heartily. “You get to your point, I admit; but you have such a deuced round-the-corner way of doing it.”

“我是第一个承认这一点的人,”侦探衷心地说。“我承认，你说到点子上了，但是你做这件事的方法真是不可思议。”

“Well, well, I'll drop past history and get down to present-day facts. I called last night, as I have already said, at the Manor House. I did not see either Barker or Mrs. Douglas. I saw no necessity to disturb them; but I was pleased to hear that the lady was not visibly pining and that she had partaken of an excellent dinner. My visit was specially made to the good Mr. Ames, with whom I exchanged some amiabilities, which culminated in his allowing me, without reference to anyone else, to sit alone for a time in the study.”

”“好吧，好吧，我将抛开过去的历史，谈谈现在的事实。我昨晚打电话到庄园去了，我已经说过了。我没有看到巴克或道格拉斯太太。我认为没有必要打扰他们，但是我很高兴听到那位女士并没有显得憔悴，而且她已经享受了一顿丰盛的晚餐。我是专门拜访好心的艾姆斯先生的，我和他交换了一些友好的意见，最后他允许我在书房里独自坐一会儿，而不向任何人打听。”

“What! With that?” I ejaculated.

“什么! 用那个?”我射了出来。

“No, no, everything is now in order. You gave permission for that, Mr. Mac, as I am informed. The room was in its normal state, and in it I passed an instructive quarter of an hour.”

“不，不，现在一切正常。据我所知，麦克先生，你允许这样做的。房间里一切正常，我在里面度过了有益的一刻钟。”

“What were you doing?”

“你在干什么?”

“Well, not to make a mystery of so simple a matter, I was looking for the missing dumb-bell. It has always bulked rather large in my estimate of the case. I ended by finding it.”

“好吧，不要把这么简单的事情搞得神秘兮兮的，我是在找那个丢失的哑铃。我对这件案子的估计总是偏大。最后我找到了它。”

“Where?”

“在哪儿?”

“Ah, there we come to the edge of the unexplored. Let me go a little further, a very little further, and I will promise that you shall share everything that I know.”

“啊，我们来到了未知世界的边缘。让我再深入一点，再深入一点，我保证你会把我所知道的一切都告诉大家。”

“Well, we're bound to take you on your own terms,” said the inspector; “but when it comes to telling us to abandon the case—why in the name of goodness should we abandon the case?”

“好吧，我们一定会按照你自己的条件接受你的,”巡查员说，“但是，到了要我们放弃这个案子的时候ーー为什么我们要以上帝的名义放弃这个案子呢?”

“For the simple reason, my dear Mr. Mac, that you have not got the first idea what it is that you are investigating.”

“亲爱的麦克先生，原因很简单，你不知道你在调查什么。”

“We are investigating the murder of Mr. John Douglas of Birlstone Manor.”

“我们正在调查伯尔斯通庄园的约翰 · 道格拉斯先生的谋杀案。”

“Yes, yes, so you are. But don't trouble to trace the mysterious gentleman upon the bicycle. I assure you that it won't help you.”

”“是的，是的，你是。但是不要费力去追踪那个骑自行车的神秘先生。我向你保证，这对你毫无帮助。”

“Then what do you suggest that we do?”

“那你建议我们怎么做?”

“I will tell you exactly what to do, if you will do it.”

“如果你愿意的话，我会告诉你该怎么做。”

“Well, I'm bound to say I've always found you had reason behind all your queer ways. I'll do what you advise.”

”“好吧，我得说，我一直觉得你那些古怪的行为背后是有原因的。我会照你说的做。”

“And you, Mr. White Mason?”

“你呢，怀特 · 梅森先生?”

The country detective looked helplessly from one to the other. Holmes and his methods were new to him. “Well, if it is good enough for the inspector, it is good enough for me,” he said at last.

那个乡下侦探无助地四处张望。福尔摩斯和他的方法对他来说是全新的。“好吧，如果对检查员来说足够好的话，对我来说就足够好了,”他最后说。

“Capital!” said Holmes. “Well, then, I should recommend a nice, cheery country walk for both of you. They tell me that the views from Birlstone Ridge over the Weald are very remarkable. No doubt lunch could be got at some suitable hostelry; though my ignorance of the country prevents me from recommending one. In the evening, tired but happy—”

“太好了!”福尔摩斯说。”“那么，我建议你们两个去一个舒适愉快的乡间散步。他们告诉我，从伯尔斯通岭俯瞰威尔德的景色非常壮观。毫无疑问，在一些合适的旅馆里可以吃到午饭，尽管由于我对乡下的无知，我不能推荐一家。在晚上，疲惫但快乐——”

“Man, this is getting past a joke!” cried MacDonald, rising angrily from his chair.

“伙计，这不是开玩笑!”麦克唐纳从椅子上愤怒地站起来喊道。

“Well, well, spend the day as you like,” said Holmes, patting him cheerfully upon the shoulder. “Do what you like and go where you will, but meet me here before dusk without fail—without fail, Mr. Mac.”

“好吧，好吧，你想怎么过就怎么过吧,”福尔摩斯说着，愉快地拍了拍他的肩膀。“你爱干什么就干什么，想去哪儿就去哪儿，但黄昏之前一定要在这里见到我，一定要见到，麦克先生。”

“That sounds more like sanity.”

“这听起来更像是理智。”

“All of it was excellent advice; but I don't insist, so long as you are here when I need you. But now, before we part, I want you to write a note to Mr. Barker.”

”“所有这些都是很好的建议，但是我不坚持，只要我需要你的时候你在这里。但是现在，在我们分手之前，我要你给巴克先生写一封信。”

“Well?”

“嗯?”

“I'll dictate it, if you like. Ready?

“如果你愿意，我来口述，准备好了吗？

“Dear Sir:

“亲爱的先生:

“It has struck me that it is our duty to drain the moat, in the hope that we may find some—“

“我突然想到，排干护城河的水是我们的责任，希望我们能找到一些 --”

“It's impossible,” said the inspector. “I've made inquiry.”

“这不可能,”巡查员说，“我已经调查过了。”

“Tut, tut! My dear sir, please do what I ask you.”

“啧，啧! 我亲爱的先生，请照我说的做。”

“Well, go on.”

“好吧，继续。”

“—in the hope that we may find something which may bear upon our investigation. I have made arrangements, and the workmen will be at work early to-morrow morning diverting the stream—“

“-希望我们能找到一些对我们的调查有用的东西。我已经安排好了，明天一大早工人们就要开始工作了

“Impossible!”

“不可能!”

“—diverting the stream; so I thought it best to explain matters beforehand.

“——改变小溪的流向，所以我想最好事先解释一下。

“Now sign that, and send it by hand about four o'clock. At that hour we shall meet again in this room. Until then we may each do what we like; for I can assure you that this inquiry has come to a definite pause.”

”“现在把这个签了，大约四点钟左右亲手送来。到那时我们将在这个房间里再见面。在那之前，我们各自可以做自己喜欢的事情，因为我可以向你保证，这个问题已经完全停顿下来了。”

Evening was drawing in when we reassembled. Holmes was very serious in his manner, myself curious, and the detectives obviously critical and annoyed.

当我们重新集合的时候，夜幕降临了。福尔摩斯态度非常严肃，我自己也很好奇，侦探们显然很挑剔，也很恼火。

“Well, gentlemen,” said my friend gravely, “I am asking you now to put everything to the test with me, and you will judge for yourselves whether the observations I have made justify the conclusions to which I have come. It is a chill evening, and I do not know how long our expedition may last; so I beg that you will wear your warmest coats. It is of the first importance that we should be in our places before it grows dark; so with your permission we shall get started at once.”

“好了，先生们,”我的朋友严肃地说，“我现在请你们和我一起检验一切，你们自己判断我的观察是否证明我得出的结论是正确的。这是一个寒冷的夜晚，我不知道我们的远征能持续多久，所以我请求你们穿上最暖和的外套。在天黑之前我们必须各就各位，这是头等大事，所以如果你允许的话，我们马上就动身。”

We passed along the outer bounds of the Manor House park until we came to a place where there was a gap in the rails which fenced it. Through this we slipped, and then in the gathering gloom we followed Holmes until we had reached a shrubbery which lies nearly opposite to the main door and the drawbridge. The latter had not been raised. Holmes crouched down behind the screen of laurels, and we all three followed his example.

我们穿过了庄园公园的外围，来到一个地方，在围栏上有一个缺口。我们从这里溜了进去，在越来越浓的黑暗中，我们跟着福尔摩斯，来到了一片灌木林，它几乎就在大门和吊桥的对面。后者没有提出来。福尔摩斯蹲在月桂树的屏风后面，我们三个人都以他为榜样。

“Well, what are we to do now?” asked MacDonald with some gruffness.

“那么，我们现在该怎么办?”麦克唐纳有些生硬地问道。

“Possess our souls in patience and make as little noise as possible,” Holmes answered.

“请保持我们的灵魂的耐心，并且尽量不要制造噪音,”福尔摩斯回答说。

“What are we here for at all? I really think that you might treat us with more frankness.”

“我们来这里到底是为了什么? 我真的认为你应该更坦诚地对待我们。”

Holmes laughed. “Watson insists that I am the dramatist in real life,” said he. “Some touch of the artist wells up within me, and calls insistently for a well-staged performance. Surely our profession, Mr. Mac, would be a drab and sordid one if we did not sometimes set the scene so as to glorify our results. The blunt accusation, the brutal tap upon the shoulder—what can one make of such a dénouement? But the quick inference, the subtle trap, the clever forecast of coming events, the triumphant vindication of bold theories—are these not the pride and the justification of our life's work? At the present moment you thrill with the glamour of the situation and the anticipation of the hunt. Where would be that thrill if I had been as definite as a timetable? I only ask a little patience, Mr. Mac, and all will be clear to you.”

福尔摩斯笑了。“沃森坚持认为我是现实生活中的剧作家,”他说。“艺术家的一些想法涌上我的心头，坚持要求上演一场精彩的表演。毫无疑问，我们的职业，麦克先生，将是一个单调和肮脏的，如果我们不有时设置场景，以美化我们的结果。直言不讳的指责，粗暴的拍打肩膀ーー我们该如何理解这样的结局？但是，快速的推断、微妙的陷阱、对即将发生的事件的巧妙预测、大胆理论的胜利证明，这些难道不是我们毕生工作的骄傲和理由吗？此时此刻，你为这种情况的魅力和对狩猎的期待而激动不已。如果我像时间表一样明确，那还有什么可激动的呢？我只要求你稍微耐心一点，麦克先生，你就会明白了。”

“Well, I hope the pride and justification and the rest of it will come before we all get our death of cold,” said the London detective with comic resignation.

“好吧，我希望在我们都感冒死去之前，我们的自豪感、正当理由以及其他的一切都会到来,”这位伦敦侦探以漫画般的辞职口吻说。

We all had good reason to join in the aspiration; for our vigil was a long and bitter one. Slowly the shadows darkened over the long, sombre face of the old house. A cold, damp reek from the moat chilled us to the bones and set our teeth chattering. There was a single lamp over the gateway and a steady globe of light in the fatal study. Everything else was dark and still.

我们都有充分的理由加入这个渴望，因为我们的守夜是漫长而痛苦的。阴影慢慢地笼罩在这所老房子阴郁的长脸上。护城河里又冷又湿的臭气刺骨，使我们的牙齿打战。大门上方只有一盏灯，在这个致命的书房里有一个稳定的光球。其他的一切都是黑暗而安静的。

“How long is this to last?” asked the inspector finally. “And what is it we are watching for?”

“这要持续多久?”巡查员终于问道。“我们在看什么?”

“I have no more notion than you how long it is to last,” Holmes answered with some asperity. “If criminals would always schedule their movements like railway trains, it would certainly be more convenient for all of us. As to what it is we—Well, that's what we are watching for!”

“我和你一样不知道这种情况要持续多久,”福尔摩斯带着几分严厉的口吻回答。“如果犯罪分子总是像铁路列车那样安排他们的行动，对我们所有人来说肯定会更方便。至于我们到底是什么，那就是我们正在关注的!”

As he spoke the bright, yellow light in the study was obscured by somebody passing to and fro before it. The laurels among which we lay were immediately opposite the window and not more than a hundred feet from it. Presently it was thrown open with a whining of hinges, and we could dimly see the dark outline of a man's head and shoulders looking out into the gloom. For some minutes he peered forth in furtive, stealthy fashion, as one who wishes to be assured that he is unobserved. Then he leaned forward, and in the intense silence we were aware of the soft lapping of agitated water. He seemed to be stirring up the moat with something which he held in his hand. Then suddenly he hauled something in as a fisherman lands a fish—some large, round object which obscured the light as it was dragged through the open casement.

当他说话的时候，书房里明亮的黄色灯光被前面走来走去的人遮住了。我们躺着的月桂树正对着窗户，离窗户不到一百英尺。不一会儿，门就开了，门上的铰链发出嗡嗡的声音，我们隐隐约约地看见一个人的头和肩膀在黑暗中向外张望。有好几分钟，他偷偷摸摸地向外张望，好象他希望别人看不见他似的。然后他向前探了探身子，在极度的寂静中，我们听到了激动的海水轻轻拍打的声音。他似乎在用手里拿着的什么东西搅动护城河。突然，当一个渔夫拉上一条鱼时，他拉了进来一些东西——一些巨大的圆形物体，当光线被拖过敞开的窗户时，它们遮住了光线。

“Now!” cried Holmes. “Now!”

“现在!”福尔摩斯叫道，“现在!”

We were all upon our feet, staggering after him with our stiffened limbs, while he ran swiftly across the bridge and rang violently at the bell. There was the rasping of bolts from the other side, and the amazed Ames stood in the entrance. Holmes brushed him aside without a word and, followed by all of us, rushed into the room which had been occupied by the man whom we had been watching.

我们都站了起来，用僵硬的四肢跟在他后面蹒跚而行，而他则迅速地跑过桥，猛烈地按铃。从另一边传来刺耳的螺栓声，惊奇的艾姆斯站在门口。福尔摩斯一言不发地把他推到一边，带着我们大家冲进了我们一直在观察的那个人的房间。

The oil lamp on the table represented the glow which we had seen from outside. It was now in the hand of Cecil Barker, who held it towards us as we entered. Its light shone upon his strong, resolute, clean-shaved face and his menacing eyes.

桌子上的油灯代表了我们从外面看到的光亮。它现在在塞西尔 · 巴克手里，我们进去时，他把它举向我们。阳光照在他那强壮、坚决、光洁的脸上，还有他那凶恶的眼睛上。

“What the devil is the meaning of all this?” he cried. “What are you after, anyhow?”

“这一切究竟是什么意思?”他喊道，“你到底想要什么?”

Holmes took a swift glance round, and then pounced upon a sodden bundle tied together with cord which lay where it had been thrust under the writing table.

福尔摩斯迅速地向四周扫了一眼，然后猛然发现了一个用绳子绑在一起的湿漉漉的包裹，它被塞在写字台下面。

“This is what we are after, Mr. Barker—this bundle, weighted with a dumb-bell, which you have just raised from the bottom of the moat.”

“巴克先生，这就是我们要找的东西——这捆东西，装着一个哑铃，你刚从护城河底下把它举起来。”

Barker stared at Holmes with amazement in his face. “How in thunder came you to know anything about it?” he asked.

巴克惊讶地盯着福尔摩斯的脸。“你是怎么知道这件事的?”他问道。

“Simply that I put it there.”

“只是我把它放在那儿了。”

“You put it there! You!”

“是你放在那儿的! 是你!”

“Perhaps I should have said ‘replaced it there,’” said Holmes. “You will remember, Inspector MacDonald, that I was somewhat struck by the absence of a dumb-bell. I drew your attention to it; but with the pressure of other events you had hardly the time to give it the consideration which would have enabled you to draw deductions from it. When water is near and a weight is missing it is not a very far-fetched supposition that something has been sunk in the water. The idea was at least worth testing; so with the help of Ames, who admitted me to the room, and the crook of Dr. Watson's umbrella, I was able last night to fish up and inspect this bundle.

“也许我应该说‘把它换掉了,”’福尔摩斯说。“麦克唐纳督察，你应该记得，我对没有哑铃感到有点吃惊。我提请你注意这件事，但是由于其他事情的压力，你几乎没有时间考虑这件事，这样你就可以从中得出一些推论。当水在附近，而一个重量不见了，这不是一个非常牵强的假设，有东西已经沉入水中。这个想法至少值得试验一下，所以在艾姆斯的帮助下，在他允许我进入房间的同时，在华生医生的伞的钩子的帮助下，我昨天晚上钓上鱼来检查这个包裹。

“It was of the first importance, however, that we should be able to prove who placed it there. This we accomplished by the very obvious device of announcing that the moat would be dried to-morrow, which had, of course, the effect that whoever had hidden the bundle would most certainly withdraw it the moment that darkness enabled him to do so. We have no less than four witnesses as to who it was who took advantage of the opportunity, and so, Mr. Barker, I think the word lies now with you.”

“然而，最重要的是，我们应该能够证明是谁把它放在那里的。我们用一种非常明显的方法来达到这个目的，那就是宣布护城河明天就干了，这当然会产生这样的效果，那就是，不管是谁藏起了这个包裹，在黑暗使他能够这样做的时候，他一定会把它拿走的。我们至少有四个证人可以证明是谁利用了这个机会，所以，巴克先生，我想现在你说了算。”

Sherlock Holmes put the sopping bundle upon the table beside the lamp and undid the cord which bound it. From within he extracted a dumb-bell, which he tossed down to its fellow in the corner. Next he drew forth a pair of boots. “American, as you perceive,” he remarked, pointing to the toes. Then he laid upon the table a long, deadly, sheathed knife. Finally he unravelled a bundle of clothing, comprising a complete set of underclothes, socks, a gray tweed suit, and a short yellow overcoat.

夏洛克 · 福尔摩斯把浸湿的包裹放在台灯旁边的桌子上，解开了捆绑它的绳子。他从里面取出一只哑铃，扔给角落里的同伴。接着，他抽出一双靴子。“美国人，如你所见,”他指着脚趾说。然后他把一把长长的、有鞘的刀子放在桌子上。最后，他解开了一捆衣服，包括一整套内衣、袜子、一套灰色斜纹软呢西装和一件黄色短大衣。

“The clothes are commonplace,” remarked Holmes, “save only the overcoat, which is full of suggestive touches.” He held it tenderly towards the light. “Here, as you perceive, is the inner pocket prolonged into the lining in such fashion as to give ample space for the truncated fowling piece. The tailor's tab is on the neck—‘Neal, Outfitter, Vermissa, U. S. A.’ I have spent an instructive afternoon in the rector's library, and have enlarged my knowledge by adding the fact that Vermissa is a flourishing little town at the head of one of the best known coal and iron valleys in the United States. I have some recollection, Mr. Barker, that you associated the coal districts with Mr. Douglas's first wife, and it would surely not be too far-fetched an inference that the V. V. upon the card by the dead body might stand for Vermissa Valley, or that this very valley which sends forth emissaries of murder may be that Valley of Fear of which we have heard. So much is fairly clear. And now, Mr. Barker, I seem to be standing rather in the way of your explanation.”

“衣服很普通,”福尔摩斯说，“除了那件充满挑逗性的大衣。”他温柔地把它举向灯光。“你看，这里的内袋延伸到衬里里面，以便给截头的鸟枪留出足够的空间。我在校长的图书馆里度过了一个颇有启发意义的下午，并通过补充说明 Vermissa 是一个繁荣的小镇，位于美国最著名的煤矿和铁矿山之一的顶端，丰富了我的知识。巴克先生，我记得你曾把煤矿区和道格拉斯先生的第一任妻子联系在一起，所以我们不难推断出，尸体旁卡片上的 v. v. 可能代表维尔米萨谷，或者我们听说过的这个派出谋杀使者的山谷可能就是恐惧谷。这么多是相当清楚的。现在，巴克先生，我似乎妨碍了你的解释。”

It was a sight to see Cecil Barker's expressive face during this exposition of the great detective. Anger, amazement, consternation, and indecision swept over it in turn. Finally he took refuge in a somewhat acrid irony.

在这位伟大的侦探的展示会上，塞西尔 · 巴克尔富有表情的面孔令人难以忘怀。愤怒、惊讶、惊愕和优柔寡断依次席卷了整个房间。最后，他用一种有点辛辣的讽刺作为自己的避难所。

“You know such a lot, Mr. Holmes, perhaps you had better tell us some more,” he sneered.

“你知道这么多，福尔摩斯先生，也许你最好再多告诉我们一些,”他冷笑着说。

“I have no doubt that I could tell you a great deal more, Mr. Barker; but it would come with a better grace from you.”

“毫无疑问，我还可以告诉你更多的东西，巴克先生，不过你要是能告诉我的话，我会感激不尽的。”

“Oh, you think so, do you? Well, all I can say is that if there's any secret here it is not my secret, and I am not the man to give it away.”

”“哦，你这么认为，是吗？好吧，我只能说，如果这里有什么秘密的话，那不是我的秘密，我不是那个泄露秘密的人。”

“Well, if you take that line, Mr. Barker,” said the inspector quietly, “we must just keep you in sight until we have the warrant and can hold you.”

“好吧，巴克先生，如果你坚持这一点,”巡查员平静地说，“我们必须一直盯着你，直到我们拿到搜查令，可以拘留你。”

“You can do what you damn please about that,” said Barker defiantly.

巴克挑衅地说: “你可以为所欲为。”。

The proceedings seemed to have come to a definite end so far as he was concerned; for one had only to look at that granite face to realize that no peine forte et dure would ever force him to plead against his will. The deadlock was broken, however, by a woman's voice. Mrs. Douglas had been standing listening at the half opened door, and now she entered the room.

在他看来，诉讼程序似乎已经结束了; 因为只要看看这张花岗岩般的脸，人们就会意识到，没有踏刑会强迫他违背自己的意愿。然而，一个女人的声音打破了僵局。道格拉斯太太一直站在半开的门边听着，现在她走进了房间。

“You have done enough for now, Cecil,” said she. “Whatever comes of it in the future, you have done enough.”

“你现在已经做得够多了，塞西尔,”她说，“不管将来会发生什么，你已经做得够多了。”

“Enough and more than enough,” remarked Sherlock Holmes gravely. “I have every sympathy with you, madam, and should strongly urge you to have some confidence in the common sense of our jurisdiction and to take the police voluntarily into your complete confidence. It may be that I am myself at fault for not following up the hint which you conveyed to me through my friend, Dr. Watson; but, at that time I had every reason to believe that you were directly concerned in the crime. Now I am assured that this is not so. At the same time, there is much that is unexplained, and I should strongly recommend that you ask Mr. Douglas to tell us his own story.”

“够了，够了,”夏洛克 · 福尔摩斯严肃地说。”夫人，我对你深表同情，并强烈敦促你对我们司法管辖权的常识有一些信心，并自愿接受警方的完全信任。也许是我自己的错，没有按照你通过我的朋友华生医生给我的暗示去做; 但是，当时我有充分的理由相信你与这起罪行有直接的关系。现在我确信，事实并非如此。与此同时，还有许多问题无法解释，我强烈建议你请道格拉斯先生讲讲他自己的故事。”

Mrs. Douglas gave a cry of astonishment at Holmes's words. The detectives and I must have echoed it, when we were aware of a man who seemed to have emerged from the wall, who advanced now from the gloom of the corner in which he had appeared. Mrs. Douglas turned, and in an instant her arms were round him. Barker had seized his outstretched hand.

道格拉斯太太听了福尔摩斯的话，惊讶地叫了一声。当我们看到一个人似乎从墙里出来，这时他从他出现的那个阴暗的角落里走了出来时，侦探们和我一定也表示了同样的意见。道格拉斯太太转过身来，一下子就搂住了他。巴克抓住了他伸出的手。

“It's best this way, Jack,” his wife repeated; “I am sure that it is best.”

“这是最好的办法，杰克,”他的妻子重复说，“我相信这是最好的办法。”

“Indeed, yes, Mr. Douglas,” said Sherlock Holmes, “I am sure that you will find it best.”

“的确，是的，道格拉斯先生,”夏洛克 · 福尔摩斯说，“我相信你会发现它是最好的。”

The man stood blinking at us with the dazed look of one who comes from the dark into the light. It was a remarkable face, bold gray eyes, a strong, short-clipped, grizzled moustache, a square, projecting chin, and a humorous mouth. He took a good look at us all, and then to my amazement he advanced to me and handed me a bundle of paper.

那个男人站在那里，眼睛眨着看着我们，神情茫然，就像从黑暗中走进光明中一样。那是一张非同寻常的脸，大胆的灰色眼睛，一副结实的、剪短的、灰白的胡子，方方的、突出的下巴，还有一张幽默的嘴。他仔细地看了我们一眼，然后出乎我的意料地走到我跟前，递给我一捆纸。

“I've heard of you,” said he in a voice which was not quite English and not quite American, but was altogether mellow and pleasing. “You are the historian of this bunch. Well, Dr. Watson, you've never had such a story as that pass through your hands before, and I'll lay my last dollar on that. Tell it your own way; but there are the facts, and you can't miss the public so long as you have those. I've been cooped up two days, and I've spent the daylight hours—as much daylight as I could get in that rat trap—in putting the thing into words. You're welcome to them—you and your public. There's the story of the Valley of Fear.”

“我听说过你,”他说，他的声音既不像英国人，也不像美国人，但却十分圆润悦耳。“你是这群人中的历史学家。好吧，华生医生，你以前从来没有听过这样的故事，我把最后一块钱押在这上面。你可以用你自己的方式说，但是事实是存在的，只要你有这些事实，你就不会错过公众。我已经被关了两天了，我已经把白天的时间——在那个老鼠夹里尽可能多的白天——用语言把这件事说了出来。欢迎你加入他们，你和你的公众。这就是恐惧谷的故事。”

“That's the past, Mr. Douglas,” said Sherlock Holmes quietly. “What we desire now is to hear your story of the present.”

“那都是过去的事了，道格拉斯先生,”福尔摩斯平静地说。“我们现在想听听你现在的故事。”

“You'll have it, sir,” said Douglas. “May I smoke as I talk? Well, thank you, Mr. Holmes. You're a smoker yourself, if I remember right, and you'll guess what it is to be sitting for two days with tobacco in your pocket and afraid that the smell will give you away.” He leaned against the mantelpiece and sucked at the cigar which Holmes had handed him. “I've heard of you, Mr. Holmes. I never guessed that I should meet you. But before you are through with that,” he nodded at my papers, “you will say I've brought you something fresh.”

“你会得到的，先生,”道格拉斯说。“我说话的时候可以抽烟吗？谢谢你，福尔摩斯先生。如果我没记错的话，你自己也是个烟民，你会猜到坐在那里两天，口袋里揣着烟草，害怕烟味会泄露你的秘密是什么滋味。”他靠在壁炉台上，吸着福尔摩斯递给他的雪茄。“我听说过你，福尔摩斯先生。我从来没有想到我会遇见你。“但是在你做完这件事之前,”他对我的文件点点头，“你会说我给你带来了新鲜的东西。”

Inspector MacDonald had been staring at the newcomer with the greatest amazement. “Well, this fairly beats me!” he cried at last. “If you are Mr. John Douglas of Birlstone Manor, then whose death have we been investigating for these two days, and where in the world have you sprung from now? You seemed to me to come out of the floor like a jack-in-a-box.”

麦克唐纳督察带着极大的惊奇盯着这个新来的人。“好吧，这真难倒我了!”他终于哭了。“如果你是伯尔斯通庄园的约翰 · 道格拉斯先生，那么这两天我们一直在调查他的死因，你现在究竟是从哪儿冒出来的？在我看来，你就像是从地板上跳出来的玩偶。”

“Ah, Mr. Mac,” said Holmes, shaking a reproving forefinger, “you would not read that excellent local compilation which described the concealment of King Charles. People did not hide in those days without excellent hiding places, and the hiding place that has once been used may be again. I had persuaded myself that we should find Mr. Douglas under this roof.”

“啊，麦克先生,”福尔摩斯用责备的食指说，“你不会读那本描写查尔斯国王隐瞒事实的杰出的地方汇编的。在那些日子里，没有绝佳的藏身之处的人们是不会躲藏的，而且曾经使用过的藏身之处可能会再次出现。我说服自己，我们应该在这个屋檐下找到道格拉斯先生。”

“And how long have you been playing this trick upon us, Mr. Holmes?” said the inspector angrily. “How long have you allowed us to waste ourselves upon a search that you knew to be an absurd one?”

“福尔摩斯先生，你这样捉弄我们有多久了?”督察生气地说。“你让我们浪费时间在一个你明知是荒谬的搜索上多久了?”

“Not one instant, my dear Mr. Mac. Only last night did I form my views of the case. As they could not be put to the proof until this evening, I invited you and your colleague to take a holiday for the day. Pray what more could I do? When I found the suit of clothes in the moat, it at once became apparent to me that the body we had found could not have been the body of Mr. John Douglas at all, but must be that of the bicyclist from Tunbridge Wells. No other conclusion was possible. Therefore I had to determine where Mr. John Douglas himself could be, and the balance of probability was that with the connivance of his wife and his friend he was concealed in a house which had such conveniences for a fugitive, and awaiting quieter times when he could make his final escape.”

“一刻也不行，我亲爱的麦克先生。就在昨天晚上，我才形成了对这个案子的看法。由于直到今天晚上才能证明，我邀请你和你的同事去度假一天。祈祷我还能做些什么？当我在护城河里发现那套衣服时，我立刻意识到，我们发现的尸体根本不可能是约翰 · 道格拉斯先生的尸体，而一定是那个从 Tunbridge Wells 骑自行车来的人。没有其他可能的结论。因此，我必须确定约翰 · 道格拉斯先生本人可能在哪里，而且很有可能在他妻子和朋友的默许下，他被藏在一所为逃犯提供便利的房子里，等待他最后逃跑的安静时刻。”

“Well, you figured it out about right,” said Douglas approvingly. “I thought I'd dodge your British law; for I was not sure how I stood under it, and also I saw my chance to throw these hounds once for all off my track. Mind you, from first to last I have done nothing to be ashamed of, and nothing that I would not do again; but you'll judge that for yourselves when I tell you my story. Never mind warning me, Inspector: I'm ready to stand pat upon the truth.

“好吧，你说得差不多了,”道格拉斯赞许地说。“我以为我会逃避你们英国的法律，因为我不知道我是怎么受得了它的，而且我还看到了一次把这些猎犬彻底丢出我的轨道的机会。请注意，从头到尾，我没有做过什么可羞耻的事，也没有什么我不会再做的事; 但是当我告诉你们我的故事时，你们会自己判断的。不用担心警告我，探长: 我已经准备好面对事实了。

“I'm not going to begin at the beginning. That's all there,” he indicated my bundle of papers, “and a mighty queer yarn you'll find it. It all comes down to this: That there are some men that have good cause to hate me and would give their last dollar to know that they had got me. So long as I am alive and they are alive, there is no safety in this world for me. They hunted me from Chicago to California, then they chased me out of America; but when I married and settled down in this quiet spot I thought my last years were going to be peaceable.

“我不打算从头开始。“全在这儿,”他指着我的一捆文件说，“你会发现这是一个非常奇怪的故事。归根结底就是这样: 有些男人有正当理由恨我，愿意付出最后一分钱来知道他们已经得到了我。只要我还活着，他们还活着，这个世界上就没有安全可言。他们把我从芝加哥追到加利福尼亚，然后把我赶出了美国; 但是当我结婚并在这个安静的地方安顿下来的时候，我以为我的晚年将是平静的。

“I never explained to my wife how things were. Why should I pull her into it? She would never have a quiet moment again; but would always be imagining trouble. I fancy she knew something, for I may have dropped a word here or a word there; but until yesterday, after you gentlemen had seen her, she never knew the rights of the matter. She told you all she knew, and so did Barker here; for on the night when this thing happened there was mighty little time for explanations. She knows everything now, and I would have been a wiser man if I had told her sooner. But it was a hard question, dear,” he took her hand for an instant in his own, “and I acted for the best.

“我从来没有向我妻子解释过事情的原委。我为什么要把她扯进来？她再也不会有安静的时刻了，而是总是想象着麻烦。我猜想她知道些什么，因为我可能在这儿说了一句话，或者在那儿说了一句话; 但是直到昨天，你们先生们见过她之后，她才知道这件事的真相。她把她所知道的一切都告诉了你，这里的巴克也告诉了你，因为在这件事发生的那个晚上，根本没有时间解释。她现在什么都知道了，如果我早点告诉她的话，我会更聪明一些。“但这是一个很难回答的问题，亲爱的,”他握住她的手一会儿，“我这样做是出于好意。

“Well, gentlemen, the day before these happenings I was over in Tunbridge Wells, and I got a glimpse of a man in the street. It was only a glimpse; but I have a quick eye for these things, and I never doubted who it was. It was the worst enemy I had among them all—one who has been after me like a hungry wolf after a caribou all these years. I knew there was trouble coming, and I came home and made ready for it. I guessed I'd fight through it all right on my own, my luck was a proverb in the States about '76. I never doubted that it would be with me still.

“好了，先生们，在这些事情发生的前一天，我在 Tunbridge Wells，我在街上瞥见了一个人。虽然只是瞥了一眼，但是我对这些东西的眼力很敏锐，我从来没有怀疑过他是谁。这是我在他们当中遇到的最大的敌人——这么多年来，他就像一只饥饿的狼追逐一头驯鹿一样追逐着我。我知道会有麻烦，所以我回到家，做好了应对的准备。我猜我会靠自己挺过去的---- 我的运气在美国是一句关于76年的谚语。我从来没有怀疑过它会一直伴随着我。

“I was on my guard all that next day, and never went out into the park. It's as well, or he'd have had the drop on me with that buckshot gun of his before ever I could draw on him. After the bridge was up—my mind was always more restful when that bridge was up in the evenings—I put the thing clear out of my head. I never dreamed of his getting into the house and waiting for me. But when I made my round in my dressing gown, as was my habit, I had no sooner entered the study than I scented danger. I guess when a man has had dangers in his life—and I've had more than most in my time—there is a kind of sixth sense that waves the red flag. I saw the signal clear enough, and yet I couldn't tell you why. Next instant I spotted a boot under the window curtain, and then I saw why plain enough.

“第二天我一直很警惕，从来没有去过公园。这样也好，不然我还没来得及向他开枪，他就已经用他的铅弹枪把我撂倒了。桥梁建成以后，每当夜晚桥梁建成的时候，我的心情总是更加平静，我把那些东西从我的头脑中清除掉。我做梦也没想到他会进屋来等我。但是当我穿着晨衣到处走动的时候，就像我的习惯一样，我一进书房就感觉到有危险。我猜，当一个人的一生中经历过危险ーー我这辈子经历过的危险比大多数人都要多ーー就会有某种第六感挥舞着危险的旗帜。我很清楚地看到了信号，但我不能告诉你为什么。紧接着我在窗帘下发现了一只靴子，然后我明白了为什么这么简单。

“I'd just the one candle that was in my hand; but there was a good light from the hall lamp through the open door. I put down the candle and jumped for a hammer that I'd left on the mantel. At the same moment he sprang at me. I saw the glint of a knife, and I lashed at him with the hammer. I got him somewhere; for the knife tinkled down on the floor. He dodged round the table as quick as an eel, and a moment later he'd got his gun from under his coat. I heard him cock it; but I had got hold of it before he could fire. I had it by the barrel, and we wrestled for it all ends up for a minute or more. It was death to the man that lost his grip.

“我手里只有一支蜡烛，但是大厅的灯光透过敞开的门照进来。我放下蜡烛，跳起来找我落在壁炉架上的锤子。就在这时，他突然向我扑过来。我看见一把刀闪闪发光，就用锤子猛击他。我把他放在什么地方了，因为刀子叮叮当当地落在地板上。他像鳗鱼一样快速地躲过了桌子，过了一会儿，他从外套下面拿出了枪。我听见他扣动扳机，但是在他开枪之前我已经拿到了。我抓住了它的大桶，我们为了这一切努力了一分钟或更长时间。那个失去控制的人死了。

“He never lost his grip; but he got it butt downward for a moment too long. Maybe it was I that pulled the trigger. Maybe we just jolted it off between us. Anyhow, he got both barrels in the face, and there I was, staring down at all that was left of Ted Baldwin. I'd recognized him in the township, and again when he sprang for me; but his own mother wouldn't recognize him as I saw him then. I'm used to rough work; but I fairly turned sick at the sight of him.

“他从来没有失去抓地力，但是他把它向下压了一会儿，时间太长了。也许是我开的枪。也许我们只是把它从我们中间摇走了。不管怎样，他的脸上挨了两枪，我就在那儿，低头看着泰德 · 鲍德温留下的一切。我在镇上认出了他，当他跳到我面前的时候，我又认出了他; 但是他自己的母亲不会认出我当时看到的他。我习惯于粗活，但一见到他我就觉得恶心。

“I was hanging on the side of the table when Barker came hurrying down. I heard my wife coming, and I ran to the door and stopped her. It was no sight for a woman. I promised I'd come to her soon. I said a word or two to Barker—he took it all in at a glance—and we waited for the rest to come along. But there was no sign of them. Then we understood that they could hear nothing, and that all that had happened was known only to ourselves.

“当时我正吊在桌子的一边，巴克尔匆忙走了下来。我听到我妻子来了，我跑到门口拦住了她。对于一个女人来说，这是不可能的。我答应过很快就去找她。我对巴克说了一两句话ーー他一目了然ーー我们就等着其他人来。但是没有他们的踪迹。这时我们才明白，他们什么也听不见，所发生的一切只有我们自己知道。

“It was at that instant that the idea came to me. I was fairly dazzled by the brilliance of it. The man's sleeve had slipped up and there was the branded mark of the lodge upon his forearm. See here!”

“就在那一刻，我想到了这个主意。我被它的光彩迷住了。那人的袖子滑了一下，他的前臂上有旅馆的烙印。看这里!”

The man whom we had known as Douglas turned up his own coat and cuff to show a brown triangle within a circle exactly like that which we had seen upon the dead man.

我们所知道的那个叫道格拉斯的人翻起自己的外套和袖口，露出一个圆圈里的棕色三角形，和我们在死者身上看到的一模一样。

“It was the sight of that which started me on it. I seemed to see it all clear at a glance. There were his height and hair and figure, about the same as my own. No one could swear to his face, poor devil! I brought down this suit of clothes, and in a quarter of an hour Barker and I had put my dressing gown on him and he lay as you found him. We tied all his things into a bundle, and I weighted them with the only weight I could find and put them through the window. The card he had meant to lay upon my body was lying beside his own.

“正是看到这一幕，我才开始这么想。我似乎一眼就看清了一切。他的身高、头发和身材都和我差不多。没有人能当着他的面发誓，可怜的家伙！我拿下这套衣服，一刻钟后，巴克和我给他穿上睡衣，他就像你们发现他时那样躺着。我们把他所有的东西捆成一捆，我用我能找到的唯一重物称了一下，然后把它们放进窗户里。他打算放在我身上的那张牌就在他身边。

“My rings were put on his finger; but when it came to the wedding ring,” he held out his muscular hand, “you can see for yourselves that I had struck the limit. I have not moved it since the day I was married, and it would have taken a file to get it off. I don't know, anyhow, that I should have cared to part with it; but if I had wanted to I couldn't. So we just had to leave that detail to take care of itself. On the other hand, I brought a bit of plaster down and put it where I am wearing one myself at this instant. You slipped up there, Mr. Holmes, clever as you are; for if you had chanced to take off that plaster you would have found no cut underneath it.

“我的戒指是戴在他的手指上的，但是当他戴上结婚戒指的时候,”他伸出肌肉发达的手，“你们可以亲眼看到我已经到了极限。自从我结婚那天起我就没有移动过它，而且它需要一个文件才能取下来。无论如何，我不知道我是否应该舍弃它; 但是如果我想的话，我不能。所以我们只能把这些细节留给自己处理。另一方面，我带来了一点石膏下来，并把它的地方，我正在穿着一个自己在这一刻。福尔摩斯先生，你在上面滑了一跤，尽管你很聪明，因为如果你碰巧把那块石膏取下来，你就不会发现它下面有任何伤口。

“Well, that was the situation. If I could lie low for a while and then get away where I could be joined by my ‘widow’ we should have a chance at last of living in peace for the rest of our lives. These devils would give me no rest so long as I was above ground; but if they saw in the papers that Baldwin had got his man, there would be an end of all my troubles. I hadn't much time to make it all clear to Barker and to my wife; but they understood enough to be able to help me. I knew all about this hiding place, so did Ames; but it never entered his head to connect it with the matter. I retired into it, and it was up to Barker to do the rest.

“嗯，情况就是这样。如果我可以隐藏一段时间，然后离开那里，我可以加入我的“寡妇”，我们应该有一个机会在我们的余生在和平的生活。只要我还在地上，这些魔鬼就不会让我休息; 但是如果他们在报纸上看到鲍德温抓住了他的人，我所有的烦恼就都结束了。我没有太多的时间向巴克和我的妻子解释清楚，但是他们足够理解，能够帮助我。我知道这个地方的一切，艾姆斯也知道; 但是他从来没有想到过要把它和这件事联系起来。我退回去，剩下的就交给巴克了。

“I guess you can fill in for yourselves what he did. He opened the window and made the mark on the sill to give an idea of how the murderer escaped. It was a tall order, that; but as the bridge was up there was no other way. Then, when everything was fixed, he rang the bell for all he was worth. What happened afterward you know. And so, gentlemen, you can do what you please; but I've told you the truth and the whole truth, so help me God! What I ask you now is how do I stand by the English law?”

“我想你们可以自己代替他的工作。他打开窗户，在窗台上做了记号，以便了解凶手是如何逃脱的。这是一项艰巨的任务，但是由于桥在上面，没有别的路可走。然后，当一切都修好了，他按响了门铃，尽了他所有的价值。你知道后来发生了什么。所以，先生们，你们可以做你们喜欢做的事情; 但是我已经告诉你们事实和全部的事实，上帝保佑我！我现在要问你的是，我如何遵守英国法律?”

There was a silence which was broken by Sherlock Holmes.

一阵沉默被夏洛克 · 福尔摩斯打破了。

“The English law is in the main a just law. You will get no worse than your deserts from that, Mr. Douglas. But I would ask you how did this man know that you lived here, or how to get into your house, or where to hide to get you?”

“英国法律基本上是公正的法律。道格拉斯先生，你不会得到比你应得的惩罚更坏的惩罚。但是我想问你，这个人是怎么知道你住在这里的，怎么进入你的房子，怎么躲到哪里去接你?”

“I know nothing of this.”

“我对此一无所知。”

Holmes's face was very white and grave. “The story is not over yet, I fear,” said he. “You may find worse dangers than the English law, or even than your enemies from America. I see trouble before you, Mr. Douglas. You'll take my advice and still be on your guard.”

福尔摩斯的脸色苍白，显得很严肃。“恐怕故事还没有结束,”他说。“你可能会发现比英国法律更糟糕的危险，甚至比你来自美国的敌人还要危险。我看你有麻烦了，道格拉斯先生。你可以听我的劝告，但仍然要提高警惕。”

And now, my long-suffering readers, I will ask you to come away with me for a time, far from the Sussex Manor House of Birlstone, and far also from the year of grace in which we made our eventful journey which ended with the strange story of the man who had been known as John Douglas. I wish you to journey back some twenty years in time, and westward some thousands of miles in space, that I may lay before you a singular and terrible narrative—so singular and so terrible that you may find it hard to believe that even as I tell it, even so did it occur.

现在，我的长期受苦的读者们，我请求你们和我一起离开一段时间，远离伯尔斯通的苏塞克斯庄园，也远离我们多事之年的恩典，我们的旅程以一个叫做约翰 · 道格拉斯的人的奇怪故事结束。我希望你们能回到二十年前，在太空中向西行进几千英里，这样我就可以在你们面前展示一个奇特而可怕的故事ーー如此奇特而可怕，以至于你们可能很难相信，即使我这样讲述，它也确实发生了。

Do not think that I intrude one story before another is finished. As you read on you will find that this is not so. And when I have detailed those distant events and you have solved this mystery of the past, we shall meet once more in those rooms on Baker Street, where this, like so many other wonderful happenings, will find its end.

不要以为我在一个故事讲完之前就闯入另一个故事。当你继续读下去，你会发现事实并非如此。当我详述了那些遥远的事件，你也解开了过去的谜团，我们将在贝克街的那些房间里再次见面，在那里，这一切，就像许多其他美好的事件一样，都将走到尽头。
