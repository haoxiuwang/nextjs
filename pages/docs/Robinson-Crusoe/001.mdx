  title: "CHAPTER I. START IN LIFE",
  book: "Robinson Crusoe"
}

I was born in the year 1632, in the city of York, of a good family, though not of that country, my father being a foreigner of Bremen, who settled first at Hull. He got a good estate by merchandise, and leaving off his trade, lived afterwards at York, from whence he had married my mother, whose relations were named Robinson, a very good family in that country, and from whom I was called Robinson Kreutznaer; but, by the usual corruption of words in England, we are now called—nay we call ourselves and write our name—Crusoe; and so my companions always called me.

I had two elder brothers, one of whom was lieutenant-colonel to an English regiment of foot in Flanders, formerly commanded by the famous Colonel Lockhart, and was killed at the battle near Dunkirk against the Spaniards. What became of my second brother I never knew, any more than my father or mother knew what became of me.

Being the third son of the family and not bred to any trade, my head began to be filled very early with rambling thoughts. My father, who was very ancient, had given me a competent share of learning, as far as house-education and a country free school generally go, and designed me for the law; but I would be satisfied with nothing but going to sea; and my inclination to this led me so strongly against the will, nay, the commands of my father, and against all the entreaties and persuasions of my mother and other friends, that there seemed to be something fatal in that propensity of nature, tending directly to the life of misery which was to befall me.

作为家里的第三个儿子，没有受过任何职业教育，我的头脑很早就开始充满杂乱无章的想法。我的父亲是个很古老的人，他给了我一些有用的知识，至于家庭教育和乡村免费学校，他把我培养成法律人才; 但是我只要出海就满足了; 我这样做的倾向使我强烈地违背了父亲的意愿，不，违背了父亲的命令，也违背了母亲和其他朋友的一切恳求和劝说，使我觉得这种天性中似乎有某种致命的东西，直接导致了我将要遭受的痛苦的生活。

My father, a wise and grave man, gave me serious and excellent counsel against what he foresaw was my design. He called me one morning into his chamber, where he was confined by the gout, and expostulated very warmly with me upon this subject. He asked me what reasons, more than a mere wandering inclination, I had for leaving father’s house and my native country, where I might be well introduced, and had a prospect of raising my fortune by application and industry, with a life of ease and pleasure. He told me it was men of desperate fortunes on one hand, or of aspiring, superior fortunes on the other, who went abroad upon adventures, to rise by enterprise, and make themselves famous in undertakings of a nature out of the common road; that these things were all either too far above me or too far below me; that mine was the middle state, or what might be called the upper station of low life, which he had found, by long experience, was the best state in the world, the most suited to human happiness, not exposed to the miseries and hardships, the labour and sufferings of the mechanic part of mankind, and not embarrassed with the pride, luxury, ambition, and envy of the upper part of mankind. He told me I might judge of the happiness of this state by this one thing—viz. that this was the state of life which all other people envied; that kings have frequently lamented the miserable consequence of being born to great things, and wished they had been placed in the middle of the two extremes, between the mean and the great; that the wise man gave his testimony to this, as the standard of felicity, when he prayed to have neither poverty nor riches.

我的父亲，一个睿智而严肃的人，给了我严肃而出色的忠告，反对他所预见的我的计划。一天早晨，他把我叫到他的房间里，因为痛风的缘故，他把我关在里面，热情地劝我谈这个问题。他问我为什么要离开父亲的家，离开祖国，在那里我可以得到很好的介绍，并且有希望通过勤奋和勤奋来发财，过上安逸愉快的生活。他告诉我，一方面是那些穷途末路的人，另一方面是那些胸怀大志的人，他们到国外冒险，奋发图强，在一些非同寻常的事业上出人头地; 他说，这些事情要么在我之上，要么在我之下;我的是中间状态，或者可以称之为下层生活的上层状态，根据他的长期经验，他发现这是世界上最好的状态，最适合人类的幸福，不会遭受人类机械部分的苦难和劳动，也不会因为人类上层的骄傲、奢侈、野心和嫉妒而感到尴尬。他告诉我，我可以通过这一件事来判断这种状态的幸福。这就是所有其他人都羡慕的生活状态; 国王常常哀叹出身于伟大事业的悲惨后果，并希望自己被置于两个极端之间，介于中庸和伟大之间; 当智者祈求既没有贫穷也没有财富时，他对此作出了证明，作为幸福的标准。

He bade me observe it, and I should always find that the calamities of life were shared among the upper and lower part of mankind, but that the middle station had the fewest disasters, and was not exposed to so many vicissitudes as the higher or lower part of mankind; nay, they were not subjected to so many distempers and uneasinesses, either of body or mind, as those were who, by vicious living, luxury, and extravagances on the one hand, or by hard labour, want of necessaries, and mean or insufficient diet on the other hand, bring distemper upon themselves by the natural consequences of their way of living; that the middle station of life was calculated for all kind of virtue and all kind of enjoyments; that peace and plenty were the handmaids of a middle fortune; that temperance, moderation, quietness, health, society, all agreeable diversions, and all desirable pleasures, were the blessings attending the middle station of life; that this way men went silently and smoothly through the world, and comfortably out of it, not embarrassed with the labours of the hands or of the head, not sold to a life of slavery for daily bread, nor harassed with perplexed circumstances, which rob the soul of peace and the body of rest, nor enraged with the passion of envy, or the secret burning lust of ambition for great things; but, in easy circumstances, sliding gently through the world, and sensibly tasting the sweets of living, without the bitter; feeling that they are happy, and learning by every day’s experience to know it more sensibly.

他吩咐我观察它，我总会发现人类的上层和下层分担了生活的灾难，但是中层社会灾难最少，没有人类的上层和下层社会那么多的沧桑;不仅如此，他们也没有遭受过那么多身体或精神上的困扰和不安，因为他们一方面过着恶劣的生活，过着奢侈的生活，挥霍无度，或者辛苦劳动，缺乏生活必需品，另一方面又缺乏或不足的饮食，使他们自己因为生活方式的自然后果而感到心烦意乱;生活的中间地位是为了各种美德和各种享乐而设计的; 和平与富足是中等财富的侍女; 节制、中庸、安静、健康、社交、一切愉快的消遣和一切理想的快乐，是生活中间地位所带来的祝福;这样，人们就可以安静、顺利地穿过世界，舒服地离开这个世界，不会因为手头的劳动而感到尴尬，不会因为日常的面包而被卖给奴隶生活，不会因为困惑的境遇而心神不宁，不会因为嫉妒的激情而愤怒，不会因为对伟大事业的渴望而秘密燃烧;但是，在轻松的情况下，在世界上轻轻滑动，明智地品尝生活的甜蜜，没有苦涩，感觉自己是幸福的，并从每天的经验中学习更明智地了解它。

After this he pressed me earnestly, and in the most affectionate manner, not to play the young man, nor to precipitate myself into miseries which nature, and the station of life I was born in, seemed to have provided against; that I was under no necessity of seeking my bread; that he would do well for me, and endeavour to enter me fairly into the station of life which he had just been recommending to me; and that if I was not very easy and happy in the world, it must be my mere fate or fault that must hinder it; and that he should have nothing to answer for, having thus discharged his duty in warning me against measures which he knew would be to my hurt; in a word, that as he would do very kind things for me if I would stay and settle at home as he directed, so he would not have so much hand in my misfortunes as to give me any encouragement to go away; and to close all, he told me I had my elder brother for an example, to whom he had used the same earnest persuasions to keep him from going into the Low Country wars, but could not prevail, his young desires prompting him to run into the army, where he was killed; and though he said he would not cease to pray for me, yet he would venture to say to me, that if I did take this foolish step, God would not bless me, and I should have leisure hereafter to reflect upon having neglected his counsel when there might be none to assist in my recovery.

在这之后，他用最热情的方式恳求我，不要扮演那个年轻人，也不要把自己沉浸在自然和我出生时的生活状况似乎所反对的痛苦之中，不要让我不得不去找我的面包，不要让他为我做好事，不要让我陷入他刚才向我推荐的那种生活状态;如果我在这个世界上不是那么容易和快乐，那么一定是我的命运或过错阻碍了它; 他既然已经履行了他的职责，警告我不要采取他知道会伤害我的措施，那么他就没有什么可以回答的了; 总之，如果我按照他的指示留在家里安顿下来，他就会对我非常好，这样他就不会把我的不幸牵扯进来，以至于给我任何离开的鼓励;最后，他告诉我，我以我的哥哥为例，他曾经用同样的诚挚的劝告阻止他参加低地国家的战争，但是没有成功，他年轻的欲望促使他参军，在那里他被杀害了; 虽然他说他不会停止为我祈祷，但是他会冒昧地对我说，如果我做了这个愚蠢的一步，上帝不会祝福我，而且我以后应该有闲暇时间考虑忽视他的建议，可能没有人帮助我康复。

I observed in this last part of his discourse, which was truly prophetic, though I suppose my father did not know it to be so himself—I say, I observed the tears run down his face very plentifully, especially when he spoke of my brother who was killed: and that when he spoke of my having leisure to repent, and none to assist me, he was so moved that he broke off the discourse, and told me his heart was so full he could say no more to me.

我说，我注意到他脸上流满了泪水，特别是当他谈到我被杀死的兄弟时; 当他谈到我有闲暇忏悔，而且没有人帮助我时，他非常感动，中断了他的谈话，告诉我他的心是如此充实，他不能再对我说话了。

I was sincerely affected with this discourse, and, indeed, who could be otherwise? and I resolved not to think of going abroad any more, but to settle at home according to my father’s desire. But alas! a few days wore it all off; and, in short, to prevent any of my father’s further importunities, in a few weeks after I resolved to run quite away from him. However, I did not act quite so hastily as the first heat of my resolution prompted; but I took my mother at a time when I thought her a little more pleasant than ordinary, and told her that my thoughts were so entirely bent upon seeing the world that I should never settle to anything with resolution enough to go through with it, and my father had better give me his consent than force me to go without it; that I was now eighteen years old, which was too late to go apprentice to a trade or clerk to an attorney; that I was sure if I did I should never serve out my time, but I should certainly run away from my master before my time was out, and go to sea; and if she would speak to my father to let me go one voyage abroad, if I came home again, and did not like it, I would go no more; and I would promise, by a double diligence, to recover the time that I had lost.

我真的被这番话深深地感动了，而且，说实在的，还有谁能不这样呢？我决定不再考虑出国，而是按照父亲的意愿在家里安顿下来。但是，唉！过了几天，一切都过去了; 简而言之，在我决定离开他几个星期之后，为了避免父亲进一步的纠缠。然而，我并没有像我决心的第一个热度那样仓促行事，而是在我认为我母亲比平时更加愉快一些的时候，我把她带到我身边，告诉她我的思想是如此专注于观察这个世界，我决不会满足于任何决心去完成它，我父亲最好同意我这样做，而不是强迫我不这样做;我现在已经十八岁了，为时已晚，不能再去当贸易学徒或律师办事员了; 我确信如果我做了，我就永远不会服满刑期，但是我肯定会在我的时间结束之前离开我的主人，出海去; 如果她愿意跟我父亲说，如果我再次回到家里，而且不喜欢这样，我就不再出海了; 我会加倍努力地保证，弥补我失去的时间。

This put my mother into a great passion; she told me she knew it would be to no purpose to speak to my father upon any such subject; that he knew too well what was my interest to give his consent to anything so much for my hurt; and that she wondered how I could think of any such thing after the discourse I had had with my father, and such kind and tender expressions as she knew my father had used to me; and that, in short, if I would ruin myself, there was no help for me; but I might depend I should never have their consent to it; that for her part she would not have so much hand in my destruction; and I should never have it to say that my mother was willing when my father was not.

这使我母亲产生了极大的激情; 她告诉我，她知道就这样的事情和我父亲谈话是没有意义的; 他非常清楚，为了我的伤害，我为什么要同意他做这样的事情; 她想知道，在我和我父亲谈过话之后，在她知道我父亲曾经对我做过这样亲切而温柔的表情之后，我怎么会想到这样的事情; 简而言之，如果我要毁了自己，对我来说就没有任何帮助; 但是我可以依靠我永远不会得到他们的同意; 就她而言，她不会那么多地插手我的毁灭; 我永远不会说，我父亲不在的时候，我母亲是愿意的。

Though my mother refused to move it to my father, yet I heard afterwards that she reported all the discourse to him, and that my father, after showing a great concern at it, said to her, with a sigh, “That boy might be happy if he would stay at home; but if he goes abroad, he will be the most miserable wretch that ever was born: I can give no consent to it.”

虽然我母亲拒绝把它移交给我父亲，但是后来我听说她把所有的事情都告诉了他，而且我父亲在表示了极大的关心之后，叹了口气，对她说: “如果那个男孩留在家里，他可能会高兴; 但是如果他出国，他将是有史以来最可悲的可怜虫: 我不能同意。”

It was not till almost a year after this that I broke loose, though, in the meantime, I continued obstinately deaf to all proposals of settling to business, and frequently expostulated with my father and mother about their being so positively determined against what they knew my inclinations prompted me to. But being one day at Hull, where I went casually, and without any purpose of making an elopement at that time; but, I say, being there, and one of my companions being about to sail to London in his father’s ship, and prompting me to go with them with the common allurement of seafaring men, that it should cost me nothing for my passage, I consulted neither father nor mother any more, nor so much as sent them word of it; but leaving them to hear of it as they might, without asking God’s blessing or my father’s, without any consideration of circumstances or consequences, and in an ill hour, God knows, on the 1st of September 1651, I went on board a ship bound for London. Never any young adventurer’s misfortunes, I believe, began sooner, or continued longer than mine. The ship was no sooner out of the Humber than the wind began to blow and the sea to rise in a most frightful manner; and, as I had never been at sea before, I was most inexpressibly sick in body and terrified in mind. I began now seriously to reflect upon what I had done, and how justly I was overtaken by the judgment of Heaven for my wicked leaving my father’s house, and abandoning my duty. All the good counsels of my parents, my father’s tears and my mother’s entreaties, came now fresh into my mind; and my conscience, which was not yet come to the pitch of hardness to which it has since, reproached me with the contempt of advice, and the breach of my duty to God and my father.

直到一年以后，我才挣脱束缚，尽管与此同时，我仍然固执地对一切谈生意的建议充耳不闻，并且经常向我的父母提出劝告，说他们对他们所知道的我的倾向如此坚决地反对。但是有一天我到了赫尔，我随便去了那里，当时没有任何私奔的意图; 但是，我说，我在那里，而且我的一个同伴正要乘他父亲的船去伦敦，他提醒我和他们一起去，就像航海家一样，这样我的旅费就不会增加了，我既没有向父亲也没有向母亲请教，甚至连一句话也没有向他们传达;但让他们尽可能地去听，不求上帝或我父亲的祝福，不考虑任何情况或后果，在一个不幸的时刻，上帝知道，在1651年的9月1日上，我登上了一艘开往伦敦的船。我相信，从来没有哪个年轻的冒险家的不幸开始得比我更早，或者持续得更久。船刚一离开亨伯河，风就开始刮起来，海面上升得异常可怕; 由于我以前从未在海上航行过，我的身体极度虚弱，心里极度恐惧。我现在开始认真地思考我所做的事情，以及上天对我的惩罚是多么的公正，因为我的罪恶离开了我父亲的家，抛弃了我的职责。我父母所有的忠告，我父亲的眼泪和我母亲的恳求，现在都在我的脑海里重新浮现出来; 我的良心，还没有达到它从那以后所达到的严厉程度，责备我蔑视忠告，违背了我对上帝和我父亲的责任。

All this while the storm increased, and the sea went very high, though nothing like what I have seen many times since; no, nor what I saw a few days after; but it was enough to affect me then, who was but a young sailor, and had never known anything of the matter. I expected every wave would have swallowed us up, and that every time the ship fell down, as I thought it did, in the trough or hollow of the sea, we should never rise more; in this agony of mind, I made many vows and resolutions that if it would please God to spare my life in this one voyage, if ever I got once my foot upon dry land again, I would go directly home to my father, and never set it into a ship again while I lived; that I would take his advice, and never run myself into such miseries as these any more. Now I saw plainly the goodness of his observations about the middle station of life, how easy, how comfortably he had lived all his days, and never had been exposed to tempests at sea or troubles on shore; and I resolved that I would, like a true repenting prodigal, go home to my father.

在这期间，暴风雨越来越大，海浪越来越高，虽然从那以后我再也没有看到过这样的景象，也没有看到过几天以后我看到的景象，但这足以影响到我，因为我当时还是个年轻的水手，对这件事一无所知。在这种心灵的痛苦中，我许下了许多誓言和决心，如果上帝愿意在这次航行中饶恕我的生命，如果我再次踏上陆地，我就直接回家去找我的父亲，在我活着的时候再也不把它放进船里; 我将采纳他的建议，再也不会让自己陷入这样的苦难之中。现在我清楚地看到了他对生活中等阶层的观察的好处，他一生是多么的轻松，多么的舒适，从来没有经历过海上的风暴或者海上的麻烦; 我决定像一个真正的忏悔的浪子一样，回家去找我的父亲。

These wise and sober thoughts continued all the while the storm lasted, and indeed some time after; but the next day the wind was abated, and the sea calmer, and I began to be a little inured to it; however, I was very grave for all that day, being also a little sea-sick still; but towards night the weather cleared up, the wind was quite over, and a charming fine evening followed; the sun went down perfectly clear, and rose so the next morning; and having little or no wind, and a smooth sea, the sun shining upon it, the sight was, as I thought, the most delightful that ever I saw.

但是第二天风减弱了，海面也平静了一些，我开始有点习惯了; 然而，我整天都很严肃，也有点晕船; 但是到了晚上，天气放晴了，风已经停止了，接着是一个美丽的黄昏; 太阳完全落山了，第二天早晨升起来了; 没有风，也没有风，只有一片平静的海面，阳光照在海面上，我认为这是我所见过的最令人愉快的景象。

I had slept well in the night, and was now no more sea-sick, but very cheerful, looking with wonder upon the sea that was so rough and terrible the day before, and could be so calm and so pleasant in so little a time after. And now, lest my good resolutions should continue, my companion, who had enticed me away, comes to me; “Well, Bob,” says he, clapping me upon the shoulder, “how do you do after it? I warrant you were frighted, wer’n’t you, last night, when it blew but a capful of wind?” “A capful d’you call it?” said I; “’twas a terrible storm.” “A storm, you fool you,” replies he; “do you call that a storm? why, it was nothing at all; give us but a good ship and sea-room, and we think nothing of such a squall of wind as that; but you’re but a fresh-water sailor, Bob. Come, let us make a bowl of punch, and we’ll forget all that; d’ye see what charming weather ’tis now?” To make short this sad part of my story, we went the way of all sailors; the punch was made and I was made half drunk with it: and in that one night’s wickedness I drowned all my repentance, all my reflections upon my past conduct, all my resolutions for the future. In a word, as the sea was returned to its smoothness of surface and settled calmness by the abatement of that storm, so the hurry of my thoughts being over, my fears and apprehensions of being swallowed up by the sea being forgotten, and the current of my former desires returned, I entirely forgot the vows and promises that I made in my distress. I found, indeed, some intervals of reflection; and the serious thoughts did, as it were, endeavour to return again sometimes; but I shook them off, and roused myself from them as it were from a distemper, and applying myself to drinking and company, soon mastered the return of those fits—for so I called them; and I had in five or six days got as complete a victory over conscience as any young fellow that resolved not to be troubled with it could desire. But I was to have another trial for it still; and Providence, as in such cases generally it does, resolved to leave me entirely without excuse; for if I would not take this for a deliverance, the next was to be such a one as the worst and most hardened wretch among us would confess both the danger and the mercy of.

我昨天晚上睡得很好，现在不再晕船了，而是非常高兴，带着惊奇的目光望着前一天那么汹涌可怕的大海，一会儿之后又会变得那么平静和愉快。现在，为了不让我的好计划继续下去，我的同伴，那个引诱我走开的人，来到我面前，拍着我的肩膀说: “好吧，鲍勃，你以后怎么样?”？我敢打赌，昨晚刮风的时候，你一定吓坏了，不是吗?”“你称之为满满的?”我说，“那是一场可怕的暴风雨。”“暴风雨，你这个傻瓜,”他回答，“你把它叫做暴风雨吗?”？哎呀，这根本不算什么，给我们一艘好船和一个海舱，我们对这种狂风一点也不在乎，但是鲍勃，你只不过是一个淡水水手。来吧，我们做一碗潘趣酒，把这一切都忘掉，你看现在天气多好啊!”为了简化我故事中这个悲伤的部分，我们走了所有水手的路; 打了一拳，我喝了一半; 在那一夜的邪恶中，我淹没了我所有的忏悔，所有对我过去行为的反思，所有对未来的决心。一言以蔽之，当海面恢复平静，风暴平息，我思绪的匆忙过去，我被大海吞没的恐惧和忧虑被遗忘，我以前的愿望的潮流回来，我完全忘记了我在痛苦中所作的誓言和承诺。事实上，我发现有些时候我在反思，那些严肃的思想有时候确实想再回来; 但是我把它们摆脱掉，把自己从那些思想中唤醒，好像它们是从一种疾病中唤醒一样，我把自己投入到饮酒和陪伴中去，很快就恢复了那种痉挛的状态ーー因此我这样称呼它们; 在五六天的时间里，我完全战胜了良心，就像任何一个决心不受良心困扰的年轻人所渴望的那样。但是我还要为此再接受一次审判; 而上帝，正如通常在这种情况下所做的那样，决定毫无借口地离开我; 因为如果我不把这当作一次解脱，那么下一次就会变成我们中间最坏、最顽固的坏蛋，既承认危险，又承认仁慈。

The sixth day of our being at sea we came into Yarmouth Roads; the wind having been contrary and the weather calm, we had made but little way since the storm. Here we were obliged to come to an anchor, and here we lay, the wind continuing contrary—viz. at south-west—for seven or eight days, during which time a great many ships from Newcastle came into the same Roads, as the common harbour where the ships might wait for a wind for the river.

我们在海上航行的第六天来到了 Yarmouth Roads，风向逆转，天气平静，自从暴风雨以来我们几乎没有前进。我们不得不在这里抛锚，就在这里停泊，风继续逆风行驶。在西南方，有七、八天的时间，许多船只从纽卡斯尔来到同一条道路，作为公共港口，船只可以在那里等待风向。

We had not, however, rid here so long but we should have tided it up the river, but that the wind blew too fresh, and after we had lain four or five days, blew very hard. However, the Roads being reckoned as good as a harbour, the anchorage good, and our ground-tackle very strong, our men were unconcerned, and not in the least apprehensive of danger, but spent the time in rest and mirth, after the manner of the sea; but the eighth day, in the morning, the wind increased, and we had all hands at work to strike our topmasts, and make everything snug and close, that the ship might ride as easy as possible. By noon the sea went very high indeed, and our ship rode forecastle in, shipped several seas, and we thought once or twice our anchor had come home; upon which our master ordered out the sheet-anchor, so that we rode with two anchors ahead, and the cables veered out to the bitter end.

然而，我们在这里停留的时间并不长，我们本来可以顺流而上，但是风太大了，我们在这里停留了四五天之后，风刮得很厉害。然而，我们的船员们并不担心危险，一点也不担心，而是按照大海的样子，在休息和欢乐中度过了一段时间。但是第八天，早晨，风力增强了，我们全力以赴地打击顶桅杆，使一切尽可能舒适和紧凑，使船能够尽可能轻松地航行。到了中午，海面确实涨得很高，我们的船驶上了前甲板，航行了好几个海域，我们有一两次以为我们的锚已经回家了，于是我们的主人命令我们把锚拉起来，这样我们就带着两个锚向前驶去，缆绳转向到了痛苦的一端。

By this time it blew a terrible storm indeed; and now I began to see terror and amazement in the faces even of the seamen themselves. The master, though vigilant in the business of preserving the ship, yet as he went in and out of his cabin by me, I could hear him softly to himself say, several times, “Lord be merciful to us! we shall be all lost! we shall be all undone!” and the like. During these first hurries I was stupid, lying still in my cabin, which was in the steerage, and cannot describe my temper: I could ill resume the first penitence which I had so apparently trampled upon and hardened myself against: I thought the bitterness of death had been past, and that this would be nothing like the first; but when the master himself came by me, as I said just now, and said we should be all lost, I was dreadfully frighted. I got up out of my cabin and looked out; but such a dismal sight I never saw: the sea ran mountains high, and broke upon us every three or four minutes; when I could look about, I could see nothing but distress round us; two ships that rode near us, we found, had cut their masts by the board, being deep laden; and our men cried out that a ship which rode about a mile ahead of us was foundered. Two more ships, being driven from their anchors, were run out of the Roads to sea, at all adventures, and that with not a mast standing. The light ships fared the best, as not so much labouring in the sea; but two or three of them drove, and came close by us, running away with only their spritsail out before the wind.

这时，真的刮起了一场可怕的暴风雨，现在我甚至看到水手们的脸上都充满了恐惧和惊愕。船长虽然很注意保护船只，但是当他在我身边进进出出他的船舱时，我能听见他轻声地自言自语，好几次说: “主啊，怜悯我们吧！我们都会迷失！我们都会被毁灭!”诸如此类。在最初的匆忙中，我很愚蠢，一动不动地躺在统舱里，无法形容我的脾气: 我可以重新开始第一次的忏悔，那是我曾经明显地被践踏和强化过的。我从船舱里站起来向外望去，但是我从来没有看到过这样凄凉的景象: 大海高耸入云，每隔三四分钟就冲击我们一次; 当我可以向四周望去时，我只能看到我们周围的一切，只有苦难; 我们发现，两艘靠近我们的船被帆板割断了桅杆，满载着沉重的货物; 我们的船员大声喊道，我们前面大约一英里处的一艘船沉了。又有两艘船被从锚上赶下来，冒着各种风险，离开大路驶向大海，而那条船上没有一根桅杆。那些轻型船只在海上航行得最好，因为它们并没有在海上那么吃力; 但是有两三艘轻型船只开过来，靠近我们，只带着它们的精神帆在风前飞驰而去。

Towards evening the mate and boatswain begged the master of our ship to let them cut away the fore-mast, which he was very unwilling to do; but the boatswain protesting to him that if he did not the ship would founder, he consented; and when they had cut away the fore-mast, the main-mast stood so loose, and shook the ship so much, they were obliged to cut that away also, and make a clear deck.

快到傍晚的时候，大副和水手长请求我们的船长割掉前桅，他非常不愿意这样做; 但是水手长向他抗议说，如果他不割掉前桅，船就会沉没，他同意了; 当他们割掉前桅时，主桅松得厉害，船摇晃得厉害，他们不得不把前桅也割掉，把甲板清理干净。

Any one may judge what a condition I must be in at all this, who was but a young sailor, and who had been in such a fright before at but a little. But if I can express at this distance the thoughts I had about me at that time, I was in tenfold more horror of mind upon account of my former convictions, and the having returned from them to the resolutions I had wickedly taken at first, than I was at death itself; and these, added to the terror of the storm, put me into such a condition that I can by no words describe it. But the worst was not come yet; the storm continued with such fury that the seamen themselves acknowledged they had never seen a worse. We had a good ship, but she was deep laden, and wallowed in the sea, so that the seamen every now and then cried out she would founder. It was my advantage in one respect, that I did not know what they meant by founder till I inquired. However, the storm was so violent that I saw, what is not often seen, the master, the boatswain, and some others more sensible than the rest, at their prayers, and expecting every moment when the ship would go to the bottom. In the middle of the night, and under all the rest of our distresses, one of the men that had been down to see cried out we had sprung a leak; another said there was four feet water in the hold. Then all hands were called to the pump. At that word, my heart, as I thought, died within me: and I fell backwards upon the side of my bed where I sat, into the cabin. However, the men roused me, and told me that I, that was able to do nothing before, was as well able to pump as another; at which I stirred up and went to the pump, and worked very heartily. While this was doing the master, seeing some light colliers, who, not able to ride out the storm were obliged to slip and run away to sea, and would come near us, ordered to fire a gun as a signal of distress. I, who knew nothing what they meant, thought the ship had broken, or some dreadful thing happened. In a word, I was so surprised that I fell down in a swoon. As this was a time when everybody had his own life to think of, nobody minded me, or what was become of me; but another man stepped up to the pump, and thrusting me aside with his foot, let me lie, thinking I had been dead; and it was a great while before I came to myself.

任何人都可以判断我在这种情况下一定处于什么样的状态，谁不过是一个年轻的水手，谁曾经有过这样的惊吓，只有一点点。但是，如果我能在这么远的距离上表达出我当时对自己的想法，我的心里因为我以前的信念而感到十倍的恐惧，因为我从那些信念中回过头来又回到了我一开始所做的那些恶毒的决定上，而我自己却处在死亡的边缘; 这些，加上暴风雨的恐怖，使我陷入了无法用语言来描述的境地。但是最糟糕的情况还没有到来，暴风雨继续肆虐，水手们自己也承认，他们从未见过如此糟糕的情况。我们有一艘很好的船，但是它载着沉重的货物，在海里打滚，所以水手们时不时地叫喊着它会沉没。在一个方面，我的优势在于，在我询问之前，我不知道他们所说的创始人是什么意思。然而，暴风雨是如此猛烈，以至于我在祈祷时看到了船长、水手长以及其他一些比其他人更明智的人，他们时时刻刻都在期待着船沉到海底。半夜里，在我们所有其他的烦恼之下，一个下来看我们的人喊道，我们漏水了; 另一个说货舱里有四英尺深的水。然后，所有的工作人员都被召集到抽水机旁。听到这句话，我的心，正如我所想的，在我的心里死去了。我向后倒在我所坐的床边，进了小屋。然而，那些人唤醒了我，告诉我，我以前什么也做不了，现在也可以像别人一样抽水了，于是我就兴奋起来，走到抽水机前，尽情地工作。当船长这样做的时候，看到一些无法安然渡过暴风雨的轻型矿工，他们不得不偷偷溜到海上，然后走近我们，命令他们开枪以示求救。我不知道那是什么意思，以为船坏了，或者发生了什么可怕的事情。总而言之，我很惊讶，一下子晕倒了。因为那时每个人都有自己的生活要考虑，所以没有人关心我，也没有人关心我后来怎么样了; 但是另一个人走上前来，用脚把我推到一边，让我躺着，以为我已经死了; 过了很长一段时间我才苏醒过来。

We worked on; but the water increasing in the hold, it was apparent that the ship would founder; and though the storm began to abate a little, yet it was not possible she could swim till we might run into any port; so the master continued firing guns for help; and a light ship, who had rid it out just ahead of us, ventured a boat out to help us. It was with the utmost hazard the boat came near us; but it was impossible for us to get on board, or for the boat to lie near the ship’s side, till at last the men rowing very heartily, and venturing their lives to save ours, our men cast them a rope over the stern with a buoy to it, and then veered it out a great length, which they, after much labour and hazard, took hold of, and we hauled them close under our stern, and got all into their boat. It was to no purpose for them or us, after we were in the boat, to think of reaching their own ship; so all agreed to let her drive, and only to pull her in towards shore as much as we could; and our master promised them, that if the boat was staved upon shore, he would make it good to their master: so partly rowing and partly driving, our boat went away to the northward, sloping towards the shore almost as far as Winterton Ness.

我们继续工作; 但是船舱里的水越来越多，很明显船要沉了; 虽然暴风雨开始减弱了一点，但是我们不可能游到任何港口，所以船长继续鸣枪求救; 一艘轻型船在我们前面摆脱了它，冒险派了一艘小船来帮助我们。船冒着极大的危险靠近我们，但是我们不可能上船，也不可能让船靠近船边，直到最后船员们拼命地划船，冒着生命危险救我们的命，我们的船员把一根绳子抛在船尾，上面还有一个浮标，然后把船转向很远的地方，他们费了很大的劲，冒着很大的风险，抓住了船，我们把他们拉到船尾下面，全部上了船。我们上了船以后，他们和我们都没有必要去想到达他们自己的船; 所以大家都同意让她开船，只是尽可能地把她拉到岸边; 我们的主人向他们保证，如果把船搁在岸上，他会对他们的主人好一点: 所以一部分是划船，一部分是开船，我们的船向北驶去，向岸边倾斜，几乎一直到温特顿内斯。

We were not much more than a quarter of an hour out of our ship till we saw her sink, and then I understood for the first time what was meant by a ship foundering in the sea. I must acknowledge I had hardly eyes to look up when the seamen told me she was sinking; for from the moment that they rather put me into the boat than that I might be said to go in, my heart was, as it were, dead within me, partly with fright, partly with horror of mind, and the thoughts of what was yet before me.

我们离开船只还不到一刻钟，就看到船沉了，这时我才第一次明白了船在海里沉没是什么意思。我必须承认，当水手告诉我船正在下沉的时候，我几乎没有抬头的眼睛; 因为从他们把我放进船里的那一刻起，我的心好像已经死了，一部分是因为恐惧，一部分是因为心里的恐惧，一部分是因为对眼前事物的思考。

While we were in this condition—the men yet labouring at the oar to bring the boat near the shore—we could see (when, our boat mounting the waves, we were able to see the shore) a great many people running along the strand to assist us when we should come near; but we made but slow way towards the shore; nor were we able to reach the shore till, being past the lighthouse at Winterton, the shore falls off to the westward towards Cromer, and so the land broke off a little the violence of the wind. Here we got in, and though not without much difficulty, got all safe on shore, and walked afterwards on foot to Yarmouth, where, as unfortunate men, we were used with great humanity, as well by the magistrates of the town, who assigned us good quarters, as by particular merchants and owners of ships, and had money given us sufficient to carry us either to London or back to Hull as we thought fit.

当我们处于这种状态时，我们可以看到(当我们的船在波浪上行驶时，我们可以看到海岸)有很多人沿着海岸跑来帮助我们，但是我们只是慢慢地向海岸走去，我们也无法到达海岸，直到经过温特顿的灯塔，海岸向西流向克罗默，因此陆地稍微停止了狂风的吹拂。我们到了这里，虽然没有多少困难，但是都安全上了岸，然后步行到了雅茅斯，在那里，作为一个不幸的人，我们被镇上的地方官们以极大的仁慈所利用，他们给我们分配了好的住处，有特定的商人和船主，并且给我们足够的钱，可以把我们送到伦敦或者我们认为合适的地方回赫尔。

Had I now had the sense to have gone back to Hull, and have gone home, I had been happy, and my father, as in our blessed Saviour’s parable, had even killed the fatted calf for me; for hearing the ship I went away in was cast away in Yarmouth Roads, it was a great while before he had any assurances that I was not drowned.

如果我现在有意识回到赫尔，回家了，我会很高兴的，我的父亲，就像我们神圣的救世主的寓言一样，甚至为我杀死了肥牛犊; 因为听说我离开的那艘船在 Yarmouth Roads 被抛弃了，过了很长一段时间他才确信我没有淹死。

But my ill fate pushed me on now with an obstinacy that nothing could resist; and though I had several times loud calls from my reason and my more composed judgment to go home, yet I had no power to do it. I know not what to call this, nor will I urge that it is a secret overruling decree, that hurries us on to be the instruments of our own destruction, even though it be before us, and that we rush upon it with our eyes open. Certainly, nothing but some such decreed unavoidable misery, which it was impossible for me to escape, could have pushed me forward against the calm reasonings and persuasions of my most retired thoughts, and against two such visible instructions as I had met with in my first attempt.

但是我命运的不幸，现在以一种任何东西都无法抗拒的固执，推着我继续前进; 虽然我的理智和冷静的判断多次大声呼唤我回家，但我还是没有能力这样做。我不知道该如何称呼它，也不会强烈要求它是一个秘密的推翻法令，迫使我们成为我们自己毁灭的工具，即使它就在我们面前，我们睁着眼睛冲向它。当然，除了一些我无法逃避的不可避免的痛苦之外，别的什么也不能把我推向前去，不顾我那最隐秘的思想的平静的推理和说服，也不顾我第一次尝试时遇到的两个明显的指示。

My comrade, who had helped to harden me before, and who was the master’s son, was now less forward than I. The first time he spoke to me after we were at Yarmouth, which was not till two or three days, for we were separated in the town to several quarters; I say, the first time he saw me, it appeared his tone was altered; and, looking very melancholy, and shaking his head, he asked me how I did, and telling his father who I was, and how I had come this voyage only for a trial, in order to go further abroad, his father, turning to me with a very grave and concerned tone “Young man,” says he, “you ought never to go to sea any more; you ought to take this for a plain and visible token that you are not to be a seafaring man.” “Why, sir,” said I, “will you go to sea no more?” “That is another case,” said he; “it is my calling, and therefore my duty; but as you made this voyage on trial, you see what a taste Heaven has given you of what you are to expect if you persist. Perhaps this has all befallen us on your account, like Jonah in the ship of Tarshish. Pray,” continues he, “what are you; and on what account did you go to sea?” Upon that I told him some of my story; at the end of which he burst out into a strange kind of passion: “What had I done,” says he, “that such an unhappy wretch should come into my ship? I would not set my foot in the same ship with thee again for a thousand pounds.” This indeed was, as I said, an excursion of his spirits, which were yet agitated by the sense of his loss, and was farther than he could have authority to go. However, he afterwards talked very gravely to me, exhorting me to go back to my father, and not tempt Providence to my ruin, telling me I might see a visible hand of Heaven against me. “And, young man,” said he, “depend upon it, if you do not go back, wherever you go, you will meet with nothing but disasters and disappointments, till your father’s words are fulfilled upon you.”

我的同伴，以前曾帮助我使我变得坚强，也是主人的儿子，现在却不如我勇敢了。我说，他第一次见到我的时候，语气似乎变了; 他看上去非常忧郁，摇着头，问我怎么样，然后告诉他的父亲我是谁，我来这里只是为了试探一下，为了出国，他的父亲非常严肃而忧虑地对我说: “年轻人,”他说，“你再也不应该出海了，你应该把这个当作明摆着的信物，告诉我你不是一个航海家。”“为什么，先生,”我说，“你不再出海了吗?”“那是另外一回事,”他说，“这是我的使命，因此也是我的责任，但是当你在这次航行中受到审判时，你就会明白，如果你坚持下去，上天会给你带来什么样的滋味。也许这一切都是因你而降临在我们身上，就像约拿在他施的船上一样。“请问,”他继续说，“你是什么人? 你为什么要出海?”说完，我把我的故事告诉了他，最后他突然爆发出一种奇怪的激情: “我做了什么,”他说，“竟然让这样一个不幸的家伙上了我的船？就算给我一千镑，我也不愿意再跟你上同一条船正如我所说的，这的确是他精神上的一种游移，他的精神因为他的失去而感到不安，而且他无权前往更远的地方。然而，他后来非常严肃地对我说话，劝我回到父亲身边，不要让上帝把我引向毁灭，告诉我说我可能会看到一只看得见的上帝之手在对付我。“而且，年轻人,”他说，“相信我，如果你不回去，无论你去哪里，你将遇到的只有灾难和失望，直到你父亲的话落到你身上。”

We parted soon after; for I made him little answer, and I saw him no more; which way he went I knew not. As for me, having some money in my pocket, I travelled to London by land; and there, as well as on the road, had many struggles with myself what course of life I should take, and whether I should go home or to sea.

我们很快就分手了，因为我没有回答他，也没有再见到他，我不知道他往哪个方向走了。至于我，口袋里有一些钱，我从陆路去伦敦; 在那里，在路上，我有许多问题要问自己，我应该走什么样的人生道路，我应该回家还是出海。

As to going home, shame opposed the best motions that offered to my thoughts, and it immediately occurred to me how I should be laughed at among the neighbours, and should be ashamed to see, not my father and mother only, but even everybody else; from whence I have since often observed, how incongruous and irrational the common temper of mankind is, especially of youth, to that reason which ought to guide them in such cases—viz. that they are not ashamed to sin, and yet are ashamed to repent; not ashamed of the action for which they ought justly to be esteemed fools, but are ashamed of the returning, which only can make them be esteemed wise men.

至于回家，羞愧反对我所想到的最好的动作，我立刻想到我应该怎样被邻居们嘲笑，应该感到羞愧，不仅是我的父母，而且是其他所有人; 从那时起，我经常观察到，人类的共同脾气，特别是年轻人的脾气，与在这种情况下应该引导他们的理由是多么的不协调和不合理。他们不以罪恶为耻，却羞于悔改; 不以他们应该受到尊敬的傻瓜的行为为耻，而是以回归为耻，这只会使他们成为受尊敬的智者。

In this state of life, however, I remained some time, uncertain what measures to take, and what course of life to lead. An irresistible reluctance continued to going home; and as I stayed away a while, the remembrance of the distress I had been in wore off, and as that abated, the little motion I had in my desires to return wore off with it, till at last I quite laid aside the thoughts of it, and looked out for a voyage.

然而，在这种生活状态下，我仍然有一段时间不确定该采取什么措施，以及该走什么样的人生道路。一种不可抗拒的不情愿继续回家; 我离开了一段时间，我对自己所遭受的痛苦的记忆逐渐消失了，随着这种记忆的消失，我想回家的那种小小的动作也随之消失了，直到最后我把这种想法完全放在一边，开始寻找一次航行。
